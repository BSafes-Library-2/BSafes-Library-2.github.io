Researchers Find a Way Malicious NPM Libraries Can Evade Vulnerability Detection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/researchers-find-way-malicious-npm.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New findings from cybersecurity firm JFrog show that malware targeting the npm ecosystem can evade security checks by taking advantage of an "unexpected behavior" in the npm command line interface (CLI) tool.  npm CLI's  install  and  audit   commands  have built-in capabilities to check a package and all of its dependencies for known vulnerabilities, effectively acting as a warning mechanism for developers by highlighting the flaws.  But as JFrog established, the security advisories are not displayed when the packages follow certain version formats, creating a scenario where critical flaws could be introduced into their systems either directly or via the package's dependencies.   Specifically, the problem arises only when the installed package version contains a hyphen (e.g., 1.2.3-a), which is included to denote a  pre-release version  of an npm module.  While the project maintainers treat the discrepancy between regular npm package versions and pre-release version

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious Android SMS application discovered on the Google Play Store has been found to stealthily harvest text messages with the goal of creating accounts on a wide range of platforms like Facebook, Google, and WhatsApp.  The app, named  Symoo  (com.vanjan.sms), had over 100,000 downloads and functioned as a relay for transmitting messages to a server, which advertises an account creation service.  This is achieved by using the phone numbers associated with the infected devices as a means to gather the one-time password that's typically sent to verify the user when setting up new accounts.   "The malware asks the phone number of the user in the first screen," security researcher Maxime Ingrao, who discovered the malware,  said , while also requesting for SMS permissions.  "Then it pretends to load the application but remains all the time on this page, it is to hide the interface of the received SMS and that the user does not see the SMS of subscriptions to the va

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The French data protection watchdog on Tuesday fined electricity provider Électricité de France  €600,000 for violating the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements.  The Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (CNIL)  said  the electric utility breached European regulation by storing the passwords for over 25,800 accounts by hashing them using the  MD5 algorithm  as recently as July 2022.  It's worth noting that MD5, a message digest algorithm, is considered cryptographically broken as of December 2008  owing to the risk of  collision attacks .   Furthermore, the authority noted that the passwords associated with 2,414,254 customer accounts had only been hashed and not  salted , exposing the account holders to potential cyber threats.  The probe also pointed fingers at EDF for failing to comply with GDPR data retention policies and for providing "inaccurate information on the origin of the data collected."  "The amoun

Australia Passes Bill to Fine Companies up to $50 Million for Data Breaches<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/australia-passes-bill-to-fine-companies.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Australian government has passed a bill that markedly increases the penalty for companies suffering from serious or repeated data breaches.  To that end, the maximum fines have been bumped up from the current AU$2.22 million to AU$50 million, 30% of an entity's adjusted turnover in the relevant period, or three times the value of any benefit obtained through the misuse of information, whichever is greater.  The turnover period is the time duration from when the contravention occurred to the end of the month when the incident is officially addressed.   "Significant privacy breaches in recent months have shown existing safeguards are outdated and inadequate," Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus  said  in a statement. "These reforms make clear to companies that the penalty for a major data breach can no longer be regarded as the cost of doing business."  The legislation, called the Privacy Legislation Amendment (Enforcement and Other Measures) Bill 2022, also bestow

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed details of three new security vulnerabilities affecting operational technology (OT) products from CODESYS and Festo that could lead to source code tampering and denial-of-service (DoS).  The vulnerabilities, reported by Forescout Vedere Labs, are the latest in a long list of flaws collectively tracked under the name  OT:ICEFALL .  "These issues exemplify either an insecure-by-design approach — which was usual at the time the products were launched – where manufacturers include dangerous functions that can be accessed with no authentication or a subpar implementation of security controls, such as cryptography," the researchers  said .   The most critical of the flaws is  CVE-2022-3270  (CVSS score: 9.8), a critical vulnerability that affects Festo automation controllers using the Festo Generic Multicast (FGMC) protocol to reboot the devices without requiring any authentication and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

A threat actor with a suspected China nexus has been linked to a set of espionage attacks in the Philippines that primarily relies on USB devices as an initial infection vector.  Mandiant, which is part of Google Cloud, is tracking the cluster under its uncategorized moniker  UNC4191 . An analysis of the artifacts used in the intrusions indicates that the campaign dates as far back as September 2021.  "UNC4191 operations have affected a range of public and private sector entities primarily in Southeast Asia and extending to the U.S., Europe, and APJ," researchers Ryan Tomcik, John Wolfram, Tommy Dacanay, and Geoff Ackerman  said .   "However, even when targeted organizations were based in other locations, the specific systems targeted by UNC4191 were also found to be physically located in the Philippines."  The reliance on infected USB drives to propagate the malware is unusual if  not new . The  Raspberry Robin  worm, which has  evolved  into an initial access ser

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Acer has released a firmware update to address a security vulnerability that could be potentially weaponized to turn off UEFI Secure Boot on affected machines.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-4020 , the high-severity vulnerability affects five different models that consist of Aspire A315-22, A115-21, and A315-22G, and Extensa EX215-21 and EX215-21G.   The PC maker described the vulnerability as an issue that "may allow changes to Secure Boot settings by creating NVRAM variables." Credited with  discovering  the flaw is ESET researcher Martin Smolár, who previously disclosed  similar bugs  in Lenovo computers.  Disabling Secure Boot, an integrity mechanism that guarantees that only trusted software is loaded during system startup, enables a malicious actor to tamper with  boot loaders , leading to severe consequences.  This includes  granting  the attacker complete control over the operating system loading process as well as "disable or bypass protections to silently deploy their

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are capitalizing on a popular TikTok challenge to trick users into downloading information-stealing malware, according to new research from Checkmarx.  The trend, called  Invisible Challenge , involves applying a filter known as  Invisible Body  that just leaves behind a silhouette of the person's body.  But the fact that individuals filming such videos could be undressed has led to a nefarious scheme wherein the attackers post TikTok videos with links to rogue software dubbed "unfilter" that purport to remove the applied filters.   "Instructions to get the 'unfilter' software deploy  WASP stealer malware  hiding inside malicious Python packages," Checkmarx researcher Guy Nachshon  said  in a Monday analysis.  The WASP stealer (aka W4SP Stealer) is a malware that's designed to steal users' passwords, Discord accounts, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive information.

When the headlines focus on breaches of large enterprises like the Optus breach, it's easy for smaller businesses to think they're not a target for hackers. Surely, they're not worth the time or effort?   Unfortunately, when it comes to cyber security, size doesn't matter.   Assuming you're not a target leads to lax security practices in many SMBs who lack the knowledge or expertise to put simple security steps in place. Few small businesses prioritise cybersecurity, and hackers know it. According to Verizon, the number of smaller businesses being hit has climbed steadily in the last few years – 46% of cyber breaches in 2021 impacted businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees.   Cyber security doesn't need to be difficult  Securing any business doesn't need to be complex or come with a hefty price tag. Here are seven simple tips to help the smaller business secure their systems, people and data.  1 — Install anti-virus software everywhere   Every organisation has anti-virus on the

Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has  levied fines  of €265 million ($277 million) against Meta Platforms for failing to safeguard the personal data of more than half a billion users of its Facebook service, ramping up privacy enforcement against U.S. tech firms.  The fines follow an inquiry initiated by the European regulator on April 14, 2021, close on the heels of a leak of a "collated dataset of Facebook personal data that had been made available on the internet."  This included the  personal information  associated with 533 million users of the social media platform, such as their phone numbers, dates of birth, locations, email addresses, gender, marital status, account creation date, and other profile details.   Meta acknowledged that the information was "old data" that was obtained by malicious actors by taking advantage of a technique called "phone number enumeration" to  scrape users' public profiles .

CISA Warns of Actively Exploited Critical Oracle Fusion Middleware Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/cisa-warns-of-actively-exploited.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Monday  added  a critical flaw impacting Oracle Fusion Middleware to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) Catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation.  The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2021-35587 , carries a CVSS score of 9.8 and impacts Oracle Access Manager (OAM) versions 11.1.2.3.0, 12.2.1.3.0, and 12.2.1.4.0.   Successful exploitation of the remote command execution bug could enable an unauthenticated attacker with network access to completely compromise and take over Access Manager instances.  "It may give the attacker access to OAM server, to create any user with any privileges, or just get code execution in the victim's server," Vietnamese security researcher Nguyen Jang ( Janggggg ), who reported the bug alongside  peterjson ,  noted  earlier this March.   The issue was addressed by Oracle as part of its  Critical Patch Update  in January 2022.   Additional details regarding the natu

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Amazon Web Services (AWS) has resolved a cross-tenant vulnerability in its platform that could be weaponized by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to resources.  The issue relates to a  confused deputy problem , a type of privilege escalation where a program that doesn't have permission to perform an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform the action.  The shortcoming was reported by Datadog to AWS on September 1, 2022, following which a patch was shipped on September 6.  "This attack abuses the AppSync service to assume [identity and access management]  roles  in other AWS accounts, which allows an attacker to pivot into a victim organization and access resources in those accounts," Datadog researcher Nick Frichette  said  in a report published last week.   In a coordinated disclosure, Amazon  said  that no customers were affected by the vulnerability and that no customer action is required.  It described it as a "case-sensitivity parsing issue w

Over a dozen security flaws have been discovered in baseboard management controller ( BMC ) firmware from Lanner that could expose operational technology (OT) and internet of things (IoT) networks to remote attacks.  BMC refers to a specialized service processor, a system-on-chip (SoC), that's found in server motherboards and is used for remote monitoring and management of a host system, including performing low-level system operations such as  firmware flashing  and power control.   Nozomi Networks, which analyzed an Intelligent Platform Management Interface ( IPMC ) from Taiwanese vendor Lanner Electronics, said it uncovered 13 weaknesses affecting  IAC-AST2500 .  All the issues affect version 1.10.0 of the standard firmware, with the exception of CVE-2021-4228, which impacts version 1.00.0. Four of the flaws (from CVE-2021-26727 to CVE-2021-26730) are rated 10 out of 10 on the CVSS scoring system.   In particular, the industrial security company found that CVE-2021-44467, an ac

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Twitter chief executive Elon Musk confirmed plans for end-to-end encryption ( E2EE ) for direct messages on the platform.  The  feature  is part of Musk's vision for Twitter 2.0, which is expected to be what's called an "everything app." Other functionalities include longform tweets and payments, according to a slide deck shared by Musk over the weekend.   The company's plans for encrypted messages first came to light in mid-November 2022, when mobile researcher Jane Manchun Wong  spotted  source code changes in Twitter's Android app referencing conversation keys for E2EE chats.  It's worth noting that various other messaging platforms, such as Signal, Threema, WhatsApp, iMessage, Wire, Tox, and Keybase, already support encryption for messages.  Google, which previously turned on E2EE for  one-to-one chats  in its RCS-based Messages app for Android, is currently piloting the same option for group chats. Facebook, likewise, began  enabling E2EE  on Messeng

For 6 months, the infamous Emotet botnet has shown almost no activity, and now it's distributing malicious spam. Let's dive into details and discuss all you need to know about the notorious malware to combat it.  Why is everyone scared of Emotet?  Emotet  is by far one of the most dangerous trojans ever created. The malware became a very destructive program as it grew in scale and sophistication. The victim can be anyone from corporate to private users exposed to spam email campaigns.  The botnet distributes through phishing containing malicious Excel or Word documents. When users open these documents and enable macros, the Emotet DLL downloads and then loads into memory.  It searches for email addresses and steals them for spam campaigns. Moreover, the botnet drops additional payloads, such as Cobalt Strike or other attacks that lead to ransomware.  The polymorphic nature of Emotet, along with the many modules it includes, makes the malware challenging to identify. The Emotet

"These new rules are an important part of our ongoing actions to protect the American people from national security threats involving telecommunications."

Ukraine has come under a fresh onslaught of ransomware attacks that mirror previous intrusions attributed to the Russia-based Sandworm nation-state group.  Slovak cybersecurity company ESET, which dubbed the new ransomware strain  RansomBoggs , said the attacks against several Ukrainian entities were first detected on November 21, 2022.  "While the malware written in .NET is new, its deployment is similar to previous attacks attributed to Sandworm," the company  said  in a series of tweets Friday.   The development comes as the Sandworm actor, tracked by Microsoft as Iridium, was implicated for a set of attacks aimed at transportation and logistics sectors in Ukraine and Poland with another ransomware strain called  Prestige  in October 2022.  The RansomBoggs activity is said to employ a PowerShell script to distribute the ransomware, with the latter "almost identical" to the one used in the  Industroyer2 malware  attacks that came to light in April.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Thursday released software updates to address yet another zero-day flaw in its Chrome web browser.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-4135 , the high-severity vulnerability has been described as a heap buffer overflow in the GPU component. Clement Lecigne of Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been credited with reporting the flaw on November 22, 2022.  Heap-based buffer overflow bugs can be  weaponized  by threat actors to crash a program or execute arbitrary code, leading to unintended behavior.  According to the NIST's National Vulnerability Database, the flaw could  permit a "remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page."  "Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2022-4135 exists in the wild," the tech giant  acknowledged  in an advisory.  But like other actively exploited issues, technical specifics have been withheld until a majority of the users are updated with a fix and t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of firmware images across devices from Dell, HP, and Lenovo has revealed the presence of outdated versions of the  OpenSSL  cryptographic library, underscoring a supply chain risk.  EFI Development Kit, aka  EDK , is an open source implementation of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ), which functions as an interface between the operating system and the firmware embedded in the device's hardware.  The firmware development environment, which is in its second iteration (EDK II), comes with its own cryptographic package called  CryptoPkg  that, in turn, makes use of services from the OpenSSL project.   Per firmware security company Binarly, the firmware image associated with Lenovo Thinkpad enterprise devices was found to use three different versions of OpenSSL: 0.9.8zb, 1.0.0a, and 1.0.2j, the last of which was released in 2018.  What's more, one of the firmware modules named InfineonTpmUpdateDxe relied on OpenSSL version 0.9.8zb that was shipped on Au

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coordinated law enforcement effort has dismantled an online phone number spoofing service called  iSpoof  and arrested 142 individuals linked to the operation.  The websites, ispoof[.]me and ispoof[.]cc, allowed the crooks to "impersonate trusted corporations or contacts to access sensitive information from victims," Europol  said  in a press statement.  Worldwide losses exceeded €115 million ($ 119.8 million), with over 200,000 potential victims believed to have been directly targeted through iSpoof in the U.K. alone, the Metropolitan Police  noted .    Among the 142 people arrested is the administrator of the website, who was apprehended in the U.K. on November 6, 2022. The website and its server were subsequently seized and taken offline two days later by Ukrainian and U.S. agencies.  Per the National Police Corps, the helpdesk fraud  allowed  registered subscribers on the online portal to mask their phone numbers and make calls impersonating banks, retail companies, an

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Interpol on Thursday  announced  the seizure of $130 million worth of virtual assets in connection with a global crackdown on cyber-enabled financial crimes and money laundering.  The international police operation, dubbed  HAECHI-III , transpired between June 28 and November 23, 2022, resulting in the arrests of 975 individuals and the closure of more than 1,600 cases.  This comprised two fugitives wanted by South Korea for their supposed involvement in a Ponzi scheme to embezzle €28 million from 2,000 victims.   Another instance pertained to a call center scam based out of India, wherein a group of criminals impersonated Interpol and Europol officers to trick victims in Austria into transferring funds. The call centers operated from New Delhi and Noida.  The illegal activity informed the victims that their "identities were stolen and crime pertaining to narcotics drugs were committed in their names," forcing them to make a money transfer.

New RansomExx Ransomware Variant Rewritten in the Rust Programming Language<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/new-ransomexx-ransomware-variant.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators of the RansomExx ransomware have become the latest to develop a new variant fully rewritten in the Rust programming language, following other strains like  BlackCat ,  Hive , and  Luna .  The latest version, dubbed RansomExx2 by the threat actor known as Hive0091 (aka DefrayX), is primarily designed to run on the Linux operating system, although it's expected that a Windows version will be released in the future.   RansomExx, also known as Defray777 and Ransom X, is a  ransomware   family  that's known to be active since 2018. It has since been linked to a number of attacks on government agencies, manufacturers, and other high-profile entities like Embraer and GIGABYTE.  "Malware written in Rust often benefits from lower [antivirus] detection rates (compared to those written in more common languages) and this may have been the primary reason to use the language," IBM Security X-Force researcher Charlotte Hammond  said  in a report published this week.

A set of five medium-severity security flaws in Arm's Mali GPU driver has continued to remain unpatched on Android devices for months, despite fixes released by the chipmaker.  Google Project Zero, which discovered and reported the bugs, said Arm addressed the shortcomings in July and August 2022.  "These fixes have not yet made it downstream to affected Android devices (including Pixel, Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, and others)," Project Zero researcher Ian Beer  said  in a report. "Devices with a Mali GPU are currently vulnerable."  The vulnerabilities, collectively tracked under the identifiers  CVE-2022-33917  (CVSS score: 5.5) and  CVE-2022-36449  (CVSS score: 6.5), concern a case of improper memory processing, thereby allowing a non-privileged user to gain access to freed memory.   The second flaw, CVE-2022-36449, can be further weaponized to write outside of buffer bounds and disclose details of memory mappings, according to an  advisory  issued by Arm. The lis

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The cyber espionage group known as Bahamut  has been attributed as behind a highly targeted campaign that infects users of Android devices with malicious apps designed to extract sensitive information.  The activity, which has been active since January 2022, entails distributing rogue VPN apps through a fake SecureVPN website set up for this purpose, Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET  said  in a new report shared with The Hacker News.  At least eight different variants of the spyware apps have been discovered to date, with them being trojanized versions of legitimate VPN apps like  SoftVPN  and  OpenVPN .   The tampered apps and their updates are pushed to users through the fraudulent website. It's also suspected that the targets are carefully selected, since launching the app requires the victim to enter an activation key to enable the features.  This implies the use of an undetermined distribution vector, although past evidence shows that it could take the form of spear-phishing em

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Android banking fraud malware known as SharkBot  has reared its head once again on the official Google Play Store, posing as file managers to bypass the app marketplace's restrictions.  A majority of the users who downloaded the rogue apps are located in the U.K. and Italy, Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender  said  in an analysis published this week.  SharkBot, first  discovered  towards the end of 2021 by Cleafy, is a  recurring   mobile   threat  distributed both on the Google Play Store and other third-party app stores.   One of the trojan's primary goals is to initiate money transfers from compromised devices via a technique called "Automatic Transfer System" ( ATS ), in which a transaction triggered via a banking app is intercepted to swap the payee account with an actor-controlled account in the background.  It's also capable of serving a fake login overlay when users attempt to open legitimate banking apps, stealing the credentials in the proce

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Companies based in the U.S. have been at the receiving end of an "aggressive" Qakbot malware campaign that leads to Black Basta ransomware infections on compromised networks.  "In this latest campaign, the Black Basta ransomware gang is using QakBot malware to create an initial point of entry and move laterally within an organization's network," Cybereason researchers Joakim Kandefelt and Danielle Frankel  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Black Basta, which emerged in April 2022, follows the tried-and-tested approach of double extortion to steal sensitive data from targeted companies and use it as leverage to extort cryptocurrency payments by threatening to release the stolen information.   This is not the first time the ransomware crew has been observed using Qakbot (aka QBot, QuackBot, or Pinkslipbot).

As many as 34 Russian-speaking gangs distributing information-stealing malware under the stealer-as-a-service model stole no fewer than 50 million passwords in the first seven months of 2022.  "The underground market value of stolen logs and compromised card details is estimated around $5.8 million," Singapore-headquartered Group-IB  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Aside from looting passwords, the stealers also harvested 2.11 billion cookie files, 113,204 crypto wallets, and 103,150 payment cards.  A majority of the victims are located in the U.S., followed by Brazil, India, Germany, Indonesia, the Philippines, France, Turkey, Vietnam, and Italy. In total, 890,000 devices in 111 countries were infected during the time frame.   Group-IB said the members of several scam groups who are propagating the information stealers previously participated in the  Classiscam  operation.

The operators of the Ducktail information stealer have demonstrated a "relentless willingness to persist" and continued to update their malware as part of an ongoing financially driven campaign.  "The malware is designed to steal browser cookies and take advantage of authenticated Facebook sessions to steal information from the victim's Facebook account," WithSecure researcher Mohammad Kazem Hassan Nejad  said  in a new analysis.  "The operation ultimately hijacks Facebook Business accounts to which the victim has sufficient access. The threat actor uses their gained access to run ads for monetary gain."   Attributed to a Vietnamese threat actor, the Ducktail campaign is designed to target businesses in the digital marketing and advertising sectors which are active on the Facebook Ads and Business platform.  Also targeted are individuals within prospective companies that are likely to have high-level access to Facebook Business accounts. This includes

Delivering a superior customer experience is essential for any e-commerce business. For those companies, there's a lot at stake this holiday season. According to Digital Commerce 360, nearly $1.00 of every $4.00 spent on retail purchases during the 2022 holiday season will be spent online, resulting in $224 billion in e-commerce sales. To ensure your e-commerce site is ready for the holiday rush, it's vital to ensure it is secure.   While safety and security are top priorities for businesses of all sizes, it is essential for those who operate in the e-commerce space. To deliver the experience customers crave, many websites embed third-party solutions at every stage of the customer journey. In fact, for certain e-commerce businesses, their suite of third-party plugins is how they create and sustain a competitive advantage.   Yet many e-commerce sites are inherently insecure and vulnerable to attack due to their reliance on untrustworthy third-party solutions.

Microsoft on Tuesday disclosed the intrusion activity aimed at Indian power grid entities earlier this year likely involved the exploitation of security flaws in a now-discontinued web server called Boa .  The tech behemoth's cybersecurity division  said  the vulnerable component poses a "supply chain risk that may affect millions of organizations and devices."  The findings build on a prior report  published  by Recorded Future in April 2022, which delved into a sustained campaign orchestrated by suspected China-linked adversaries to strike critical infrastructure organizations in India.  The cybersecurity firm attributed the attacks to a previously undocumented threat cluster called Threat Activity Group 38. While the Indian government described the attacks as unsuccessful "probing attempts," China denied it was behind the campaign.   The connections to China stem from the use of a modular backdoor dubbed  ShadowPad , which is known to be shared among several

The social media giant stated the individuals behind the activity impersonated the communities they targeted, propagating content in Arabic, Farsi, and Russian that floated themes of increased military cooperation with the U.S., and criticized Iran, China, and Russia.  These narratives spanned "Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China's treatment of the Uyghur people, Iran's influence in the Middle East, and the support of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan by Russia and China," Meta  said  in its Quarterly Adversaria

A nascent and legitimate penetration testing framework known as Nighthawk is likely to gain threat actors' attention for its Cobalt Strike-like capabilities.  Enterprise security firm Proofpoint said it detected the use of the software in mid-September 2022 with a number of test emails sent using generic subject lines such as "Just checking in" and "Hope this works2."  However, there are no indications that a leaked or cracked version of Nighthawk is being weaponized by threat actors in the wild, Proofpoint researcher Alexander Rausch  said  in a write-up.   Nighthawk, launched in December 2021 by a company called MDSec, is analogous to its counterparts  Cobalt Strike ,  Sliver , and  Brute Ratel , offering a red team toolset for adversary threat simulation. It's licensed for £7,500 (or $10,000) per user for a year.  "Nighthawk is the most advanced and evasive command-and-control framework available on the market," MDSec  notes . "Nighthawk i

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious extension for Chromium-based web browsers has been observed to be distributed via a long-standing Windows information stealer called ViperSoftX .  Czech-based cybersecurity company dubbed the rogue browser add-on VenomSoftX owing to its standalone features that enable it to access website visits, steal credentials and clipboard data, and even swap cryptocurrency addresses via an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attack.  ViperSoftX, which first  came to light  in February 2020, was characterized by  Fortinet  as a JavaScript-based remote access trojan and cryptocurrency stealer. The malware's use of a browser extension to advance its information-gathering goals was documented by Sophos threat analyst  Colin Cowie  earlier this year.   "This multi-stage stealer exhibits interesting hiding capabilities, concealed as small PowerShell scripts on a single line in the middle of otherwise innocent-looking large log files, among others," Avast researcher Jan Rubín  said

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A nascent Go-based malware known as Aurora Stealer is being increasingly deployed as part of campaigns designed to steal sensitive information from compromised hosts.  "These infection chains leveraged phishing pages impersonating download pages of legitimate software, including cryptocurrency wallets or remote access tools, and the 911 method making use of YouTube videos and SEO-poised fake cracked software download websites," cybersecurity firm SEKOIA  said .  First advertised on Russian cybercrime forums in April 2022, Aurora was offered as a commodity malware for other threat actors, describing it as a "multi-purpose botnet with stealing, downloading and remote access capabilities."   In the intervening months, the malware has been scaled down to a stealer that can harvest files of interest, data from 40 cryptocurrency wallets, and applications like Telegram.  Aurora also comes with a loader that can deploy a next-stage payloading using a PowerShell command.

The best line of defense against holiday hacking schemes is a comprehensive  incident response strategy  that focuses on end-user vulnerabilities.   The holiday season is upon us and with it a slew of cybersecurity scams preying on end-user vulnerabilities.  Because employees often use their business emails and cell phones as their primary point of contact, these scams quickly become a threat to employer computer systems. With so many people shopping online, tracking shipments, and entering sensitive data across multiple websites, holiday hackers are primed and ready to attack your networks by taking advantage of your employees' online actions and cell phone usage.  According to the FBI, the two most frequent types of  holiday scams  include non-delivery and non-payment crimes – when a consumer either pays for a product or service that is never delivered or products being shipped without the seller receiving payment. Cybercriminals are also keen on gift card fraud and auction fraud, a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Luna Moth campaign has extorted hundreds of thousands of dollars from several victims in the legal and retail sectors.  The attacks are notable for employing a technique called  callback phishing  or telephone-oriented attack delivery ( TOAD ), wherein the victims are social engineered into making a phone call through phishing emails containing invoices and subscription-themed lures.  Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said the attacks are the "product of a single highly organized campaign," adding, "this threat actor has significantly invested in call centers and infrastructure that's unique to each victim."  The cybersecurity firm  described  the activity as a "pervasive multi-month campaign that is actively evolving."   What's notable about callback phishing is that the email messages are completely devoid of any malicious attachment or booby-trapped link, allowing them to evade detection and slip past email protection solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) on Monday  announced  the takedown of seven domain names in connection to a "pig butchering" cryptocurrency scam. The fraudulent scheme, which operated from May to August 2022, netted the actors over $10 million from five victims, the DoJ said.  Pig butchering, also called Sha Zhu Pan, is a type of scam in which swindlers lure unsuspecting investors into sending their crypto assets. The criminals encounter potential victims on dating apps, social media sites, and SMS messages.  These individuals initiate fake relationships in an attempt to build trust, only to trick them into making a cryptocurrency investment on a bogus platform.   "Once the money is sent to the fake investment app, the scammer vanishes, taking all the money with them, often resulting in significant losses for the victim," the DoJ said.  The seven seized portals all mimicked the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX), the agency pointed out.  But once t

The cybercrime group called Daixin Team  has leaked sample data belonging to AirAsia, a Malaysian low-cost airline, on its data leak portal.  The development comes a little over a week after the company fell victim to a ransomware attack on November 11 and 12, per  DataBreaches.net .   The threat actors allegedly claim to have obtained the personal data associated with five million unique passengers and all of its employees.  The samples uploaded to the leak site reveal passenger information and the booking IDs as well as personal data related to the company's staff.   A spokesperson for the threat actor told DataBreaches.net that further attacks were not pursued owing to AirAsia's poor security measures and "the chaotic organization of the network."  Daixin Team was recently the subject of an  advisory  from the U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies, which warned of attacks mainly aimed at the healthcare sector.  Other victims of the criminal group include Fi

The notorious Emotet malware has returned with renewed vigor as part of a high-volume malspam campaign designed to drop payloads like  IcedID  and  Bumblebee .  "Hundreds of thousands of emails per day" have been sent since early November 2022, enterprise security company Proofpoint  said  last week, adding, "the new activity suggests Emotet is returning to its full functionality acting as a delivery network for major malware families."  Among the primary countries targeted are the U.S., the U.K., Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Mexico, and Brazil.  The Emotet-related activity was last observed in July 2022, although  sporadic   infections  have been  reported  since then. In mid-October, ESET  revealed  that Emotet may be readying for a new wave of attacks, pointing out updates to its "systeminfo" module.   The malware, which is attributed to a threat actor known as Mummy Spider (aka Gold Crestwood or TA542), staged a revival of sorts late last yea

As IT professionals, we all reach a certain point in our IT career where we realize that some of our everyday tasks are done the same way year after year without anyone questioning why it's done that way.  Despite the constant change and improvement in technology, some things just get done the same ineffective way without any real thought behind it because "that's the way it's always been done."  A typical example: patching  Month in, month out, a day comes along that is dedicated to patching.   Patching may be more automated than before because you no longer need to log into each system to patch and reboot tediously. It's a step forward, but the patching process remains the same.   Patching is disruptive, slow, error-prone, and rarely fast enough to keep up with new vulnerabilities. Why disruptive?

The defendants have also been asked to pay Google's attorney fees. The defendants' move to press sanctions against Google was denied.  The development comes nearly a year after the tech giant  took down  the malware's command-and-control infrastructure and initiated legal proceedings against Dmitry Starovikov  and Alexander Filippov , who are said to have been in charge of running the illegal botnet.   The defendants, along with 15 others, have also been accused of using the malware to create a hacked network of devices to mine cryptocurrencies, harvest victims' personal and financial data, and place disruptive ads.

Google Cloud last week disclosed that it identified 34 different hacked release versions of the Cobalt Strike tool in the wild, the earliest of which  shipped  in November 2012.  The versions, spanning 1.44 to 4.7, add up to a total of 275 unique JAR files, according to findings from the Google Cloud Threat Intelligence (GCTI) team. The  latest version  of Cobalt Strike is version 4.7.2.  Cobalt Strike, developed by  Fortra  (née HelpSystems), is a popular adversarial framework used by red teams to simulate attack scenarios and test the resilience of their cyber defenses.   It comprises a Team Server that acts as the command-and-control (C2) hub to remotely commandeer infected devices and a stager that's designed to deliver a next-stage payload called the Beacon, a fully-featured implant that reports back to the C2 server.   Given its wide-ranging suite of features, unauthorized versions of the software have been  increasingly   weaponized  by  many  a  threat   actor  to  advance

The Indian government on Friday released a draft version of the much-awaited data protection regulation, making it the fourth such effort since it was first proposed in July 2018.

The draft is open for public consultation until December 17, 2022.  India has over 760 million active internet users, necessitating that data generated and used by online platforms are subject to privacy rules to prevent abuse and increase accountability and trust.

A developing threat activity cluster has been found using Google Ads in one of its campaigns to distribute various post-compromise payloads, including the recently discovered  Royal ransomware .  Microsoft, which spotted the updated malware delivery method in late October 2022, is tracking the group under the name  DEV-0569 .  "Observed DEV-0569 attacks show a pattern of continuous innovation, with regular incorporation of new discovery techniques, defense evasion, and various post-compromise payloads, alongside increasing ransomware facilitation," the Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence team  said  in an analysis.  The threat actor is known to rely on malvertising to point unsuspecting victims to malware downloader links that pose as software installers for legitimate apps like Adobe Flash Player, AnyDesk, LogMeIn, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom.   The malware downloader, a strain referred to as  BATLOADER , is a dropper that functions as a conduit to distribute next-stage pa

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A notorious advanced persistent threat actor known as  Mustang Panda  has been linked to a spate of spear-phishing attacks targeting government, education, and research sectors across the world.  The primary targets of the intrusions from May to October 2022 included counties in the Asia Pacific region such as Myanmar, Australia, the Philippines, Japan, and Taiwan, cybersecurity firm Trend Micro  said  in a Friday report.   Mustang Panda, also called Bronze President, Earth Preta, HoneyMyte, and Red Lich, is a China-based espionage actor believed to be active since at least July 2018. The group is known for its use of malware such as China Chopper and PlugX to collect data from compromised environments.   Activities of the group chronicled by  ESET ,  Google, Proofpoint ,  Cisco Talos , and  Secureworks  this year have revealed the threat actor's pattern of using PlugX (and its variant called Hodur) to infect a wide range of entities in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Ameri

Atlassian Releases Patches for Critical Flaws Affecting Crowd and Bitbucket Products<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/atlassian-releases-patches-for-critical.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Australian software company Atlassian has rolled out security updates to address  two critical flaws  affecting Bitbucket Server, Data Center, and Crowd products.  The issues, tracked as  CVE-2022-43781  and  CVE-2022-43782 , are both rated 9 out of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system.  CVE-2022-43781, which Atlassian said was introduced in version 7.0.0 of Bitbucket Server and Data Center, affects versions 7.0 to 7.21 and 8.0 to 8.4 (only if mesh.enabled is set to false in bitbucket.properties).   The weakness has been described as a case of command injection using environment variables in the software, which could allow an adversary with permission to control their username to gain code execution on the affected system.  As a temporary workaround, the company is recommending users turn off the "Public Signup" option (Administration > Authentication).  "Disabling public signup would change the attack vector from an unauthenticated attack to an authenticated

Included among those fired were contractors who worked as security guards at the social media firm's facilities and were given access to an internal tool that allowed employees to help "users they know" gain access to accounts after forgetting their passwords, or had their accounts locked out.   The system, called "Oops" and short for Online Operations, is off limits to a vast majority of the platform's users, leading to the rise of a "cottage industry of intermediaries" who charge users thousands of dollars and reach out to insiders who are willing to reset the accounts.  "You really have to have someone on the inside who will actually do it

The LodaRAT malware has resurfaced with new variants that are being deployed in conjunction with other sophisticated malware, such as RedLine Stealer and Neshta.  "The ease of access to its source code makes LodaRAT an attractive tool for any threat actor who is interested in its capabilities," Cisco Talos researcher Chris Neal  said  in a write-up published Thursday.  Aside from being dropped alongside other malware families, LodaRAT has also been observed being delivered through a previously unknown variant of another commodity trojan called  Venom RAT , which has been codenamed S500.   An AutoIT-based malware, LodaRAT (aka  Nymeria ) is attributed to a group called Kasablanca and is capable of harvesting sensitive information from compromised machines.  In February 2021, an  Android version  of the malware sprang forth as a way for the threat actors to expand their attack surface. Then in September 2022, Zscaler ThreatLabz uncovered a new delivery mechanism that involved

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat hunting is the process of looking for malicious activity and its artifacts in a computer system or network. Threat hunting is carried out intermittently in an environment regardless of whether or not threats have been discovered by automated security solutions. Some threat actors may stay dormant in an organization's infrastructure, extending their access while waiting for the right opportunity to exploit discovered weaknesses.  Therefore it is important to perform threat hunting to identify malicious actors in an environment and stop them before they achieve their ultimate goal.   To effectively perform threat hunting, the threat hunter must have a systematic approach to emulating possible adversary behavior. This adversarial behavior determines what artifacts can be searched for that indicate ongoing or past malicious activity.

The threat actors behind the Hive ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) scheme have launched attacks against over 1,300 companies across the world, netting the gang $100 million in illicit payments as of November 2022.  "Hive ransomware has targeted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure sectors, including government facilities, communications, critical manufacturing, information technology, and — especially — Healthcare and Public Health (HPH)," U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence authorities  said  in an alert.  Active since June 2021, Hive's RaaS operation involves a mix of developers, who create and manage the malware, and affiliates, who are responsible for conducting the attacks on target networks by often purchasing initial access from initial access brokers (IABs).   In most cases, gaining a foothold involves the exploitation of  ProxyShell flaws  in Microsoft Exchange Server, followed by taking steps to terminate processes associated with antivirus engi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing supply chain attack has been leveraging malicious Python packages to distribute malware called W4SP Stealer, with over hundreds of victims ensnared to date.  "The threat actor is still active and is releasing more malicious packages," Checkmarx researcher Jossef Harush  said  in a technical write-up, calling the adversary  WASP . "The attack seems related to cybercrime as the attacker claims that these tools are undetectable to increase sales."  The findings from Checkmarx build on recent reports from  Phylum  and  Check Point , which flagged 30 different modules published on the Python Package Index (PyPI) that were designed to propagate malicious code under the guise of benign-looking packages.   The attack is just the latest threat to target the software supply chain. What makes it notable is the use of steganography to extract a  polymorphic malware  payload hidden within an image file hosted on Imgur.   The installation of the package ultimately mak

A China-based financially motivated group is leveraging the trust associated with popular international brands to orchestrate a large-scale phishing campaign dating back as far as 2019.  The threat actor, dubbed Fangxiao by Cyjax, is said to have registered over  42,000 imposter domains , with initial activity observed in 2017.  "It targets businesses in multiple verticals including retail, banking, travel, and energy," researchers Emily Dennison and Alana Witten  said . "Promised financial or physical incentives are used to trick victims into further spreading the campaign via WhatsApp."  Users clicking on a link sent through the messaging app are directed to an actor-controlled site, which, in turn, sends them to a landing domain impersonating a well-known brand, from where the victims are once again taken to sites distributing fraudulent apps and bogus rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Iranian government-sponsored threat actors have been blamed for compromising a U.S. federal agency by taking advantage of the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server.  The details, which were shared by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), come in response to incident response efforts undertaken by the authority from mid-June through mid-July 2022.  "Cyber threat actors exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server, installed XMRig crypto mining software, moved laterally to the domain controller (DC), compromised credentials, and then implanted Ngrok reverse proxies on several hosts to maintain persistence," CISA  noted .  LogShell, aka  CVE-2021-44228 , is a critical remote code execution flaw in the widely-used Apache Log4j Java-based logging library. It was addressed by the open source project maintainers in December 2021.   The latest development  marks  the  continued   abuse  of the Log4j v

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Hackers tied to the North Korean government have been observed using an updated version of a backdoor known as Dtrack targeting a wide range of industries in Germany, Brazil, India, Italy, Mexico, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the U.S.  "Dtrack allows criminals to upload, download, start or delete files on the victim host," Kaspersky researchers Konstantin Zykov and Jornt van der Wiel  said  in a report.  The victimology patterns indicate an expansion to Europe and Latin America. Sectors targeted by the malware are education, chemical manufacturing, governmental research centers and policy institutes, IT service providers, utility providers, and telecommunication firms.   Dtrack, also called Valefor and Preft, is the handiwork of Andariel, a subgroup of the  Lazarus nation-state threat actor  that's publicly tracked by the broader cybersecurity community using the monikers Operation Troy, Silent Chollima, and Stonefly.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Hundreds of databases on Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) are exposing personal identifiable information (PII), new findings from Mitiga, a cloud incident response company, show.  "Leaking PII in this manner provides a potential treasure trove for threat actors – either during the reconnaissance phase of the cyber kill chain or extortionware/ransomware campaigns," researchers Ariel Szarf, Doron Karmi, and Lionel Saposnik said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.  This includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, marital status, car rental information, and even company logins.   Amazon RDS is a  web service  that makes it possible to set up relational databases in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It offers support for different database engines such as MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.  The root cause of the leaks stems from a feature called public  RDS snapshots , which allows for creating a backup of the entire da

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
According to a  recent survey , 90% of CISOs running teams in small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) use a managed detection and response (MDR) service. That's a 53% increase from last year.  Why the dramatic shift to MDR?  CISOs at organizations of any size, but especially SMEs, are realizing that the threat landscape and the way we do cybersecurity are among the many things that will never look the same in a post-2020 world.   The increase in the number of sophisticated attacks, the heavy reliance on the cloud, limited resources and budgets (exacerbated by economic uncertainty), and a growing skills gap are all major contributors to why having an MDR service to support security operations is becoming a necessity.   Beyond that, there are a number of reasons for why incorporating an MDR service into your security strategy can provide exceptional value that even the people who are tightening your budget at your organization can't deny.   Here are just seven reasons why you (yes, you

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed new samples of malware called RapperBot that are being used to build a botnet capable of launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against game servers.  "In fact, it turns out that this campaign is less like RapperBot than an older campaign that appeared in February and then mysteriously disappeared in the middle of April," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researchers Joie Salvio and Roy Tay  said  in a Tuesday report.  RapperBot, which was first  documented  by the network security firm in August 2022, is known to exclusively brute-force SSH servers configured to accept  password authentication .   The nascent malware is heavily inspired by the  Mirai botnet , whose source code leaked in October 2016, leading to the rise of several variants.  What's notable about the updated version of RapperBot is its ability to perform Telnet brute-force, in addition to supporting DoS attacks using the Generic Routing Encapsulation ( GRE

Google to Roll Out Privacy Sandbox Beta on Android 13 by Early 2023<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/google-to-roll-out-privacy-sandbox-beta.html"> Full Text</a>

Internet behemoth Google on Tuesday said it plans to roll out Privacy Sandbox for Android in beta to mobile devices running Android 13 starting early next year.  "The Privacy Sandbox Beta will be available for ad tech and app developers who wish to test the ads-related APIs as part of their solutions," the company  said .  To that end, developers will need to complete an enrollment process in order to utilize the ads-related APIs, including  Topics ,  FLEDGE , and  Attribution Reporting .   Topics, which  replaced  Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) earlier this year, aims to categorize user interests under different "topics" based on their device web browsing history. These inferred interests are then shared with marketers to serve targeted ads.  FLEDGE and Attribution reporting, on the other hand, enable custom audience targeting and help measure  ad conversions  without relying on cross-party user identifiers, respectively.  Organizations can also request acce

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Spotify's Backstage has been discovered as vulnerable to a severe security flaw that could be exploited to gain remote code execution by leveraging a recently disclosed bug in a third-party module.  The vulnerability (CVSS score: 9.8), at its core, takes advantage of a critical sandbox escape in vm2, a popular JavaScript sandbox library ( CVE-2022-36067  aka Sandbreak), that came to light last month.  "An unauthenticated threat actor can execute arbitrary system commands on a Backstage application by exploiting a vm2 sandbox escape in the Scaffolder core plugin," application security firm Oxeye said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.   Backstage  is an open source  developer portal  from Spotify that allows users to create, manage, and explore software components from a unified " front door ." It's used by  many companies  like Netflix, DoorDash, Roku, and Expedia, among others.  According to Oxeye, the flaw is rooted in a tool called  software templ

Credit: Marina Minkin  A novel attack method has been disclosed against a crucial piece of technology called time-triggered ethernet ( TTE ) that's used in safety-critical infrastructure, potentially causing the failure of systems powering spacecraft and aircraft.  Dubbed  PCspooF  by a group of academics and researchers from the University of Michigan , the University of Pennsylvania, and the NASA Johnson Space Center, the  technique  is designed to break TTE's security guarantees and induce TTE devices to lose synchronization for up to a second, a behavior that can even lead to uncontrolled maneuvers in spaceflight missions and threaten crew safety.  TTE  is one among the networking technologies that's part of what's called a mixed-criticality network wherein traffic with different timing and faults tolerance requirements coexist in the same physical network. This means that both critical devices, which, say, enable vehicle control, and non-critical devices, which are

The cybersecurity firm said there was no evidence to suggest that the issues were actively exploited in real-world attacks. No action is required on the part of the customers.   Zendesk Explore is a  reporting and analytics solution  that allows organizations to "view and analyze key information about your customers, and your support resources."

Deep Packet Inspection vs. Metadata Analysis of Network Detection & Response (NDR) Solutions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/deep-packet-inspection-vs-metadata.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Today, most Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions rely on traffic mirroring and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). Traffic mirroring is typically deployed on a single-core switch to provide a copy of the network traffic to a sensor that uses DPI to thoroughly analyze the payload. While this approach provides detailed analysis, it requires large amounts of processing power and is blind when it comes to encrypted network traffic. Metadata Analysis has been specifically developed to overcome these limitations. By utilizing metadata for analysis, network communications can be observed at any collection point and be enriched by the information providing insights about encrypted communication.  Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions have become crucial to reliably monitor and protect network operations. However, as network traffic becomes encrypted and data volumes continue to increase, most traditional NDR solutions are reaching their limits. This begs the question: What detect

Researchers Say China State-backed Hackers Breached a Digital Certificate Authority<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/researchers-say-china-state-backed.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected Chinese state-sponsored actor breached a digital certificate authority as well as government and defense agencies located in different countries in Asia as part of an ongoing campaign since at least March 2022.  Symantec, by Broadcom Software, linked the attacks to an adversarial group it tracks under the name  Billbug , citing the use of tools previously attributed to this actor. The activity appears to be driven by espionage and data-theft, although no data is said to have been stolen to date.  Billbug , also called Bronze Elgin, Lotus Blossom, Lotus Panda,  Spring Dragon , and  Thrip , is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that is believed to operate on behalf of Chinese interests. Primary targets include government and military organizations in South East Asia.   Attacks mounted by the adversary in 2019 involved the use of backdoors like  Hannotog and Sagerunex , with the intrusions observed in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.

Internet giant Google has agreed to pay a record $391.5 million to settle with 40 states in the U.S. over charges the company misled users about the collection of personal location data.  "Google misled its users into thinking they had turned off location tracking in their account settings, when, in fact, Google continued to collect their location information," Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum  said  Monday.  "For years Google has prioritized profit over their users' privacy. They have been crafty and deceptive," Rosenblum stated.  The investigation was sparked by a  2018 report  from the Associated Press that revealed Google was continuing to track users' locations on Android and iOS even when they turned off "location history" in their account settings, effectively undermining the privacy controls.   Rosenblum said the location data gathered by Google is combined with other personal and behavioral information it collects to flesh out deta

Entities located in East and Southeast Asia as well as Ukraine have been targeted at least since 2020 by a previously undocumented subgroup of  APT41 , a prolific Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT).  Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro, which  christened  the espionage crew  Earth Longzhi , said the actor's long-running campaign can be split into two based on the toolset deployed to attack its victims.  The first wave from May 2020 to February 2021 is said to have targeted government, infrastructure, and healthcare industries in Taiwan and the banking sector in China, whereas the succeeding set of intrusions from August 2021 to June 2022 infiltrated high-profile victims in Ukraine and several countries in Asia.   This included defense, aviation, insurance, and urban development industries in Taiwan, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ukraine.  The victimology patterns and the targeted sectors overlap with attacks mounted by a distinct sister group of  APT41  (aka

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malicious campaign has compromised  over 15,000 WordPress websites  in an attempt to redirect visitors to bogus Q&A portals.  "These malicious redirects appear to be designed to increase the authority of the attacker's sites for search engines," Sucuri researcher Ben Martin  said  in a report published last week, calling it a "clever black hat SEO trick."  The search engine poisoning technique is designed to promote a "handful of fake low quality Q&A sites" that share similar website-building templates and are operated by the same threat actor.   A notable aspect of the campaign is the ability of the hackers to modify over 100 files per website on average, an approach that contrasts dramatically from other attacks of this kind wherein only a limited number of files are tampered with to reduce footprint and escape detection.  Some of the most commonly infected pages consist of wp-signup.php, wp-cron.php, wp-links-opml.php, wp-settings.php

A penetration test (also known as a pentest) is a security assessment that simulates the activities of real-world attackers to identify security holes in your IT systems or applications.   The aim of the test is to understand what vulnerabilities you have, how they could be exploited, and what the impact would be if an attacker was successful.  Usually performed first, an external pentest (also known as external network penetration testing) is an assessment of your perimeter systems. Your perimeter is all the systems that are directly reachable from the internet. By definition, they are exposed and are, therefore the most easily and regularly attacked.  Testing for weaknesses  External pentests look for ways to compromise these external, accessible systems and services to access sensitive information and see how an attacker could target your clients, customers or users.   In a high-quality external pentest, the security professional(s) will copy the activities of real hackers, like ex

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly discovered evasive malware leverages the Secure Shell ( SSH ) cryptographic protocol to gain entry into targeted systems with the goal of mining cryptocurrency and carrying out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.  Dubbed  KmsdBot  by the Akamai Security Intelligence Response Team (SIRT), the Golang-based malware has been found targeting a variety of companies ranging from gaming to luxury car brands to security firms.  "The botnet infects systems via an SSH connection that uses weak login credentials," Akamai researcher Larry W. Cashdollar  said . "The malware does not stay persistent on the infected system as a way of evading detection."   The malware gets its name from an executable named "kmsd.exe" that's downloaded from a remote server following a successful compromise. It's also designed to support multiple architectures, such as Winx86, Arm64, mips64, and x86_64.  KmsdBot comes with capabilities to perform scanning operatio

Worok Hackers Abuse Dropbox API to Exfiltrate Data via Backdoor Hidden in Images<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/worok-hackers-abuse-dropbox-api-to.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recently discovered cyber espionage group dubbed  Worok  has been found hiding malware in seemingly innocuous image files, corroborating a crucial link in the threat actor's infection chain.  Czech cybersecurity firm Avast said the purpose of the PNG files is to conceal a payload that's used to facilitate information theft.  "What is noteworthy is data collection from victims' machines using Dropbox repository, as well as attackers using Dropbox API for communication with the final stage," the company  said .  The development comes a little over two months after ESET disclosed details of attacks carried out by  Worok  against high-profile companies and local governments located in Asia and Africa. Worok is believed to share tactical overlaps with a Chinese threat actor tracked as  TA428 .   The Slovak cybersecurity company also documented Worok's compromise sequence, which makes use of a C++-based loader called CLRLoad  to pave the way for an unknown PowerS

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two long-running surveillance campaigns have been found targeting the Uyghur community in China and elsewhere with Android spyware tools designed to harvest sensitive information and track their whereabouts.  This encompasses a previously undocumented malware strain called BadBazaar and updated variants of an espionage artifact dubbed  MOONSHINE  by researchers from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in September 2019.  "Mobile surveillance tools like BadBazaar and MOONSHINE can be used to track many of the 'pre-criminal' activities, actions considered indicative of religious extremism or separatism by the authorities in Xinjiang," Lookout  said  in a detailed write-up of the operations.  The BadBazaar campaign, according to the security firm, is said to date as far back as late 2018 and comprise 111 unique apps that masquerade as benign video players, messengers, religious apps, and even TikTok.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has removed two new malicious dropper apps that have been detected on the Play Store for Android, one of which posed as a lifestyle app and was caught distributing the Xenomorph banking malware.  "Xenomorph is a trojan that steals credentials from banking applications on users' devices," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Himanshu Sharma and Viral Gandhi  said  in an analysis published Thursday.  "It is also capable of intercepting users' SMS messages and notifications, enabling it to steal one-time passwords and multi-factor authentication requests."   The cybersecurity firm said it also found an expense tracker app that exhibited similar behavior, but noted that it couldn't extract the URL used to fetch the malware artifact.   The two malicious apps are as follows -   Todo: Day manager (com.todo.daymanager)  経費キーパー (com.setprice.expenses)   Both the apps function as a dropper, meaning the apps themselves are harmless and are a conduit to retrieve t

When you are trying to get another layer of cyber protection that would not require a lot of resources, you are most likely choosing between a VPN service & a DNS Security solution. Let's discuss both.   VPN Explained  VPN stands for Virtual Private Networks and basically hides your IP and provides an encrypted server by redirecting your traffic via a server run by a VPN host. It establishes a protected connection in public networks. It does protect your actions from being seen by your ISP and potential hackers, however, it does not provide full protection and can still let intrusions happen.   Worth noting, VPN does gain access to restricted resources in your region, but bear in mind, it might be collecting your personal data. This problem relates mostly to free and cheap VPN services. In addition to that, VPNs, depending on their type, can proxy requests or not.  Most of the free ones do not even encrypt your data.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple high-severity flaws have been uncovered in the open source OpenLiteSpeed Web Server as well as its enterprise variant that could be weaponized to achieve remote code execution.  "By chaining and exploiting the vulnerabilities, adversaries could compromise the web server and gain fully privileged remote code execution," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42  said  in a Thursday report.   OpenLiteSpeed , the open source edition of LiteSpeed Web Server, is the sixth most popular web server, accounting for 1.9 million unique servers across the world.  The first of the three flaws is a directory traversal flaw ( CVE-2022-0072 , CVSS score: 5.8), which could be exploited to access forbidden files in the web root directory.   The remaining two vulnerabilities ( CVE-2022-0073  and  CVE-2022-0074 , CVSS scores: 8.8) relate to a case of privilege escalation and command injection, respectively, that could be chained to achieve privileged code execution.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has announced charges against a dual Russian and Canadian national for his alleged participation in  LockBit ransomware attacks  across the world.  The 33-year-old Ontario resident,  Mikhail Vasiliev , has been taken into custody and is awaiting extradition to the U.S., where is likely to be sentenced for a maximum of five years in prison.  Vasiliev has been charged with conspiracy to intentionally damage protected computers and to transmit ransom demands, according to a  criminal complaint  filed in the District of New Jersey.   A search of the defendant's home in August and October 2022 by Canadian law enforcement unearthed a file stored on a device containing what's suspected to be a list of "prospective or historical" victims as well as screenshots of communications exchanged with "LockBitSupp" on the Tox messaging platform.

Microsoft on Thursday attributed the recent spate of ransomware incidents targeting transportation and logistics sectors in Ukraine and Poland to a threat cluster that shares overlaps with the Russian state-sponsored  Sandworm group .  The attacks, which were disclosed by the tech giant last month, involved a strain of previously undocumented malware called  Prestige  and is said to have taken place within an hour of each other across all victims.  The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) is now tracking the threat actor under its element-themed moniker Iridium (née DEV-0960), citing overlaps with Sandworm (aka Iron Viking, TeleBots, and Voodoo Bear).  "This attribution assessment is based on forensic artifacts, as well as overlaps in victimology, tradecraft, capabilities, and infrastructure, with known Iridium activity," MSTIC  said  in an update.

Warning: New Massive Malicious Campaigns Targeting Top Indian Banks' Customers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/warning-this-widespread-malicious.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are warning of "massive phishing campaigns" that distribute five different malware targeting banking users in India.  "The bank customers targeted include account subscribers of seven banks, including some of the most well-known banks located in the country and potentially affecting millions of customers," Trend Micro  said  in a report published this week.  Some of the targeted banks include Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, and the State Bank of India (SBI), among others.  The infection chains all have a common entry point in that they rely on SMS messages containing a phishing link that urge potential victims to enter their personal details and credit card information to supposedly get a tax refund or gain credit card reward points.   The smishing attacks, which deliver Elibomi, FakeReward, AxBanker, IcRAT, and IcSpy, are just the latest in a series of similar rewards-themed malware campaigns that have been documented by  Microsoft, Cyble , and  K

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has resolved a high-severity security issue affecting all Pixel smartphones that could be trivially exploited to unlock the devices.  The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2022-20465  and reported by security researcher David Schütz in June 2022, was remediated as part of the search giant's  monthly Android update  for November 2022.  "The issue allowed an attacker with physical access to bypass the lock screen protections (fingerprint, PIN, etc.) and gain complete access to the user's device," Schütz, who was awarded $70,000 for the lock screen bypass,  said  in a write-up of the flaw.   The problem, per the researcher, is rooted in the fact that lock screen protections are completely defeated when following a specific sequence of steps -   Supply incorrect fingerprint three times to disable biometric authentication on the locked device  Hot swap  the SIM card in the device with an attacker-controlled SIM that has a PIN code set up  Enter incorrect SIM pin thric

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious package discovered on the Python Package Index (PyPI) has been found employing a steganographic trick to conceal malicious code within image files.  The package in question, named " apicolor ," was uploaded to the Python third-party repository on October 31, 2022, and described as a "Core lib for REST API," according to Israeli cybersecurity firm  Check Point . It has since been  taken down .   Apicolor, like other  rogue packages  detected recently, harbors its malicious behavior in the setup script used to specify metadata associated with the package, such as its dependencies.  This takes the form of a second package called "judyb" as well as a seemingly harmless PNG file ("8F4D2uF.png") hosted on Imgur, an image-sharing service.   "The judyb code turned out to be a steganography module, responsible [for] hiding and revealing hidden messages inside pictures," Check Point explained.  The attack chain entails using the judy

Professionals, by joining the cyber workforce.  Cyber industry partners, as part of the cybersecurity solution.   CISA outlined four "things you can do" to stay safe online for individuals and families, including updating their software, thinking before they click, using strong passwords, and enabling multifactor authentication on sensitive accounts.  The industry has been teaching security tips to employees and the public for a long time. With so much repetitive media and education on cyber awareness in the rearview mirror, the returning October focus weighs on many.

The rise in the costs of data breaches, ransomware, and other cyber attacks leads to rising cyber insurance premiums and more limited cyber insurance coverage. This cyber insurance situation increases risks for organizations struggling to find coverage or facing steep increases.  Some  Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP's  law firm clients, for example, reported a three-fold increase in insurance rates, and carriers are making "a huge pullback" on coverage limits in the past two years. Their cybersecurity practice co-head, Michelle Reed, adds, "The reduced coverage amount can no longer shield policyholders from cyber losses. A $10 million policy can end up with a $150,000 limit on cyber frauds."  The cyber-insurance situation is so concerning that the U.S. Treasury Department recently issued a  request for public input  on a potential federal cyber-insurance response program. This request is in addition to the assessment led conjointly by the Federal Insura

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Russia-linked APT29 nation-state actor has been found leveraging a "lesser-known" Windows feature called Credential Roaming as part of its attack against an unnamed European diplomatic entity.  "The diplomatic-centric targeting is consistent with Russian strategic priorities as well as historic APT29 targeting," Mandiant researcher Thibault Van Geluwe de Berlaere  said  in a technical write-up.  APT29, a Russian espionage group also called Cozy Bear, Iron Hemlock, and The Dukes, is  known  for its intrusions aimed at collecting intelligence that align with the country's strategic objectives. It's believed to be sponsored by the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).   Some of the adversarial collective's cyber activities are tracked publicly under the moniker  Nobelium , a threat cluster responsible for the widespread supply chain compromise through SolarWinds software in December 2020.

Several Cyber Attacks Observed Leveraging IPFS Decentralized Network<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/several-cyber-attacks-observed.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A number of phishing campaigns are leveraging the decentralized Interplanetary Filesystem (IPFS) network to host malware, phishing kit infrastructure, and facilitate other attacks.  "Multiple malware families are currently being hosted within IPFS and retrieved during the initial stages of malware attacks," Cisco Talos researcher Edmund Brumaghin said in an analysis  shared with The Hacker News.  The research mirrors similar findings from Trustwave SpiderLabs in July 2022, which  found  more than 3,000 emails containing IPFS phishing URLs as an attack vector, calling IPFS the new "hotbed" for hosting phishing sites.  IPFS as a technology is both resilient to censorship and takedowns, making it a double-edged sword. Underlying it is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network which replicates content across all participating nodes so that even if content is removed from one machine, requests for the resources can still be served via other systems.   This also makes it ripe for abu

The Keksec threat actor has been linked to a previously undocumented malware strain, which has been observed in the wild masquerading as an extension for Chromium-based web browsers to enslave compromised machines into a botnet.  Called  Cloud9  by security firm Zimperium, the malicious browser add-on comes with a wide range of features that enables it to siphon cookies, log keystrokes, inject arbitrary JavaScript code, mine crypto, and even enlist the host to carry out DDoS attacks.  The extension "not only steals the information available during the browser session but can also install malware on a user's device and subsequently assume control of the entire device," Zimperium researcher Nipun Gupta  said  in a new report.  The JavaScript botnet isn't distributed via Chrome Web Store or Microsoft Edge Add-ons, but rather through fake executables and rogue websites disguised as Adobe Flash Player updates.  Once installed, the extension is designed to inject a JavaScr

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An updated version of a malware loader codenamed  IceXLoader  is suspected of having compromised thousands of personal and enterprise Windows machines across the world.  IceXLoader is a commodity malware that's sold for $118 on underground forums for a lifetime license. It's chiefly employed to download and execute additional malware on breached hosts.  This past June, Fortinet FortiGuard Labs said it  uncovered  a version of the trojan written in the Nim programming language with the goal of evading analysis and detection.   "While the version discovered in June (v3.0) looked like a work-in-progress, we recently observed a newer v3.3.3 loader which looks to be fully functionable and includes a multi-stage delivery chain," Natalie Zargarov, cybersecurity researcher at Minerva Labs,  said  in a report published Tuesday.  IceXLoader is traditionally distributed through phishing campaigns, with emails containing ZIP archives functioning as a trigger to deploy the malwar

Microsoft's latest round of monthly security updates has been released with fixes for  68 vulnerabilities  spanning its software portfolio, including patches for six actively exploited zero-days.  12 of the issues are rated Critical, two are rated High, and 55 are rated Important in severity. This also includes the weaknesses that were closed out by  OpenSSL  the previous week.  Also separately  addressed  at the start of the month is an actively exploited flaw in Chromium-based browsers ( CVE-2022-3723 ) that was plugged by Google as part of an out-of-band update late last month.  "The big news is that  two older zero-day CVEs  affecting Exchange Server, made public at the end of September, have finally been fixed," Greg Wiseman, product manager at Rapid7, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.   "Customers are advised to update their  Exchange Server systems  immediately, regardless of whether any previously recommended mitigation steps have been applied

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Amadey malware is being used to deploy  LockBit 3.0 ransomware  on compromised systems, researchers have warned.  "Amadey bot, the malware that is used to install LockBit, is being distributed through two methods: one using a malicious Word document file, and the other using an executable that takes the disguise of the Word file icon," AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)  said  in a new report published today.  Amadey, first discovered in 2018, is a "criminal-to-criminal (C2C) botnet infostealer project," as  described  by the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team, and is offered for purchase on the criminal underground for as much as $600.   While its primary function is to harvest sensitive information from the infected hosts, it further doubles up as a channel to deliver next-stage artifacts. Earlier this July, it was  spread using SmokeLoader , a malware with not-so-different features like itself.  Just last month, ASEC also  found  the mal

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cryptocurrency users are being targeted with a new clipper malware strain dubbed  Laplas  by means of another malware known as SmokeLoader.  SmokeLoader, which is delivered by means of weaponized documents sent through spear-phishing emails, further acts as a conduit for other  commodity trojans  like  SystemBC  and  Raccoon Stealer 2.0 , according to an  analysis  from Cyble.   Observed in the wild since circa 2013,  SmokeLoader  functions as a generic loader capable of distributing additional payloads onto compromised systems, such as information-stealing malware and other implants. In July 2022, it was found to deploy a backdoor called  Amadey .  Cyble said it discovered over 180 samples of the Laplas since October 24, 2022, suggesting a wide deployment.   Clippers, also called ClipBankers, fall under a category of malware that Microsoft calls  cryware , which are designed to steal crypto by keeping close tabs on a victim's clipboard activity and swapping the original wallet ad

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Monday said it seized 50,676 Bitcoin in November 2021 that was stolen in the 2012 hack of the now-defunct Silk Road dark web marketplace.  The bitcoin, which was obtained in 2012 and valued at $3.36 billion when it was discovered last year, is now worth $1.04 billion. Additionally recovered were $661,900 in cash, 25 Casascius coins with an approximate value of 174 Bitcoin, and gold- and silver-colored bars.  It's also one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures to date, followed by the confiscation of $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin  earlier this February  tied to the 2016 breach of the Bitfinex crypto exchange.   The Justice Department said it conducted the seizure on November 9, 2021, pursuant to a search warrant issued to James Zhong's house located in the U.S. state of Georgia. It also said the keys to the tokens were found in an underground floor safe and on a "single-board computer that was submerged under blankets in a popcorn t

The news surrounding the slowing economy has many wondering how much of an impact it will have on their businesses – and lives. And there's good reason to start preparing.   A recent survey by McKinsey & Company found that 85% of small and midsize businesses plan to increase their security spending heading into 2023, while Gartner recently projected that 2022 IT spending will only grow by 3%, down from a 10% growth rate the year before.  We're already seeing businesses making cuts and freezing budgets. And smaller organizations that already have limited budgets are more vulnerable than ever. While we are still dealing with the unknown, one thing  is  clear: even as the economy slows down, security threats don't.  But there's hope.   A  new eBook  illuminates how one solution can not only help increase security operations efficiency but also provide economic safeguards for security teams that are already strapped for cash.   What is the solution? Consolidation.  If

Australian health insurer Medibank today confirmed that personal data belonging to around 9.7 million of its current and former customers were accessed following a ransomware incident.  The  attack , according to the company, was detected in its IT network on October 12 in a manner that it said was "consistent with the precursors to a ransomware event," prompting it to isolate its systems, but not before the attackers exfiltrated the data.  "This figure represents around 5.1 million Medibank customers, around 2.8 million ahm customers, and around 1.8 million international customers," Medibank  noted .   Compromised details include names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses, as well as Medicare numbers (but not expiry dates) for ahm customers, and passport numbers (but not expiry dates) and visa details for international student customers.  It further said the incident resulted in the theft of health claims data for about 160,000 Medibank c

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Facebook appears to have silently rolled out a tool that allows users to remove their contact information, such as phone numbers and email addresses, uploaded by others.  The existence of the  tool , which is buried inside a  Help Center page  about " Friending ," was first reported by  Business Insider  last week. It's offered as a way for "Non-users" to "exercise their rights under applicable laws."   An Internet Archive search via the Wayback Machine  shows  that the option has been available since at least May 29, 2022.  When users  sync the contact lists  on their devices with Facebook (or any other service), it's worth pointing out the  privacy violation , which stems from the fact that those contacts didn't explicitly consent to the upload.  "Someone may have uploaded their address book to Facebook, Messenger or Instagram with your contact information in it," Facebook notes in the page. "You can ask us to confirm whether

Security researchers are warning of "a trove of sensitive information" leaking through urlscan.io, a website scanner for suspicious and malicious URLs.

The Berlin-based cybersecurity firm said it started an investigation in the aftermath of a  notification  sent by GitHub in February 2022 to an unknown number of users about sharing their usernames and private repository names (i.e.,  GitHub Pages URLs ) to urlscan.io for metadata analysis as part of an automated process.   Urlscan.io, which has been described as a  sandbox for the web , is  integrated  into several security solutions  via its API .

A phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform known as  Robin Banks  has relocated its attack infrastructure to DDoS-Guard, a Russian provider of bulletproof hosting services.  The switch comes after "Cloudflare disassociated Robin Banks phishing infrastructure from its services, causing a multi-day disruption to operations," according to a  report  from cybersecurity company IronNet.  Robin Banks was  first documented  in July 2022 when the platform's abilities to offer ready-made phishing kits to criminal actors were revealed, making it possible to steal the financial information of customers of popular banks and other online services.  It was also found to prompt users to enter Google and Microsoft credentials on rogue landing pages, suggesting an attempt on part of the malware authors to monetize initial access to corporate networks for post-exploitation activities such as espionage and ransomware.

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered 29 packages in Python Package Index (PyPI), the official third-party software repository for the Python programming language, that aim to infect developers' machines with a malware called W4SP Stealer .  "The main attack seems to have started around October 12, 2022, slowly picking up steam to a concentrated effort around October 22," software supply chain security company Phylum  said  in a report published this week.  The list of offending packages is as follows: typesutil, typestring, sutiltype, duonet, fatnoob, strinfer, pydprotect, incrivelsim, twyne, pyptext, installpy, faq, colorwin, requests-httpx, colorsama, shaasigma, stringe, felpesviadinho, cypress, pystyte, pyslyte, pystyle, pyurllib, algorithmic, oiu, iao, curlapi, type-color, and pyhints.   Collectively, the packages have been downloaded more than 5,700 times, with some of the libraries (e.g., twyne and colorsama) relying on typosquatting to trick unsuspecting users

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning of an uptick among nation-state and criminal actors increasingly leveraging publicly-disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities for breaching target environments.  The tech giant, in its 114-page  Digital Defense Report , said it has "observed a reduction in the time between the announcement of a vulnerability and the commoditization of that vulnerability," making it imperative that organizations patch such exploits in a timely manner.  This also corroborates with an April 2022 advisory from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which  found  that bad actors are "aggressively" targeting newly disclosed software bugs against broad targets globally.   Microsoft noted that it only takes 14 days on average for an exploit to be available in the wild after public disclosure of a flaw, stating that while zero-day attacks are initially limited in scope, they tend to be swiftly adopted by other threat actors, leading to indiscriminat

The Transparent Tribe threat actor has been linked to a new campaign aimed at Indian government organizations with trojanized versions of a two-factor authentication solution called Kavach .  "This group abuses Google advertisements for the purpose of malvertising to distribute backdoored versions of Kavach multi-authentication (MFA) applications," Zscaler ThreatLabz researcher Sudeep Singh  said  in a Thursday analysis.  The cybersecurity company said the advanced persistent threat group has also conducted low-volume credential harvesting attacks in which rogue websites masquerading as official Indian government websites were set up to lure unwitting users into entering their passwords.  Transparent Tribe, also known by the monikers APT36, Operation C-Major, and Mythic Leopard, is a suspected Pakistan  adversarial collective  that has a  history  of striking Indian and Afghanistan entities.

Your OT Is No Longer Isolated: Act Fast to Protect It<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/your-ot-is-no-longer-isolated-act-fast.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Not too long ago, there was a clear separation between the operational technology (OT) that drives the physical functions of a company – on the factory floor, for example – and the information technology (IT) that manages a company's data to enable management and planning.   As IT assets became increasingly connected to the outside world via the internet, OT remained isolated from IT – and the rest of the world.  However, the spread of Industrial IoT (IIoT) as well as the need for constant monitoring and tracking information from manufacturing and assembly lines mean the connection between IT and OT systems has greatly expanded. OT is no longer isolated. OT is now just as exposed to the outside world as IT is.  What does this mean for OT security, where hard-to-access devices needed for 24/7 production are difficult to patch? Let's take a look.  The Air Gap Is Gone  Not so long ago, any data exchange between IT and OT operated via a "sneaker net." An operator would p

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has  published  three Industrial Control Systems (ICS) advisories about multiple vulnerabilities in software from ETIC Telecom, Nokia, and Delta Industrial Automation.  Prominent among them is a set of three flaws affecting ETIC Telecom's Remote Access Server (RAS), which "could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information and compromise the vulnerable device and other connected machines," CISA said.   This includes CVE-2022-3703 (CVSS score: 9.0), a critical flaw that stems from the RAS web portal's inability to verify the authenticity of firmware, thereby making it possible to slip in a rogue package that grants backdoor access to the adversary.  Two other flaws relate to a directory traversal bug in the RAS API (CVE-2022-41607, CVSS score: 8.6) and a file upload issue (CVE-2022-40981, CVSS score: 8.3) that can be exploited to read arbitrary files and upload malicious files that can compromise th

Researchers Find Links b/w Black Basta Ransomware and FIN7 Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/researchers-find-links-bw-black-basta.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new analysis of tools put to use by the Black Basta ransomware operation has identified ties between the threat actor and the  FIN7  (aka Carbanak) group.  This link "could suggest either that Black Basta and FIN7 maintain a special relationship or that one or more individuals belong to both groups," cybersecurity firm SentinelOne  said  in a technical write-up shared with The Hacker News.  Black Basta, which  emerged  earlier this year, has been attributed to a ransomware spree that has claimed over 90 organizations as of September 2022, suggesting that the adversary is both well-organized and well-resourced.  One notable aspect that makes the group stand out, per SentinelOne, is the fact that there have been no signs of its operators attempting to recruit affiliates or advertising the malware as a RaaS on darknet forums or crimeware marketplaces.  This has raised the possibility that the Black Basta developers either cut out affiliates from the chain and deploy the ranso

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Every SaaS app user and login is a potential threat; whether it's bad actors or potential disgruntled former associates,  identity management and   access control  is crucial to prevent unwanted or mistaken entrances to the organization's data and systems.   Since enterprises have thousands to tens of thousands of users, and hundreds to thousands of different apps, ensuring each entrance point and user role is secure is no easy feat. Security teams need to monitor all identities to ensure that user activity meets their organization's security guidelines.   Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions administer user identities and control access to enterprise resources and applications. As identities became the new perimeter, making sure this area is governed by the security team is vital.  Gartner has recently named a new security discipline called Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) that incorporates detection mechanisms that investigate suspicious posture ch

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A French-speaking threat actor dubbed  OPERA1ER  has been linked to a series of more than 30 successful cyber attacks aimed at banks, financial services, and telecom companies across Africa, Asia, and Latin America between 2018 and 2022.  According to Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity company Group-IB, the attacks have led to thefts totaling $11 million, with actual damages estimated to be as high as $30 million.  Some of the more recent attacks in 2021 and 2021 have singled out five different banks in Burkina Faso, Benin, Ivory Coast, and Senegal. Many of the victims identified are said to have been compromised twice, and their infrastructure subsequently weaponized to strike other organizations.  OPERA1ER, also known by the names DESKTOP-GROUP, Common Raven, and NXSMS, is known to be active since 2016, operating with the goal of conducting financially motivated heists and exfiltration of documents for further use in spear-phishing attacks.

The operators of RomCom RAT are continuing to evolve their campaigns with rogue versions of software such as SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor, KeePass password manager, and PDF Reader Pro.

The latest findings  come  a week after the Canadian cybersecurity company disclosed a spear-phishing campaign aimed at Ukrainian entities to deploy a remote access trojan called RomCom RAT.  The unknown threat actor has also been observed leveraging trojanized variants of Advanced IP Scanner and pdfFiller as droppers to distribute the implant.

Popular short-form video-sharing service TikTok is revising its  privacy policy  for European users to make it explicitly clear that user data can be accessed by some employees from across the world, including China.  The ByteDance-owned platform, which currently stores European user data in the U.S. and Singapore, said the revision is part of its ongoing data governance efforts to limit employee access to users in the region, minimize data flows outside of it, and store the information locally.  The privacy policy update applies to users located in the U.K., the European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland, and goes into effect on December 2, 2022, according to  The Guardian .

Raccoon Stealer is back on the news again. US officials arrested Mark Sokolovsky, one of the malware actors behind this program. In July 2022, after several months of the shutdown, a Raccoon Stealer V2 went viral. Last week, the Department of Justice's press release stated that the malware collected 50 million credentials.  This article will give a quick guide to the latest info stealer's version.  What is Raccoon infostealer V2?  Raccoon Stealer  is a kind of malware that steals various data from an infected computer. It's quite a basic malware, but hackers have made Raccoon popular with excellent service and simple navigation.   In 2019, Raccoon infostealer was one of the most discussed malware. In exchange for $75 per week and $200 per month, cybercriminals sold this simple but versatile info stealer as a MaaS. The malware was successful in attacking a number of systems. In March 2022, however, threat authors ceased to operate.   An updated version of this malware was r

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Android spyware campaign has been found striking Persian-speaking individuals by masquerading as a seemingly harmless VPN application.  Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky is tracking the campaign under the moniker  SandStrike . It has not been attributed to any particular threat group.  "SandStrike is distributed as a means to access resources about the  Bahá'í religion  that are banned in Iran," the company noted in its  APT trends report  for the third quarter of 2022.   While the app is ostensibly designed to provide victims with a VPN connection to bypass the ban, it's also configured to covertly siphon data from the victims' devices, such as call logs, contacts, and even connect to a remote server to fetch additional commands.  The booby-trapped VPN service, while fully functional, is said to be distributed via a Telegram channel controlled by the adversary.  Links to the channel are also advertised on fabricated social media acco

File hosting service Dropbox on Tuesday disclosed that it was the victim of a phishing campaign that allowed unidentified threat actors to gain unauthorized access to 130 of its source code repositories on GitHub.  "These repositories included our own copies of third-party libraries slightly modified for use by Dropbox, internal prototypes, and some tools and configuration files used by the security team," the company  revealed  in an advisory.  The breach resulted in the access of some API keys used by Dropbox developers as well as "a few thousand names and email addresses belonging to Dropbox employees, current and past customers, sales leads, and vendors."   It, however, stressed that the repositories did not contain source code related to its core apps or infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The OpenSSL project has rolled out fixes to contain two high-severity flaws in its widely used cryptography library that could result in a denial-of-service (DoS) and remote code execution.  The issues, tracked as  CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 , have been described as buffer overrun vulnerabilities that can be triggered during X.509 certificate verification by supplying a specially-crafted email address.  "In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server," OpenSSL said in an advisory for CVE-2022-3786. "In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects."   OpenSSL is an  open source implementation  of the SSL and TLS protocols used for secure communication and is baked into several operating systems and a wide range of software.  Versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6 of the library are affected by the new flaws, which has been remediated in version 3.0.7. It's worth noting tha

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Tuesday said it addressed an authentication bypass vulnerability in  Jupyter Notebooks  for Azure Cosmos DB that enabled full read and write access.  The tech giant said the problem was introduced on August 12, 2022, and rectified worldwide on October 6, 2022, two days after responsible disclosure from Orca Security, which dubbed the flaw  CosMiss .  "In short, if an attacker had knowledge of a Notebook's 'forwardingId,' which is the UUID of the Notebook Workspace, they would have had full permissions on the Notebook without having to authenticate, including read and write access, and the ability to modify the file system of the container running the notebook," researchers Lidor Ben Shitrit and Roee Sagi said.   This container modification could ultimately pave the way for obtaining remote code execution in the Notebook container by overwriting a Python file associated with the  Cosmos DB Explorer  to spawn a reverse shell.

The Chinese state-sponsored threat actor known as Stone Panda  has been observed employing a new stealthy infection chain in its attacks aimed at Japanese entities.  Targets include media, diplomatic, governmental and public sector organizations and think-tanks in Japan, according to  twin   reports  published by Kaspersky.  Stone Panda , also called  APT10 , Bronze Riverside, Cicada, and Potassium, is a cyber  espionage group  known for its intrusions against organizations identified as strategically significant to China. The threat actor is believed to have been active since at least 2009.   The latest set of attacks, observed between March and June 2022, involve the use of a bogus Microsoft Word file and a self-extracting archive ( SFX ) file in RAR format propagated via spear-phishing emails, leading to the execution of a backdoor called LODEINFO.

Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux and Git, has his own law in software development, and it goes like this: " given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow ." This phrase puts the finger on the very principle of open source: the more, the merrier - if the code is easily available for anyone and everyone to fix bugs, it's pretty safe. But is it? Or is the saying "all bugs are shallow" only true for  shallow  bugs and not ones that lie deeper? It turns out that security flaws in open source can be harder to find than we thought. Emil Wåreus, Head of R&D at  Debricked , took it upon himself to look deeper into the community's performance. As the data scientist he is, he, of course, asked the data:  how good is the open source community at finding vulnerabilities in a timely manner ?  The thrill of the (vulnerability) hunt  Finding open source vulnerabilities is typically done by the maintainers of the open source project, users, auditors, or external secur
