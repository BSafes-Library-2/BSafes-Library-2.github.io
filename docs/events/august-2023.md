  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An open-source .NET-based information stealer malware dubbed  SapphireStealer  is being used by multiple entities to enhance its capabilities and spawn their own bespoke variants. "Information-stealing malware like SapphireStealer can be used to obtain sensitive information, including corporate credentials, which are often resold to other threat actors who leverage the access for additional attacks, including operations related to espionage or ransomware/extortion," Cisco Talos researcher Edmund Brumaghin  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. An entire ecosystem has developed over time that allows both financially motivated and nation-state actors to use services from purveyors of stealer malware to carry out various kinds of attacks. Viewed in that light, such malware not only represents an evolution of the cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS) model, they also offer other threat actors to monetize the stolen data to distribute ransomware, conduct data theft, and other maliciou

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Three additional rogue Python packages have been discovered in the Package Index (PyPI) repository as part of an ongoing malicious software supply chain campaign called  VMConnect , with signs pointing to the involvement of North Korean state-sponsored threat actors. The  findings  come from ReversingLabs, which detected the packages tablediter, request-plus, and requestspro. First disclosed at the start of the month by the company and Sonatype,  VMConnect  refers to a collection of Python packages that mimic popular open-source Python tools to download an unknown second-stage malware. The latest tranche is no different, with ReversingLabs noting that the bad actors are disguising their packages and making them appear trustworthy by using typosquatting techniques to impersonate prettytable and requests and confuse developers. The nefarious code within tablediter is designed to run in an endless execution loop in which a remote server is polled periodically to retrieve and execute

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hacking outfit nicknamed  Earth Estries  has been attributed to a new, ongoing cyber espionage campaign targeting government and technology industries based in the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Africa, Germany, and the U.S. "The threat actors behind Earth Estries are working with high-level resources and functioning with sophisticated skills and experience in cyber espionage and illicit activities," Trend Micro researchers Ted Lee, Lenart Bermejo, Hara Hiroaki, Leon M Chang, and Gilbert Sison  said . Active since at least 2020, Earth Estries is said to share tactical overlaps with another nation-state group tracked as  FamousSparrow , which was first exposed by ESET in 2021 as exploiting ProxyLogon flaws in Microsoft Exchange Server to penetrate hospitality, government, engineering, and legal sectors.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New findings show that malicious actors could leverage a sneaky malware detection evasion technique and bypass endpoint security solutions by manipulating the Windows Container Isolation Framework. The findings were presented by Deep Instinct security researcher Daniel Avinoam at the  DEF CON security conference  held earlier this month. Microsoft's  container architecture  (and by extension,  Windows Sandbox ) uses what's called a  dynamically generated image  to separate the file system from each container to the host and at the same time avoid duplication of system files. It's nothing but an "operating system image that has clean copies of files that can change, but links to files that cannot change that are in the Windows image that already exists on the host," thereby bringing down the overall size for a full OS. "The result is images that contain 'ghost files,' which store no actual data but point to a different volume on the system,"

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Android banking trojan dubbed  MMRat  has been observed targeting mobile users in Southeast Asia since late June 2023 to remotely commandeer the devices and perform financial fraud. "The malware, named after its distinctive package name com.mm.user, can capture user input and screen content, and can also remotely control victim devices through various techniques, enabling its operators to carry out bank fraud on the victim's device," Trend Micro  said . What makes MMRat stand apart from others of its kind is the use of a customized command-and-control (C2) protocol based on protocol buffers (aka  protobuf ) to efficiently transfer large volumes of data from compromised handsets, demonstrating the growing sophistication of Android malware. Possible targets based on the language used in the phishing pages include Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, and the Philippines.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Recently disclosed security flaws impacting Juniper firewalls, Openfire, and Apache RocketMQ servers have come under active exploitation in the wild, according to multiple reports. The Shadowserver Foundation  said  that it's "seeing exploitation attempts from multiple IPs for Juniper J-Web CVE-2023-36844 (& friends) targeting /webauth_operation.php endpoint," the same day a proof-of-concept (PoC) became available. The  issues , tracked as CVE-2023-36844, CVE-2023-36845, CVE-2023-36846, and CVE-2023-36847, reside in the J-Web component of Junos OS on Juniper SRX and EX Series. They could be chained by an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to execute arbitrary code on susceptible installations. Patches for the flaw were released on August 17, 2023, a week after which watchTowr Labs published a proof-of-concept (PoC) by combining CVE-2023-36846 and CVE-2023-36845 to execute a PHP file containing malicious shellcode. Currently, there are  more than 8,200 Junip

Critical Vulnerability Alert: VMware Aria Operations Networks at Risk from Remote Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/critical-vulnerability-alert-vmware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware has released software updates to correct two security vulnerabilities in Aria Operations for Networks that could be potentially exploited to bypass authentication and gain remote code execution. The most severe of the flaws is CVE-2023-34039 (CVSS score: 9.8), which relates to a case of authentication bypass arising as a result of a lack of unique cryptographic key generation. "A malicious actor with network access to Aria Operations for Networks could bypass SSH authentication to gain access to the Aria Operations for Networks CLI," the company  said  in an advisory. ProjectDiscovery researchers Harsh Jaiswal and Rahul Maini have been credited with discovering and reporting the issue. The second weakness, CVE-2023-20890 (CVSS score: 7.2), is an arbitrary file write vulnerability impacting Aria Operations for Networks that could be abused by an adversary with administrative access to write files to arbitrary locations and achieve remote code execution.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coordinated law enforcement effort codenamed  Operation Duck Hunt  has felled  QakBot , a notorious Windows malware family that's estimated to have compromised over 700,000 computers globally and facilitated financial fraud as well as ransomware. To that end, the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ)  said  the malware is "being deleted from victim computers, preventing it from doing any more harm," adding it seized more than $8.6 million in cryptocurrency in illicit profits. The cross-border exercise involved the participation of France, Germany, Latvia, Romania, the Netherlands, the U.K., and the U.S., alongside technical assistance from cybersecurity company Zscaler. The dismantling has been hailed as "the largest U.S.-led financial and technical disruption of a botnet infrastructure leveraged by cybercriminals." No arrests were announced. QakBot, also known as QBot and Pinkslipbot, started its life as a banking trojan in 2007 before morphing into a general-pu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected Chinese-nexus hacking group exploited a  recently disclosed zero-day flaw  in Barracuda Networks Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances to breach government, military, defense and aerospace, high-tech industry, and telecom sectors as part of a global espionage campaign. Mandiant, which is tracking the activity under the name  UNC4841 , described the threat actor as "highly responsive to defensive efforts" and capable of actively tweaking their modus operandi to maintain persistent access to targets. "UNC4841 deployed new and novel malware designed to maintain presence at a small subset of high priority targets that it compromised either before the patch was released, or shortly following Barracuda's remediation guidance," the Google-owned threat intelligence firm  said  in a new technical report published today. Almost a third of the identified affected organizations are government agencies. Interestingly enough, some of the earliest compromises

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malspam campaign has been observed deploying an off-the-shelf malware called DarkGate . "The current spike in DarkGate malware activity is plausible given the fact that the developer of the malware has recently started to rent out the malware to a limited number of affiliates," Telekom Security  said  in a report published last week. The latest report build onn  recent findings  from security researcher Igal Lytzki, who detailed a "high volume campaign" that leverages hijacked email threads to trick recipients into downloading the malware. The attack commences with a phishing URL that, when clicked, passes through a traffic direction system ( TDS ) to take the victim to an MSI payload subject to certain conditions. This includes the presence of a refresh header in the HTTP response. Opening the MSI file triggers a multi-stage process that incorporates an AutoIt script to execute shellcode that acts as a conduit to decrypt and launch DarkGate via a crypte

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ask any security professional and they'll tell you that remediating risks from various siloed security scanning tools requires a tedious and labor-intensive series of steps focused on deduplication, prioritization, and routing of issues to an appropriate "fixer" somewhere in the organization. This burden on already resource-strapped security teams is an efficiency killer.  A new study , commissioned by Seemplicity and conducted by Dark Reading, provides fresh insight into how security pros handle the challenging remediation life cycle from discovery to resolution. The research reveals the obstacles security professionals face when coordinating remediation activities. The data exposes the outcomes — in increased workload and diminished risk posture — that arise from lengthy remediation times, inefficient and uncontrolled manual processes, the lack of managerial visibility and oversight across the risk life cycle.  Remediation Process Broken Down to Steps and Time Spent on Each Step

Unpatched Citrix NetScaler systems exposed to the internet are being targeted by unknown threat actors in what's suspected to be a ransomware attack. Cybersecurity company Sophos is  tracking  the activity cluster under the moniker  STAC4663 . Attack chains involve the exploitation of  CVE-2023-3519 , a critical code injection vulnerability impacting NetScaler ADC and Gateway servers that could facilitate unauthenticated remote code execution. In one intrusion detected in mid-August 2023, the security flaw is said to have been used to conduct a domain-wide attack, including injecting payloads into legitimate executables such as the Windows Update Agent (wuauclt.exe) and the Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Service (wmiprvse.exe). An analysis of the payload is underway. Other notable aspects include the distribution of obfuscated PowerShell scripts, PHP web shells, and the use of an Estonian service called BlueVPS for malware staging. Sophos said the modus operandi

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning of an increase in adversary-in-the-middle ( AiTM ) phishing techniques, which are being propagated as part of the phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) cybercrime model. In addition to an uptick in AiTM-capable PhaaS platforms, the tech giant noted that existing phishing services like PerSwaysion are incorporating AiTM capabilities. "This development in the PhaaS ecosystem enables attackers to conduct high-volume phishing campaigns that attempt to circumvent MFA protections at scale," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team  said  in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). Phishing kits with AiTM capabilities work in two ways, one of which concerns the use of reverse proxy servers (i.e., the phishing page) to relay traffic to and from the client and legitimate website and stealthily capture user credentials, two-factor authentication codes, and session cookies. A second method involves synchronous relay servers. "In AiTM through synchronous relay s

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a case of privilege escalation associated with a Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) application by taking advantage of an abandoned reply URL. "An attacker could leverage this abandoned URL to redirect authorization codes to themselves, exchanging the ill-gotten authorization codes for access tokens," Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)  said  in a technical report published last week. "The threat actor could then call Power Platform API via a middle-tier service and obtain elevated privileges." Following responsible disclosure on April 5, 2023, the issue was addressed by Microsoft via an update released a day later. Secureworks has also made available an  open-source tool  that other organizations can use to scan for abandoned reply URLs.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In yet another sign that developers continue to be targets of software supply chain attacks, a number of malicious packages have been discovered on the Rust programming language's crate registry. The libraries, uploaded between August 14 and 16, 2023, were published by a user named "amaperf," Phylum  said  in a report published last week. The names of the packages, now taken down, are as follows: postgress, if-cfg, xrvrv, serd, oncecell, lazystatic, and envlogger. It's not clear what the end goal of the campaign was, but the suspicious modules were found to harbor functionalities to capture the operating system information (i.e., Windows, Linux, macOS, or Unknown) and transmit the data to a hard-coded Telegram channel via the messaging platform's API. This suggests that the campaign may have been in its early stages and that the threat actor may have been casting a wide net to compromise as many developer machines as possible to deliver rogue updates with imp

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cyber attacks on e-commerce applications are a common trend in 2023 as e-commerce businesses become more omnichannel, they build and deploy increasingly more API interfaces, with threat actors constantly exploring more ways to exploit vulnerabilities. This is why regular testing and ongoing monitoring are necessary to fully protect web applications, identifying weaknesses so they can be mitigated quickly. In this article, we will discuss the recent Honda e-commerce platform attack, how it happened, and its impact on the business and its clients.

KmsdBot Malware Gets an Upgrade: Now Targets IoT Devices with Enhanced Capabilities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/kmsdbot-malware-gets-upgrade-now.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An updated version of a botnet malware called  KmsdBot  is now targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices, simultaneously branching out its capabilities and the attack surface. "The binary now includes support for  Telnet scanning  and support for more CPU architectures," Akamai security researcher Larry W. Cashdollar  said  in an analysis published this month. The latest iteration, observed since July 16, 2023, comes months after it emerged that the botnet is being offered as a  DDoS-for-hire service  to other threat actors. The fact that it's being actively maintained indicates its effectiveness in real-world attacks. KmsdBot was  first documented  by the web infrastructure and security company in November 2022. It's mainly designed to target private gaming servers and cloud hosting providers, although it has since set its eyes on some Romanian government and Spanish educational sites. The malware is designed to scan random IP addresses for open SSH ports and

LockBit 3.0 Ransomware Builder Leak Gives Rise to Hundreds of New Variants<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/lockbit-30-ransomware-builder-leak.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The leak of the  LockBit 3.0 ransomware  builder last year has led to threat actors abusing the tool to spawn new variants. Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky said it detected a ransomware intrusion that deployed a version of LockBit but with a markedly different ransom demand procedure. "The attacker behind this incident decided to use a different ransom note with a headline related to a previously unknown group, called NATIONAL HAZARD AGENCY," security researchers Eduardo Ovalle and Francesco Figurelli  said . The revamped ransom note directly specified the amount to be paid to obtain the decryption keys, and directed communications to a Tox service and email, unlike the LockBit group, which doesn't mention the amount and uses its own communication and negotiation platform. NATIONAL HAZARD AGENCY is far from the only cybercrime gang to use the leaked LockBit 3.0 builder. Some of the other threat actors known to leverage it include  Bl00dy and Buhti . Kaspersk

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Risk and financial advisory solutions provider Kroll on Friday disclosed that one of its employees fell victim to a "highly sophisticated" SIM swapping attack. The incident, which took place on August 19, 2023, targeted the employee's T-Mobile account, the company said. "Specifically, T-Mobile, without any authority from or contact with Kroll or its employee, transferred that employee's phone number to the threat actor's phone at their request," it  said  in an advisory. This enabled the unidentified actor to gain access to certain files containing personal information of bankruptcy claimants in the matters of BlockFi , FTX , and Genesis. SIM swapping (aka SIM splitting or simjacking), while generally a benign process, could be exploited by threat actors to fraudulently activate a SIM card under their control with a victim's phone number. This makes it possible to intercept SMS messages and voice calls and receive MFA-related messages that cont

Two U.K. teenagers have been convicted by a jury in London for being part of the notorious LAPSUS$ transnational gang and for orchestrating a series of brazen, high-profile hacks against major tech firms and demanding a ransom in exchange for not leaking the stolen information. This includes Arion Kurtaj (aka White, Breachbase, WhiteDoxbin, and TeaPotUberHacker), an 18-year-old from Oxford, and an unnamed minor, who began collaborating in July 2021 after having met online, BBC  reported  this week. Both the defendants were initially arrested and released under investigation in January 2022, only to be  re-arrested and charged  by the City of London Police in April 2022. Kurtaj was subsequently granted bail and moved to a hotel in Bicester after he was doxxed in an online cybercrime forum. He, however, continued his hacking spree, targeting companies like  Uber ,  Revolut , and  Rockstar Games , as a result of which he was  arrested again  in September. Another alleged member of the

Every company has some level of tech debt. Unless you're a brand new start-up, you most likely have a patchwork of solutions that have been implemented throughout the years, often under various leadership teams with different priorities and goals. As those technologies age, they can leave your organization vulnerable to cyber threats. While replacing legacy technologies can be costly, those costs may pale in comparison to a breach – both in terms of immediate financial impact and reputational damage.  Here are three ways you can communicate risk to your leadership team as you work to replace legacy infrastructure. 1: Make the Risk Real Leadership teams are driven by quantifiable business implications. The best way to get support for updating or replacing legacy technology is to make the risk to the business real - and measurable - in a language they understand. One way to do this is to look at the list of critical vulnerabilities that you've identified, then evaluate the impact t

A nation-state activity group originating from China has been linked to cyber attacks on dozens of organizations in Taiwan as part of a suspected espionage campaign. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence team is tracking the activity under the name  Flax Typhoon , which is also known as Ethereal Panda. "Flax Typhoon gains and maintains long-term access to Taiwanese organizations' networks with minimal use of malware, relying on tools built into the operating system, along with some normally benign software to quietly remain in these networks," the company  said . It further said it hasn't observed the group weaponize the access to conduct data-collection and exfiltration. A majority of the targets include government agencies, educational institutions, critical manufacturing, and information technology organizations in Taiwan.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning that Barracuda Networks Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances patched against a recently disclosed critical flaw continue to be at risk of potential compromise from suspected Chinese hacking groups. It also  deemed  the fixes as "ineffective" and that it "continues to observe active intrusions and considers all affected Barracuda ESG appliances to be compromised and vulnerable to this exploit." Tracked as  CVE-2023-2868  (CVSS score: 9.8), the zero-day bug is said to have been weaponized as early as October 2022, more than seven months before the security hole was plugged. Google-owned Mandiant is tracking the China-nexus activity cluster under the name  UNC4841 . The remote command injection vulnerability, impacting versions 5.1.3.001 through 9.2.0.006, allows for unauthorized execution of system commands with administrator privileges on the ESG product.

The North Korea-linked threat actor known as Lazarus Group has been observed exploiting a now-patched critical security flaw impacting Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus to distribute a remote access trojan called such as  QuiteRAT . Targets include internet backbone infrastructure and healthcare entities in Europe and the U.S., cybersecurity company Cisco Talos said in a  two-part   analysis  published today. What's more, a closer examination of the adversary's recycled attack infrastructure in its cyber assaults on enterprises has led to the discovery of a new threat dubbed  CollectionRAT . The fact that the Lazarus Group continues to rely on the same tradecraft despite those components being well-documented over the years underscores the threat actor's confidence in their operations, Talos pointed out. QuiteRAT is said to be a successor to  MagicRAT , itself a follow-up to TigerRAT, while CollectionRAT appears to share overlaps with  EarlyRAT  (aka  Jupiter ), an im

A new financially motivated operation is leveraging a malicious Telegram bot to help threat actors scam their victims. Dubbed  Telekopye , a portmanteau of Telegram and kopye (meaning "spear" in Russian), the toolkit functions as an  automated means  to create a phishing web page from a premade template and send the URL to potential victims, codenamed Mammoths by the criminals. "This toolkit is implemented as a Telegram bot that, when activated, provides several easy-to-navigate menus in the form of clickable buttons that can accommodate many scammers at once," ESET researcher Radek Jizba  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. The exact origins of the threat actors, dubbed Neanderthals, are unclear, but evidence points to Russia as the country of origin of the toolkit's authors and users, owing to the use of Russian SMS templates and the fact that a majority of the targeted online marketplaces are popular in the country.

Public Wi-Fi, which has long since become the norm, poses threats to not only individual users but also businesses. With the rise of remote work, people can now work from virtually anywhere: a cafe close to home, a hotel in a different city, or even while waiting for a plane at the airport. Next, let's explore the risks of connecting to public Wi-Fi, both for you personally and for businesses. According to the  Forbes Advisor  the majority of people (56%) connect to public Wi-Fi networks that don't require a password. This convenience comes at a price, and many are unaware that attackers can steal card details, passwords, and other sensitive information. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:  This is one of the most common threats on public Wi-Fi. In an MITM attack, the hacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties. The user believes they are directly communicating with a website, email server, or another user, but the hacker is relaying t

The SmokeLoader malware is being used to deliver a new Wi-Fi scanning malware strain called  Whiffy Recon  on compromised Windows machines. "The new malware strain has only one operation. Every 60 seconds it triangulates the infected systems' positions by scanning nearby Wi-Fi access points as a data point for Google's geolocation API," Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)  said  in a statement shared with The Hacker News. "The location returned by Google's  Geolocation API  is then sent back to the adversary." SmokeLoader , as the name implies, is a loader malware whose sole purpose is to drop additional payloads onto a host. Since 2014, the malware has been  offered for sale  to Russian-based threat actors. It's traditionally distributed via phishing emails. Whiffy Recon works by checking for the WLAN AutoConfig service (WLANSVC) on the infected system and terminating itself if the service name doesn't exist. It's worth noting that th

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recently patched security flaw in the popular WinRAR archiving software has been exploited as a zero-day since April 2023, new findings from Group-IB reveal. The vulnerability, cataloged as  CVE-2023-38831 , allows threat actors to spoof file extensions, thereby making it possible to launch malicious scripts contained within an archive that masquerades as seemingly innocuous image or text files. It was addressed in  version 6.23  released on August 2, 2023, alongside CVE-2023-40477. In attacks discovered by the Singapore-based firm in July 2023, specially crafted ZIP or RAR archive files distributed via trading-related forums such as Forex Station have been used to deliver a variety of malware families such as DarkMe,  GuLoader , and  Remcos RAT . "After infecting devices, the cybercriminals withdraw money from broker accounts," Group-IB malware analyst Andrey Polovinkin  said , adding as many as 130 traders' devices have been compromised as part of the campaign.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Thousands of  Openfire XMPP servers  are unpatched against a recently disclosed high-severity flaw and are susceptible to a new exploit, according to a  new report  from VulnCheck. Tracked as  CVE-2023-32315  (CVSS score: 7.5), the vulnerability relates to a path traversal vulnerability in Openfire's administrative console that could permit an unauthenticated attacker to access otherwise restricted pages reserved for privileged users. It affects all versions of the software released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0. It was remediated by its developer, Ignite Realtime, earlier this May with the release of versions 4.6.8, 4.7.5, and 4.8.0. "Path traversal protections were already in place to protect against exactly this kind of attack, but didn't defend against certain non-standard URL encoding for UTF-16 characters that were not supported by the embedded web server that was in use at the time," the maintainers  said  in a detailed advisory.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) on Wednesday  unsealed an indictment  against two founders of the now-sanctioned Tornado Cash cryptocurrency mixer service, charging them with laundering more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds. Both the individuals, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Storm, 34, is said to have been arrested in the U.S. state of Washington. Semenov, 35, remains at large in Dubai. They are alleged to have "made millions of dollars in profits" from promoting and operating the service. Tornado Cash is estimated to have processed upwards of $7 billion worth of crypto assets over a period of three years. In a related move, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned  Semenov and  eight cryptocurrency addresses  connected to him, days after a U.S. cou

North Korean Affiliates Suspected in $40M Cryptocurrency Heist, FBI Warns<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/north-korean-affiliates-suspected-in.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Tuesday warned that threat actors affiliated with North Korea may attempt to cash out stolen cryptocurrency worth more than $40 million. The law enforcement agency  attributed  the blockchain activity to an adversary the U.S. government tracks as TraderTraitor, which is also known by the name Jade Sleet. An investigation undertaken by the FBI found that the group moved approximately 1,580 bitcoin from several cryptocurrency heists over the past 24 hours and are currently said to be holding those funds in six different wallets. North Korea is known to blur the lines among cyber warfare, espionage, and financial crime.  TraderTraitor , in particular, has been linked to a series of attacks targeting blockchain and cryptocurrency exchanges with the goal of plundering digital assets to generate illicit revenue for the sanctions-hit nation. This includes the $60 million theft of virtual currency from Alphapo on June 22, 2023; the $37 m

Meta has once again reaffirmed its plans to roll out support for end-to-end encryption ( E2EE ) by default for one-to-one friends and family chats on Messenger by the end of the year. As part of that effort, the social media giant said it's upgrading "millions more people's chats" effective August 22, 2023, exactly seven months after it  started gradually expanding the feature  to more users in January 2023. The changes are part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's "privacy-focused vision for social networking" that was announced in 2019, although it has since encountered significant technical challenges, causing it to  delay its plans  by a year. "Like many messaging services, Messenger and Instagram DMs were originally designed to function via servers," Timothy Buck, product manager for Messenger,  said .

A Syrian threat actor named  EVLF  has been outed as the creator of malware families CypherRAT and CraxsRAT. "These RATs are designed to allow an attacker to remotely perform real-time actions and control the victim device's camera, location, and microphone," Cybersecurity firm Cyfirma  said  in a report published last week. CypherRAT and CraxsRAT are said to be offered to other cybercriminals as part of a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) scheme. As many as 100 unique threat actors are estimated to have purchased the twin tools on a lifetime license over the past three years. EVLF is said to be operating a web shop to advertise their warez since at least September 2022. CraxsRAT is billed as an Android trojan that enables a threat actor to remote control an infected device from a Windows computer, with the developer consistently releasing new updates based on feedback from the customers.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious toolset dubbed  Spacecolon  is being deployed as part of an ongoing campaign to spread variants of the Scarab ransomware across victim organizations globally. "It probably finds its way into victim organizations by its operators compromising vulnerable web servers or via brute forcing RDP credentials," ESET security researcher Jakub Souček  said  in a detailed technical write-up published Tuesday. The Slovak cybersecurity firm, which dubbed the threat actor CosmicBeetle, said the origins of the Spacecolon date back to May 2020. The highest concentration of victims has been detected in France, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and Turkey. While the exact provenance of the adversary is unclear, several Spacecolon variants are said to contain Turkish strings, likely pointing to the involvement of a Turkish-speaking developer. There is no evidence currently linking it to any other known threat actor group. Some of the targets include a hospital and a tourist reso

Over a Dozen Malicious npm Packages Target Roblox Game Developers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/over-dozen-malicious-npm-packages.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More than a dozen malicious packages have been discovered on the npm package repository since the start of August 2023 with capabilities to deploy an open-source information stealer called  Luna Token Grabber  on systems belonging to Roblox developers. The ongoing campaign, first detected on August 1 by ReversingLabs, employs modules that masquerade as the legitimate package  noblox.js , an API wrapper that's used to create scripts that interact with the Roblox gaming platform. The software supply chain security company described the activity as a "replay of an attack  uncovered  two years ago" in October 2021. "The malicious packages [...] reproduce code from the legitimate noblox.js package but add malicious, information-stealing functions," software threat researcher Lucija Valentić  said  in a Tuesday analysis. The packages were cumulatively downloaded 963 times before they were taken down. The names of the rogue packages are as follows - noblox.js-v

A  new State of SaaS Security Posture Management Report  from SaaS cybersecurity provider  AppOmni  indicates that Cybersecurity, IT, and business leaders alike recognize SaaS cybersecurity as an increasingly important part of the cyber threat landscape. And at first glance, respondents appear generally optimistic about their SaaS cybersecurity. Over 600 IT, cybersecurity, and business leaders at companies between 500-2,500+ employees were surveyed and responded with confidence in their SaaS cybersecurity preparedness and capabilities. For example: When asked to rate the SaaS cybersecurity maturity level of their organizations, 71% noted that their organizations' SaaS cybersecurity maturity has achieved either a mid-high level (43%) or the highest level (28%). For the security levels of the SaaS applications authorized for use in their organization, sentiment was similarly high.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented threat cluster has been linked to a software supply chain attack targeting organizations primarily located in Hong Kong and other regions in Asia. The Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, is tracking the activity under its insect-themed moniker Carderbee. The attacks, per the cybersecurity firm, leverage a trojanized version of a legitimate software called EsafeNet Cobra DocGuard Client to deliver a known backdoor called  PlugX  (aka Korplug) on victim networks. "In the course of this attack, the attackers used malware signed with a legitimate Microsoft certificate," the company  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. The use of Cobra DocGuard Client to pull off a supply chain attack was previously highlighted by ESET in its  quarterly Threat Report  this year, detailing a September 2022 intrusion in which an unnamed gambling company in Hong Kong was compromised via a malicious update pushed by the software.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new variant of an  Apple macOS malware  called  XLoader  has surfaced in the wild, masquerading its malicious features under the guise of an office productivity app called "OfficeNote." "The new version of XLoader is bundled inside a standard Apple disk image with the name OfficeNote.dmg," SentinelOne security researchers Dinesh Devadoss and Phil Stokes  said  in a Monday analysis. "The application contained within is signed with the developer signature MAIT JAKHU (54YDV8NU9C)." XLoader , first detected in 2020, is  considered  a successor to Formbook and is an information stealer and keylogger offered under the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model. A macOS variant of the malware emerged in July 2021, distributed as a Java program in the form of a compiled .JAR file. "Such files require the Java Runtime Environment, and for that reason the malicious .jar file will not execute on a macOS install out of the box, since Apple stopped shipping JRE with

Software services provider Ivanti is  warning  of a new critical zero-day flaw impacting Ivanti Sentry (formerly MobileIron Sentry) that it said is being actively exploited in the wild, marking an escalation of its security woes. Tracked as  CVE-2023-38035  (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue has been described as a case of authentication bypass impacting versions 9.18 and prior due to what it called an due to an insufficiently restrictive Apache HTTPD configuration. "If exploited, this vulnerability enables an unauthenticated actor to access some sensitive APIs that are used to configure the Ivanti Sentry on the administrator portal (port 8443, commonly MICS)," the company  said . "While the issue has a high CVSS score, there is a low risk of exploitation for customers who do not expose port 8443 to the internet." Successful exploitation of the bug could allow an attacker to change configuration, run system commands, or write files onto the system. It's recommen

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has  added  a critical security flaw in Adobe ColdFusion to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. The vulnerability, cataloged as  CVE-2023-26359  (CVSS score: 9.8), relates to a deserialization flaw present in Adobe ColdFusion 2018 (Update 15 and earlier) and ColdFusion 2021 (Update 5 and earlier) that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user without requiring any interaction. Deserialization  (aka unmarshaling) refers to the process of reconstructing a data structure or an object from a byte stream. But when it's performed without validating its source or sanitizing its contents, it can lead to  unexpected consequences  such as code execution or denial-of-service (DoS). It was  patched  by Adobe as part of updates issued in March 2023. As of writing, it's immediately not clear how the flaw is being  abused in the wil

A high-severity security flaw has been disclosed in the WinRAR utility that could be potentially exploited by a threat actor to achieve remote code execution on Windows systems. Tracked as  CVE-2023-40477  (CVSS score: 7.8), the vulnerability has been described as a case of improper validation while processing recovery volumes. "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer," the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)  said  in an advisory. "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process." Successful exploitation of the flaw requires user interaction in that the target must be lured into visiting a malicious page or by simply opening a booby-trapped archive file. A security researcher, who goes by the alias goodbyeselene, has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on June 8, 2023. The issue has been address

How to Investigate an OAuth Grant for Suspicious Activity or Overly Permissive Scopes<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/how-to-investigate-oauth-grant-for.html"> Full Text</a>

From a user's perspective, OAuth works like magic. In just a few keystrokes, you can whisk through the account creation process and gain immediate access to whatever new app or integration you're seeking. Unfortunately, few users understand the implications of the permissions they allow when they create a new OAuth grant, making it easy for malicious actors to manipulate employees into giving away unintended access to corporate environments. In one of the  highest-profile examples , Pawn Storm's attacks against the Democratic National Convention and others leveraged OAuth to target victims through social engineering.  Security and IT teams would be wise to establish a practice of reviewing new and existing OAuth grants programmatically to catch risky activity or overly-permissive scopes. And, there are new solutions for  SaaS security  cropping up that can make this process easier. Let's take a look at some best practices for prioritizing and investigating your organization's grants

Threat actors are leveraging access to malware-infected Windows and macOS machines to deliver a proxy server application and use them as exit nodes to reroute proxy requests. According to AT&T Alien Labs, the unnamed company that offers the proxy service operates more than 400,000 proxy exit nodes, although it's not immediately clear how many of them were co-opted by malware installed on infected machines without user knowledge and interaction. "Although the proxy website claims that its exit nodes come only from users who have been informed and agreed to the use of their device," the cybersecurity company  said  it found evidence where "malware writers are installing the proxy silently in infected systems." Multiple malware families have been observed delivering the proxy to users searching for cracked software and games.

The threat actors behind the HiatusRAT malware have returned from their hiatus with a new wave of reconnaissance and targeting activity aimed at Taiwan-based organizations and a U.S. military procurement system. Besides recompiling malware samples for different architectures, the artifacts are said to have been hosted on new virtual private servers (VPSs), Lumen Black Lotus Labs  said  in a report published last week. The cybersecurity firm described the activity cluster as "brazen" and "one of the most audacious," indicating no signs of slowing down. The identity and the origin of the threat actors are presently unknown. Targets included commercial firms, such as semiconductor and chemical manufacturers, and at least one municipal government organization in Taiwan as well as a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) server associated with submitting and retrieving proposals for defense contracts.

WoofLocker Toolkit Hides Malicious Codes in Images to Run Tech Support Scams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/wooflocker-toolkit-hides-malicious.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed an updated version of an advanced fingerprinting and redirection toolkit called  WoofLocker  that's engineered to conduct tech support scams. The sophisticated traffic redirection scheme was  first documented  by Malwarebytes in January 2020, leveraging JavaScript embedded in compromised websites to perform anti-bot and web traffic filtering checks to serve next-stage JavaScript that redirects users to a browser locker (aka browlock). This redirection mechanism, in turn, makes use of steganographic tricks to conceal the JavaScript code within a PNG image that's served only when the validation phase is successful. Should a user be detected as a bot or not interesting traffic, a decoy PNG file without the malicious code is used. WoofLocker is also known as 404Browlock due to the fact that visiting the browlock URL directly without the appropriate redirection or one-time session token results in a 404 error page.

Networking hardware company Juniper Networks has released an "out-of-cycle" security update to address multiple flaws in the J-Web component of Junos OS that could be combined to achieve remote code execution on susceptible installations. The four vulnerabilities have a cumulative CVSS rating of 9.8, making them Critical in severity. They affect all versions of Junos OS on SRX and EX Series. "By chaining exploitation of these vulnerabilities, an unauthenticated, network-based attacker may be able to remotely execute code on the devices," the company  said  in an advisory released on August 17, 2023. The J-Web interface allows users to configure, manage, and monitor Junos OS devices. A brief description of the flaws is as follows - CVE-2023-36844  and  CVE-2023-36845  (CVSS scores: 5.3) - Two PHP external variable modification vulnerabilities in J-Web of Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX Series and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to

Thousands of Android Malware Apps Using Stealthy APK Compression to Evade Detection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/thousands-of-android-malware-apps-using.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are using Android Package (APK) files with unknown or unsupported compression methods to elude malware analysis. That's according to findings from Zimperium, which found 3,300 artifacts leveraging such compression algorithms in the wild. 71 of the identified samples can be loaded on the operating system without any problems. There is no evidence that the apps were available on the Google Play Store at any point in time, indicating that the apps were distributed through other means, typically via untrusted app stores or social engineering to trick the victims into sideloading them. The APK files use "a technique that limits the possibility of decompiling the application for a large number of tools, reducing the possibilities of being analyzed," security researcher Fernando Ortega  said . "In order to do that, the APK (which is in essence a ZIP file), is using an unsupported decompression method." The advantage of such an approach is its abilit

14 Suspected Cybercriminals Arrested Across Africa in Coordinated Crackdown<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/14-suspected-cybercriminals-arrested.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coordinated law enforcement operation across 25 African countries has led to the arrest of 14 suspected cybercriminals, INTERPOL  announced  Friday. The exercise, conducted in partnership with AFRIPOL, enabled investigators to identify 20,674 cyber networks that were linked to financial losses of more than $40 million. "The four-month Africa Cyber Surge II operation was launched in April 2023 and focused on identifying cybercriminals and compromised infrastructure," the agency said. As part of the operation, three suspects were arrested in Cameroon in connection with an online scam involving the fraudulent sale of works of art worth $850,000. Another suspect was arrested in Nigeria for defrauding a Gambian victim. Also arrested were two money mules linked to scams initiated through messaging platforms. The cyber networks comprised 3,786 command-and-control (C2) servers, 14,134 victim IP addresses tied to data stealer infections, 1,415 phishing links and domains, 939

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
While IT security managers in companies and public administrations rely on the concept of Zero Trust, APTS (Advanced Persistent Threats) are putting its practical effectiveness to the test. Analysts, on the other hand, understand that Zero Trust can only be achieved with comprehensive insight into one's own network.  Just recently, an attack believed to be perpetrated by the Chinese hacker group  Storm-0558  targeted several government agencies. They used fake digital authentication tokens to access webmail accounts running on Microsoft's Outlook service. In this incident, the attackers stole a signing key from Microsoft, enabling them to issue functional access tokens for Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Outlook.com and to download emails and attachments. Due to a plausibility check error, the digital signature, which was only intended for private customer accounts (MSA), also worked in the Azure Active Directory for business customers.  Embracing the Zero Trust Revolution Acc

A new "mass-spreading" social engineering campaign is targeting users of the Zimbra Collaboration email server with an aim to collect their login credentials for use in follow-on operations. The activity, active since April 2023 and still ongoing, targets a wide range of small and medium businesses and governmental entities, most of which are located in Poland, Ecuador, Mexico, Italy, and Russia. It has not been attributed to any known threat actor or group. "Initially, the target receives an email with a phishing page in the attached HTML file," ESET researcher Viktor Šperka  said  in a report. "The email warns the target about an email server update, account deactivation, or similar issue and directs the user to click on the attached file."

Microsoft on Thursday disclosed that it found a new version of the  BlackCat  ransomware (aka ALPHV and Noberus) that embeds tools like Impacket and RemCom to facilitate lateral movement and remote code execution. "The  Impacket tool  has credential dumping and remote service execution modules that could be used for broad deployment of the BlackCat ransomware in target environments," the company's threat intelligence team  said  in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). "This BlackCat version also has the  RemCom hacktool  embedded in the executable for remote code execution. The file also contains hardcoded compromised target credentials that actors use for lateral movement and further ransomware deployment." RemCom, billed as an open-source alternative to PsExec, has been put to use by Chinese and Iranian nation-state threat actors like  Dalbit  and  Chafer  (aka Remix Kitten) to move across the victim environments in the past.

Google has announced plans to add a new feature in the upcoming version of its Chrome web browser to alert users when an extension they have installed has been removed from the Chrome Web Store. The feature, set for release alongside Chrome 117, allows users to be notified when an add-on has been unpublished by a developer, taken down for violating Chrome Web Store policy, or marked as malware. The tech giant said it intends to highlight such extensions under a "Safety check" category in the "Privacy and security" section of the browser settings page. "When a user clicks 'Review,' they will be taken to their extensions and given the choice to either remove the extension or hide the warning if they wish to keep the extension installed," Oliver Dunk, a developer relations engineer for Chrome extensions,  said .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undetected attack method called  NoFilter  has been found to abuse the Windows Filtering Platform ( WFP ) to achieve privilege escalation in the Windows operating system. "If an attacker has the ability to execute code with admin privilege and the target is to perform  LSASS Shtinkering , these privileges are not enough," Ron Ben Yizhak, a security researcher at Deep Instinct, told The Hacker News. "Running as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" is required. The techniques described in this research can escalate from admin to SYSTEM." The  findings  were presented at the DEF CON security conference over the weekend. The starting point of the  research  is an in-house tool called RPC Mapper the cybersecurity company used to map remote procedure call ( RPC ) methods, specifically those that invoke  WinAPI , leading to the discovery of a method named "BfeRpcOpenToken," which is part of WFP. WFP is a  set of API and system services  that's

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing cyber attack campaign originating from China is targeting the Southeast Asian gambling sector to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons on compromised systems.  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne said the tactics, techniques, and procedures point to the involvement of a threat actor tracked as  Bronze Starlight  (aka Emperor Dragonfly or Storm-0401), which has been linked to the use of  short-lived   ransomware families  as a smokescreen to conceal its espionage motives. "The threat actors abuse Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Edge, and McAfee VirusScan executables vulnerable to DLL hijacking to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons," security researchers Aleksandar Milenkoski and Tom Hegel  said  in an analysis published today. It also bears noting that the campaign exhibits overlaps with an intrusion set monitored by ESET under the name  Operation ChattyGoblin .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have documented a novel post-exploit persistence technique on iOS 16 that could be abused to fly under the radar and maintain access to an Apple device even when the victim believes it is offline. The method "tricks the victim into thinking their device's Airplane Mode works when in reality the attacker (following successful device exploit) has planted an artificial Airplane Mode which edits the UI to display Airplane Mode icon and cuts internet connection to all apps except the attacker application," Jamf Threat Labs researchers Hu Ke and Nir Avraham said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Airplane Mode , as the name implies, allows users to turn off wireless features in their devices, effectively preventing them from connecting to Wi-Fi networks, cellular data, and Bluetooth as well as sending or receiving calls and text messages. The approach devised by Jamf, in a nutshell, provides an illusion to the user that the Airplane Mode is

New LABRAT Campaign Exploits GitLab Flaw for Cryptojacking and Proxyjacking Activities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-labrat-campaign-exploits-gitlab.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new, financially motivated operation dubbed  LABRAT  has been observed weaponizing a now-patched critical flaw in GitLab as part of a cryptojacking and proxyjacking campaign. "The attacker utilized undetected signature-based tools, sophisticated and stealthy cross-platform malware, command-and-control (C2) tools which bypassed firewalls, and kernel-based rootkits to hide their presence," Sysdig  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Furthermore, the attacker abused a legitimate service,  TryCloudflare , to obfuscate their C2 network." Proxyjacking  allows the attacker to rent the compromised host out to a proxy network, making it possible to monetize the unused bandwidth. Cryptojacking, on the other hand, refers to the abuse of the system resources to mine cryptocurrency. A notable aspect of the campaign is the use of compiled binaries written in Go and .NET to fly under the radar, with LABRAT also providing backdoor access to the infected systems.

An ongoing campaign targeting ministries of foreign affairs of NATO-aligned countries points to the involvement of Russian threat actors. The phishing attacks feature PDF documents with diplomatic lures, some of which are disguised as coming from Germany, to deliver a variant of a malware called  Duke , which has been attributed to  APT29  (aka BlueBravo, Cloaked Ursa, Cozy Bear, Iron Hemlock, Midnight Blizzard, and The Dukes). "The threat actor used Zulip – an open-source chat application – for command-and-control, to evade and hide its activities behind legitimate web traffic," Dutch cybersecurity company EclecticIQ  said  in an analysis last week. The infection sequence is as follows: The PDF attachment, named "Farewell to Ambassador of Germany," comes embedded with JavaScript code that initiates a multi-stage process to leave a persistent backdoor on compromised networks.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical security flaw in Citrix ShareFile storage zones controller to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, based on evidence of active in-the-wild exploitation. Tracked as  CVE-2023-24489  (CVSS score: 9.8), the shortcoming has been described as an improper access control bug that, if successfully exploited, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to compromise vulnerable instances remotely. The problem is rooted in ShareFile's handling of cryptographic operations, enabling adversaries to upload arbitrary files, resulting in remote code execution. "This vulnerability affects all currently supported versions of customer-managed ShareFile storage zones controller before version 5.11.24," Citrix  said  in an advisory released in June. Dylan Pindur of Assetnote has been credited with discovering and reporting the issue. It's worth noting that the  first signs of exploitatio

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
At a little overt halfway through 2023, credential theft is still a major thorn in the side of IT teams. The heart of the problem is the value of data to cybercriminals and the evolution of the techniques they use to get hold of it. The  2023 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)  revealed that 83% of breaches involved external actors, with almost all attacks being financially motivated. Of these breaches by external actors, 49% involved the use of stolen credentials.  We'll explore why credential theft is still such an attractive (and successful) attack route, and look at how IT security teams can fight back in the second half of 2023 and beyond. Users are still often the weak link The hallmarks of many successful cyberattacks are the determination, inventiveness, and patience threat actors show. Though a user may spot some attacks through security and awareness training, it only takes one well-crafted attack to catch them. Sometimes all it takes is for a user to be

Active flaws in the PowerShell Gallery could be weaponized by threat actors to pull off supply chain attacks against the registry's users. "These flaws make typosquatting attacks inevitable in this registry, while also making it extremely difficult for users to identify the true owner of a package," Aqua security researchers Mor Weinberger, Yakir Kadkoda, and Ilay Goldman said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Maintained by Microsoft,  PowerShell Gallery  is a  central repository  for sharing and acquiring PowerShell code, including PowerShell modules, scripts, and Desired State Configuration (DSC) resources. The registry boasts 11,829 unique packages and 244,615 packages in total. The issues identified by the cloud security firm have to do with the service's lax policy surrounding package names, lacking protections against typosquatting attacks, as a result enabling attackers to upload malicious PowerShell modules that appear genuine to unsuspecting users

More and more organizations are choosing Google Workspace as their default employee toolset of choice.

Security teams now have to find a way to adjust their security architecture to this new cloud workload. Some teams may rely on their existing network security solutions. According to a  new guide , this is a hit and a miss. Network solutions, the guide claims, just don't cover all SaaS and browsing requirements. Meanwhile, Google offers a wide range of native security functionalities built-in to Chrome. These functionalities enable the organization to leverage the browser for consolidating security, simplifying operations and reducing costs. If you're wary about trusting Chrome with your security, then the guide is recommended to read. In great detail, it explains which security features Chrome offers users.

Google Introduces First Quantum Resilient FIDO2 Security Key<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/google-introduces-first-quantum.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday announced the first quantum resilient FIDO2 security key implementation as part of its OpenSK security keys initiative. "This open-source hardware optimized implementation uses a novel ECC/Dilithium hybrid signature schema that benefits from the security of ECC against standard attacks and Dilithium's resilience against quantum attacks," Elie Bursztein and Fabian Kaczmarczyck  said . OpenSK  is an open-source implementation for security keys written in Rust that supports both FIDO U2F and FIDO2 standards. The development comes less than a week after the tech giant  said  it plans to add support for quantum-resistant encryption algorithms in Chrome 116 to set up symmetric keys in TLS connections. It's also part of broader efforts to switch to cryptographic algorithms that can withstand quantum attacks in the future, necessitating the need to incorporate such technologies early on to facilitate a gradual rollout.

Multiple critical security flaws have been reported in  Ivanti Avalanche , an enterprise mobile device management solution that's used by 30,000 organizations. The vulnerabilities, collectively tracked as  CVE-2023-32560  (CVSS score: 9.8), are stack-based buffer overflows in Ivanti Avalanche WLAvanacheServer.exe v6.4.0.0. Cybersecurity company Tenable  said  the shortcomings are the result of buffer overflows arising as a consequence of processing specific data types. An unauthenticated remote attacker can specify a long hex string or long type 9 item to overflow the buffer, it noted. Successful exploitation of both issues could be exploited by a remote adversary to achieve code execution or a system crash. Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities  occur when  the buffer being overwritten is in the stack, leading to a scenario where program execution can be altered to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Ivanti has released  Avalanche version 6.4.1  to remediate the

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Nearly 2,000 Citrix NetScaler instances have been compromised with a backdoor by weaponizing a recently disclosed critical security vulnerability as part of a large-scale attack. "An adversary appears to have exploited CVE-2023-3519 in an automated fashion, placing web shells on vulnerable NetScalers to gain persistent access," NCC Group  said  in an advisory released Tuesday. "The adversary can execute arbitrary commands with this webshell, even when a NetScaler is patched and/or rebooted." CVE-2023-3519 refers to a critical code injection vulnerability impacting NetScaler ADC and Gateway servers that could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. It was patched by Citrix last month. The development comes a week after the Shadowserver Foundation  said  it identified close to 7,000 vulnerable, unpatched NetScaler ADC and Gateway instances online and the flaw is being abused to drop PHP web shells on vulnerable servers for remote access.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors' use of Cloudflare R2 to host phishing pages has witnessed a 61-fold increase over the past six months. "The majority of the phishing campaigns target Microsoft login credentials, although there are some pages targeting Adobe, Dropbox, and other cloud apps," Netskope security researcher Jan Michael  said . Cloudflare R2 , analogous to Amazon Web Service S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage, is a data storage service for the cloud. The development comes as the total number of cloud apps from which malware downloads originate has  increased to 167 , with Microsoft OneDrive, Squarespace, GitHub, SharePoint, and Weebly taking the top five spots. The phishing campaigns identified by Netskope not only abuse Cloudflare R2 to distribute static phishing pages, but also leverage the company's  Turnstile  offering, a CAPTCHA replacement, to place such pages behind anti-bot barriers to evade detection. In doing so, it prevents online scanners like

The threat actors behind the Monti ransomware have resurfaced after a two-month break with a new Linux version of the encryptor in its attacks targeting government and legal sectors. Monti  emerged  in June 2022, weeks after the Conti ransomware group shut down its operations, deliberately imitating the tactics and tools associated with the latter, including its leaked source code. Not anymore. The new version, per Trend Micro, is a departure of sorts, exhibiting significant changes from its other Linux-based predecessors. "Unlike the earlier variant, which is primarily based on the leaked Conti source code, this new version employs a different encryptor with additional distinct behaviors," Trend Micro researchers Nathaniel Morales and Joshua Paul Ignacio  said . A  BinDiff analysis  has revealed that while the older iterations had a 99% similarity rate with Conti, the latest version has only a 29% similarity rate, suggesting an overhaul.

Account holders of over numerous financial institutions in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Peru are being targeted by an Android banking malware called  Gigabud RAT . "One of Gigabud RAT's unique features is that it doesn't execute any malicious actions until the user is authorized into the malicious application by a fraudster, [...] which makes it harder to detect," Group-IB researchers Pavel Naumov and Artem Grischenko  said . "Instead of using HTML overlay attacks, Gigabud RAT gathers sensitive information primarily through screen recording." Gigabud RAT was  first documented  by Cyble in January 2023 after it was spotted impersonating bank and government apps to siphon sensitive data. It's known to be active in the wild since at least July 2022. The Singapore-based company said it also identified a second variant of the malware minus the RAT capabilities.

The npm package registry has emerged as the target of yet another highly targeted attack campaign that aims to entice developers into downloading malevolent modules. Software supply chain security firm Phylum told The Hacker News the activity exhibits similar behaviors to that of a previous attack wave  uncovered in June , which has since been  linked to North Korean threat actors . As many as nine packages have been identified as uploaded to npm between August 9 and 12, 2023. This includes: ws-paso-jssdk, pingan-vue-floating, srm-front-util, cloud-room-video, progress-player, ynf-core-loader, ynf-core-renderer, ynf-dx-scripts, and ynf-dx-webpack-plugins. "Due to the sophisticated nature of the attack and the small number of affected packages, we suspect this is another highly targeted attack, likely with a social engineering aspect involved in order to get targets to install these packages," the company  said . The attack chain commences with the package.json file with

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new remote access trojan (RAT) called  QwixxRAT  is being advertised for sale by its threat actor through Telegram and Discord platforms. "Once installed on the victim's Windows platform machines, the RAT stealthily collects sensitive data, which is then sent to the attacker's Telegram bot, providing them with unauthorized access to the victim's sensitive information," Uptycs  said  in a new report published today. The cybersecurity company, which discovered the malware earlier this month, said it's "meticulously designed" to harvest web browser histories, bookmarks, cookies, credit card information, keystrokes, screenshots, files matching certain extensions, and data from apps like Steam and Telegram. The tool is offered for 150 rubles for weekly access and 500 rubles for a lifetime license. It also comes in a limited free version. A C#-based binary, QwixxRAT comes with various anti-analysis features to remain covert and evade detection. Thi

E-commerce sites using Adobe's Magento 2 software are the target of an ongoing campaign that has been active since at least January 2023. The attacks, dubbed  Xurum  by Akamai, leverage a now-patched critical security flaw ( CVE-2022-24086 , CVSS score: 9.8) in Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source that, if successfully exploited, could lead to arbitrary code execution. "The attacker seems to be interested in payment stats from the orders in the victim's Magento store placed in the past 10 days," Akamai researchers  said  in an analysis published last week, attributing the campaign to actors of Russian origin. Some of the websites have also been observed to be infected with simple JavaScript-based skimmers that's designed to collect credit card information and transmit it to a remote server. The exact scale of the campaign remains unclear. In the attack chains observed by the company, CVE-2022-24086 is weaponized for initial access, subsequently exploiting

Why SaaS Security Is a Challenge In today's digital landscape, organizations are increasingly relying on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications to drive their operations. However, this widespread adoption has also opened the doors to new security risks and vulnerabilities. The SaaS security attack surface continues to widen. It started with managing misconfigurations and now requires a holistic approach to handling the entire SaaS ecosystem. This includes the continuous monitoring and management of user access, roles and permissions, 3rd party apps installed by users, risks deriving from SaaS user devices and Identity Threat Detection & Response (ITDR). There are a variety of reasons that SaaS security is so complex today. Firstly, there are a diverse range of applications, each having its own UI and terminology. And those environments are dynamic, from SaaS vendors understanding the importance of security and continually enhancing their applications with modern security

Germany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) has warned of cyber attacks targeting Iranian persons and organizations in the country since the end of 2022. "The cyber attacks were mainly directed against dissident organizations and individuals – such as lawyers, journalists, or human rights activists – inside and outside Iran," the agency  said  in an advisory. The intrusions have been attributed to a threat actor called  Charming Kitten , which is also tracked under the names APT35, Mint Sandstorm, TA453 and Yellow Garuda. While Iranian nation-state actors lag behind their Russian and Chinese counterparts in sophistication, they have demonstrated a continued advancement of tools and techniques, adding an arsenal of custom malware to facilitate information gathering and rapidly exploiting n-day security flaws to obtain initial access.

Users in Latin America (LATAM) are the target of a financial malware called  JanelaRAT  that's capable of capturing sensitive information from compromised Microsoft Windows systems. "JanelaRAT mainly targets financial and cryptocurrency data from LATAM bank and financial institutions," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Gaetano Pellegrino and Sudeep Singh  said , adding it "abuses DLL side-loading techniques from legitimate sources (like VMWare and Microsoft) to evade endpoint detection." The exact starting point of the infection chain is unclear, but the cybersecurity company, which discovered the campaign in June 2023, said the unknown vector is used to deliver a ZIP archive file containing a Visual Basic Script. The VBScript is engineered to fetch a second ZIP archive from the attackers' server as well as drop a batch file used to establish persistence of the malware.

Zoom ZTP & AudioCodes Phones Flaws Uncovered, Exposing Users to Eavesdropping<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/zoom-ztp-audiocodes-phones-flaws.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in AudioCodes desk phones and Zoom's Zero Touch Provisioning ( ZTP ) that could be potentially exploited by a malicious attacker to conduct remote attacks. "An external attacker who leverages the vulnerabilities discovered in AudioCodes Ltd.'s desk phones and Zoom's Zero Touch Provisioning feature can gain full remote control of the devices," SySS security researcher Moritz Abrell  said  in an analysis published Friday. The unfettered access could then be weaponized to eavesdrop on rooms or phone calls, pivot through the devices and attack corporate networks, and even build a botnet of infected devices. The research was  presented  at the Black Hat USA security conference earlier this week. The problems are rooted in Zoom's ZTP, which allows IT administrators to configure VoIP devices in a centralized manner such that it makes it easy for organizations to monitor, troubleshoot and update the devices as

European and U.S. law enforcement agencies have announced the dismantling of a bulletproof hosting service provider called  Lolek Hosted , which cybercriminals have used to launch cyber-attacks across the globe. "Five of its administrators were arrested, and all of its servers seized, rendering LolekHosted.net no longer available," Europol  said  in a statement. "The service facilitated the distribution of information-stealing malware, and also the launching of DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks, fictitious online shops, botnet server management, and distribution of spam messages worldwide," it added. Polish authorities, who made the arrests,  said  three other detainees have been subjected to preventive measures in the form of police supervision, bail, and a ban on leaving the country. Alongside the arrests, hundreds of servers containing terabytes of data, computer equipment, and mobile phones have been confiscated. The seizure, carried out on Augu

New Python URL Parsing Flaw Could Enable Command Execution Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-python-url-parsing-flaw-enables.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A high-severity security flaw has been disclosed in the Python URL parsing function that could be exploited to bypass domain or protocol filtering methods implemented with a blocklist, ultimately resulting in arbitrary file reads and command execution. "urlparse has a parsing problem when the entire URL starts with blank characters," the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) said in a Friday advisory. "This problem affects both the parsing of hostname and scheme, and eventually causes any blocklisting methods to fail." The flaw has been assigned the identifier  CVE-2023-24329  and carries a CVSS score of 7.5. Security researcher Yebo Cao has been credited with discovering and reporting the issue in August 2022. It has been addressed in the following versions - >= 3.12 3.11.x >= 3.11.4 3.10.x >= 3.10.12 3.9.x >= 3.9.17 3.8.x >= 3.8.17, and  3.7.x >= 3.7.17 urllib.parse  is a widely used parsing function that makes it possible to break dow

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hitherto undocumented threat actor operating for nearly a decade and codenamed  MoustachedBouncer has been attributed to cyber espionage attacks aimed at foreign embassies in Belarus. "Since 2020, MoustachedBouncer has most likely been able to perform adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks at the ISP level, within Belarus, in order to compromise its targets," ESET security researcher Matthieu Faou  said , describing the group as skilled and advanced. The adversary, active since at least 2014, is assessed to be aligned with Belarusian interests, likely employing a lawful interception system such as  SORM  to conduct its AitM attacks as well as deploy disparate tools called NightClub and Disco. Both the Windows malware frameworks support additional spying plugins including a screenshotter, an audio recorder, and a file stealer. The oldest sample of NightClub dates back to November 19, 2014, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal from Ukraine. Embassy staff from four differ

Google has announced plans to add support for quantum-resistant encryption algorithms in its Chrome browser, starting with version 116. "Chrome will begin supporting  X25519Kyber768  for establishing symmetric secrets in  TLS , starting in Chrome 116, and available behind a flag in Chrome 115," Devon O'Brien  said  in a post published Thursday. Kyber was  chosen  by the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the candidate for general encryption in a bid to tackle future cyber attacks posed by the advent of quantum computing.  Kyber-768  is roughly the security equivalent of  AES-192 . The encryption algorithm has already been adopted by  Cloudflare ,  Amazon Web Services , and IBM. X25519Kyber768 is a hybrid algorithm that combines the output of  X25519 , an elliptic curve algorithm widely used for key agreement in TLS, and Kyber-768 to create a strong session key to encrypt TLS connections.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Chinese threat actor known as APT31 (aka Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, or Violet Typhoon) has been linked to a set of advanced backdoors that are capable of exfiltrating harvested sensitive information to Dropbox. The malware is part of a broader collection of  more than 15 implants  that have been put to use by the adversary in attacks targeting industrial organizations in Eastern Europe in 2022. "The attackers aimed to establish a permanent channel for data exfiltration, including data stored on air-gapped systems," Kaspersky  said  in an analysis spotlighting APT31's previously undocumented tradecraft. The intrusions employ a three-stage malware stack, each focused on disparate aspects of the attack chain: setting up persistence, gathering sensitive data, and transmitting the information to a remote server under the threat actor's control. Some variants of the second-stage backdoors also come with features designed to look up file names in the Microso

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been linked to a cyber attack on a power generation company in southern Africa with a new variant of the SystemBC malware called DroxiDat as a precursor to a suspected ransomware attack. "The proxy-capable backdoor was deployed alongside Cobalt Strike Beacons in a south African nation's critical infrastructure," Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT),  said . The Russian cybersecurity company said the attack, which took place in late March 2023, was in its early stages and involved the use of DroxiDat to profile the system and proxy network traffic using the  SOCKS5 protocol  to and from command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. SystemBC  is a C/C++-based commodity malware and remote administrative tool that was  first seen in 2019 . Its main feature is to set up  SOCKS5 proxies  on victim computers that can then be used by threat actors to tunnel malicious traffic associ

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has  added  a recently patched security flaw in Microsoft's .NET and Visual Studio products to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. Tracked as  CVE-2023-38180  (CVSS score: 7.5), the high-severity flaw relates to a case denial-of-service (DoS) impacting .NET and Visual Studio. It was  addressed  by Microsoft as part of its August 2023 Patch Tuesday updates shipped earlier this week, tagging it with an "Exploitation More Likely" assessment. While exact details surrounding the nature of exploitation are unclear, the Windows maker has acknowledged the existence of a proof-of-concept (PoC) in its advisory. It also said that attacks leveraging the flaw can be pulled off without any additional privileges or user interaction. "Proof-of-concept exploit code is available, or an attack demonstration is not practical for most systems," the company

New Attack Alert: Freeze[.]rs Injector Weaponized for XWorm Malware Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-attack-alert-freezers-injector.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors are using a legitimate Rust-based injector called  Freeze[.]rs  to deploy a commodity malware called XWorm in victim environments. The novel attack chain, detected by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs on July 13, 2023, is initiated via a phishing email containing a booby-trapped PDF file. It has also been used to introduce Remcos RAT by means of a crypter called SYK Crypter, which was first documented by Morphisec in May 2022. "This file redirects to an HTML file and utilizes the 'search-ms' protocol to access an LNK file on a remote server," security researcher Cara Lin  said . "Upon clicking the LNK file, a PowerShell script executes Freeze[.]rs and SYK Crypter for further offensive actions." Freeze[.]rs, released on May 4, 2023, is a  open-source red teaming tool  from Optiv that functions as a payload creation tool used for circumventing security solutions and executing shellcode in a stealthy manner. "Freeze[.]rs utilizes multiple tec

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new information malware strain called  Statc Stealer  has been found infecting devices running Microsoft Windows to siphon sensitive personal and payment information. "Statc Stealer exhibits a broad range of stealing capabilities, making it a significant threat," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Shivam Sharma and Amandeep Kumar  said  in a technical report published this week. "It can steal sensitive information from various web browsers, including login data, cookies, web data, and preferences. Additionally, it targets cryptocurrency wallets, credentials, passwords, and even data from messaging apps like Telegram." Written in C++, the malicious stealer finds its way into victim systems when potential victims are tricked into clicking on seemingly innocuous ads, with the stealer imitating an MP4 video file format on web browsers like Google Chrome. The first-stage payload, while dropping and executing a decoy PDF installer, also stealthily deploys a downloader

Attackers continue to target Microsoft identities to gain access to connected Microsoft applications and federated SaaS applications. Additionally, attackers continue to progress their attacks in these environments, not by exploiting vulnerabilities, but by abusing native Microsoft functionality to achieve their objective. The attacker group Nobelium, linked with the SolarWinds attacks, has been documented using native functionality like the creation of Federated Trusts  [1]  to enable persistent access to a Microsoft tenant. This article demonstrates an additional native functionality that when leveraged by an attacker enables persistent access to a Microsoft cloud tenant and lateral movement capabilities to another tenant. This attack vector enables an attacker operating in a compromised tenant to abuse a misconfigured Cross-Tenant Synchronization (CTS) configuration and gain access to other connected tenants or deploy a rogue CTS configuration to maintain persistence within the te

A widely used Chinese language input app for Windows and Android has been found vulnerable to serious security flaws that could allow a malicious interloper to decipher the text typed by users. The findings from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which carried out an analysis of the encryption mechanism used in Tencent's Sogou Input Method , an app that has over 455 million monthly active users across Windows, Android, and iOS. The vulnerabilities are rooted in EncryptWall, the service's custom encryption system, allowing network eavesdroppers to extract the textual content and access sensitive data. "The Windows and Android versions of Sogou Input Method contain vulnerabilities in this encryption system, including a vulnerability to a CBC  padding oracle attack , which allow network eavesdroppers to recover the plaintext of encrypted network transmissions, revealing sensitive information including what users have typed," the researchers  said .

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are increasingly using a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit dubbed EvilProxy to pull off account takeover attacks aimed at high-ranking executives at prominent companies. According to Proofpoint, an ongoing hybrid campaign has leveraged the service to target thousands of Microsoft 365 user accounts, sending approximately 120,000 phishing emails to hundreds of organizations worldwide between March and June 2023. Nearly 39% of the hundreds of compromised users are said to be C-level executives, including CEOs (9%) and CFOs (17%). The attacks have also singled out personnel with access to financial assets or sensitive information. At least 35% of all compromised users had additional account protections enabled. The campaigns are seen as a response to the increased adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in enterprises, prompting threat actors to evolve their tactics to bypass new security layers by incorporating adversary-in-the-middle ( AitM ) phishing kits to

Interpol has announced the takedown of a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform called 16Shop, in addition to the arrests of three individuals in Indonesia and Japan. 16Shop specialized in the sales of phishing kits that other cybercriminals can purchase to mount phishing attacks on a large scale, ultimately facilitating the theft of credentials and payment details from users of popular services such as Apple, PayPal, American Express, Amazon, and Cash App, among others. "Victims typically receive an email with a pdf file or link that redirects to a site requesting the victims' credit card or other personally identifiable information," Interpol  said . "This information is then stolen and used to extract money from the victims." No less than 70,000 users across 43 countries are estimated to have been compromised via services offered on 16Shop. The law enforcement operation has also led to the arrest of the site's administrator, a 21-year-old Indonesian

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a trio of side-channel attacks that could be exploited to leak sensitive data from modern CPUs. Called  Collide+Power  ( CVE-2023-20583 ),  Downfall  ( CVE-2022-40982 ), and  Inception  ( CVE-2023-20569 ), the novel methods follow the disclosure of another newly discovered security vulnerability affecting AMD's Zen 2 architecture-based processors known as  Zenbleed  (CVE-2023-20593). "Downfall attacks target a critical weakness found in billions of modern processors used in personal and cloud computers,"  Daniel Moghimi , senior research scientist at Google,  said . "This vulnerability [...] enables a user to access and steal data from other users who share the same computer." In a hypothetical attack scenario, a malicious app installed on a device could weaponize the method to steal sensitive information like passwords and encryption keys, effectively undermining Intel's Software Guard eXtensions ( SGX

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Hackers associated with China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) have been linked to attacks in 17 different countries in Asia, Europe, and North America from 2021 to 2023. Cybersecurity firm Recorded Future attributed the intrusion set to a nation-state group it tracks under the name  RedHotel  (previously Threat Activity Group-22 or TAG-22), which overlaps with a cluster of activity broadly monitored as  Aquatic Panda ,  Bronze University , Charcoal Typhoon,  Earth Lusca , and  Red Scylla  (or Red Dev 10). Active since 2019, some of the prominent sectors targeted by the prolific actor encompass academia, aerospace, government, media, telecommunications, and research. A majority of the victims during the period were government organizations. "RedHotel has a dual mission of intelligence gathering and economic espionage," the cybersecurity company  said , calling out its persistence, operational intensity, and global reach. "It targets both government entities for

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Validate security continuously across your full stack with Pen Testing as a Service. In today's modern security operations center (SOC), it's a battle between the defenders and the cybercriminals. Both are using tools and expertise – however, the cybercriminals have the element of surprise on their side, and a host of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that have evolved. These external threat actors have now been further emboldened in the era of AI with open-source tools like ChatGPT. With the potential of an attack leading to a breach within minutes, CISOs now are looking to prepare all systems and assets for cyber resilience and rapid response when needed. With tools and capabilities to validate security continuously – including penetration testing as a service – DevSecOps teams can remediate critical vulnerabilities fast due to the easy access to tactical support to the teams that need it the most. This gives the SOC and DevOps teams tools to that remove false po

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has introduced a new security feature in Android 14 that allows IT administrators to disable support for 2G cellular networks in their managed device fleet. The search giant said it's introducing a second user setting to turn off support, at the model level, for  null-ciphered cellular connections . "The Android Security Model assumes that all networks are hostile to keep users safe from network packet injection, tampering, or eavesdropping on user traffic," Roger Piqueras Jover, Yomna Nasser, and Sudhi Herle  said . "Android does not rely on link-layer encryption to address this threat model. Instead, Android establishes that all network traffic should be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)." 2G networks, in particular, employ weak encryption and lack mutual authentication,  rendering  them  susceptible  to over-the-air interception and traffic decryption attacks by impersonating a real 2G tower. The  threat posed by rogue cellular base stations  means th

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.K. Electoral Commission on Tuesday disclosed a "complex" cyber attack on its systems that went undetected for over a year, allowing the threat actors to access years worth of voter data belonging to 40 million people. "The incident was identified in October 2022 after suspicious activity was detected on our systems," the regulator  said . "It became clear that hostile actors had first accessed the systems in August 2021." The intrusion enabled unauthorized access to the Commission's servers hosting email, control systems, and copies of the electoral registers it maintains for research purposes. The identity of the intruders are presently unknown. The registers included the name and address of anyone in the U.K. who registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, as well as the names of those registered as overseas voters. However, they did not contain information of those who qualified to register anonymously and addresses of overseas electors regi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Exposed Kubernetes (K8s) clusters are being exploited by malicious actors to deploy cryptocurrency miners and other backdoors. Cloud security firm Aqua, in a  report  shared with The Hacker News, said a majority of the clusters belonged to small to medium-sized organizations, with a smaller subset tied to bigger companies, spanning financial, aerospace, automotive, industrial, and security sectors. In total, Kubernetes clusters belonging to more than 350 organizations, open-source projects, and individuals were discovered, 60% of which were the target of an active crypto-mining campaign. The publicly-accessible clusters, per Aqua, are said to suffer from two different kinds of misconfigurations: allowing anonymous access with high privileges and running kubectl proxy with the flags "--address=`0.0.0.0` --accept-hosts `.*`" "Housing a wide array of sensitive and valuable assets, Kubernetes clusters can store customer data, financial records, intellectual property, a

Tactical similarities have been unearthed between the double extortion ransomware group known as Rhysida and Vice Society , including in their targeting of education and healthcare sectors. "As Vice Society was observed deploying a variety of commodity ransomware payloads, this link does not suggest that Rhysida is exclusively used by Vice Society, but shows with at least medium confidence that Vice Society operators are now using Rhysida ransomware," Check Point  said  in a new report. Vice Society , tracked by Microsoft under the name Storm-0832, has a  pattern  of employing already existing ransomware binaries that are sold on criminal forums to pull off their attacks. The financially motivated gang has also been observed resorting to pure extortion-themed attacks wherein the data is exfiltrated without encrypting them. First observed in May 2023, the  Rhysida  ransomware group is known to rely on phishing attacks and Cobalt Strike to breach targets' networks and

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators associated with the QakBot (aka QBot) malware have set up 15 new command-and-control (C2) servers as of late June 2023. The findings are a continuation of the malware's infrastructure analysis from Team Cymru, and arrive a little over two months after Lumen Black Lotus Labs  revealed  that 25% of its C2 servers are only active for a single day. "QakBot has a history of taking an extended break each summer before returning sometime in September, with this year's spamming activities ceasing around 22 June 2023," the cybersecurity firm  said . "But are the QakBot operators actually on vacation when they aren't spamming, or is this 'break' a time for them to refine and update their infrastructure and tools?" QakBot's C2 network, like in the case of Emotet and IcedID, is  characterized  by a tiered architecture in which C2 nodes communicate with upstream Tier 2 (T2) C2 nodes hosted on VPS providers geolocated in Russia.

Hackers Abusing Cloudflare Tunnels for Covert Communications<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/hackers-abusing-cloudflare-tunnels-for.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has revealed that threat actors are abusing Cloudflare Tunnels to establish covert communication channels from compromised hosts and retain persistent access. "Cloudflared is functionally very similar to ngrok," Nic Finn, a senior threat intelligence analyst at GuidePoint Security, said . "However, Cloudflared differs from ngrok in that it provides a lot more usability for free, including the ability to host TCP connectivity over cloudflared." A command-line tool for Cloudflare Tunnel, cloudflared allows users to create secure connections between an origin web server and Cloudflare's nearest data center so as to hide the web server IP addresses as well as block volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and brute-force login attacks. For a threat actor with elevated access on an infected host, this feature presents a lucrative approach to set up a foothold by generating a token required to establish the tunnel from the victim machine.

Introduced in 1999, Microsoft Active Directory is the default identity and access management service in Windows networks, responsible for assigning and enforcing security policies for all network endpoints. With it, users can access various resources across networks. As things tend to do, times, they are a'changin' – and a few years back, Microsoft introduced Azure Active Directory, the cloud-based version of AD to extend the AD paradigm, providing organizations with an Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solution across both the cloud and on-prem apps. (Note that as of July 11th 2023, this service was renamed to  Microsoft Entra ID , but for the sake of simplicity, we'll refer to it as Azure AD in this post) Both Active Directory and Azure AD are critical to the functioning of on-prem, cloud-based, and hybrid ecosystems, playing a key role in uptime and business continuity. And with 90% of organizations using the service for employee authentication, access control and ID manag

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor is using a variant of the Yashma ransomware to target various entities in English-speaking countries, Bulgaria, China, and Vietnam at least since June 4, 2023. Cisco Talos, in a new write-up, attributed the operation with moderate confidence to an adversary of likely Vietnamese origin. "The threat actor uses an uncommon technique to deliver the ransom note," security researcher Chetan Raghuprasad  said . "Instead of embedding the ransom note strings in the binary, they download the ransom note from the actor-controlled GitHub repository by executing an embedded batch file." Yashma,  first described  by the BlackBerry research and intelligence team in May 2022, is a rebranded version of another ransomware strain called Chaos. A month prior to its emergence, the Chaos ransomware builder was leaked in the wild. A notable aspect of the ransom note is its resemblance to the well-known WannaCry ransomware, possibly done so in an attempt to obs

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a set of 11 living-off-the-land binaries-and-scripts ( LOLBAS ) that could be maliciously abused by threat actors to conduct post-exploitation activities.  "LOLBAS is an attack method that uses binaries and scripts that are already part of the system for malicious purposes," Pentera security researcher Nir Chako  said . "This makes it hard for security teams to distinguish between legitimate and malicious activities, since they are all performed by trusted system utilities." To that end, the Israeli cybersecurity company said it uncovered nine LOLBAS downloaders and three executors that could enable adversaries to download and execute "more robust malware" on infected hosts. This includes: MsoHtmEd.exe, Mspub.exe, ProtocolHandler.exe, ConfigSecurityPolicy.exe, InstallUtil.exe, Mshta.exe, Presentationhost.exe, Outlook.exe, MSAccess.exe, scp.exe, and sftp.exe.  "In a complete attack chain, a hacker will us

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware campaign has been observed making use of malicious OpenBullet configuration files to target inexperienced cyber criminals with the goal of delivering a remote access trojan (RAT) capable of stealing sensitive information. Bot mitigation company Kasada  said  the activity is designed to "exploit trusted criminal networks," describing it as an instance of advanced threat actors "preying on beginner hackers." OpenBullet  is a legitimate  open-source pen testing tool  used for automating credential stuffing attacks. It takes in a  configuration file  that's tailored to a specific website and can combine it with a password list procured through other means to log successful attempts. "OpenBullet can be used with Puppeteer, which is a headless browser that can be used for automating web interactions," the company  said .

The attacks were flagged in mid-May 2022. A rocket design bureau based in Reutov, NPO Mashinostroyeniya was  sanctioned  by the U.S. Treasury Department in July 2014 in  connection  to "Russia's continued attempts to destabilize eastern Ukraine and its ongoing occupation of Crimea."

In today's interconnected world, evolving security solutions to meet growing demand is more critical than ever. Collaboration across multiple solutions for intelligence gathering and information sharing is indispensable. The idea of multiple-source intelligence gathering stems from the concept that threats are rarely isolated. Hence, their detection and prevention require a comprehensive understanding of the broader landscape. A comprehensive and robust security framework should be established by aggregating resources, knowledge, and expertise from various sources. This collaborative effort allows for the analysis of diverse data sets, the identification of emerging patterns, and the timely dissemination of crucial information.  In this article, we discuss a versatile security platform that can operate in two distinct roles within a security ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics has devised a "deep learning-based acoustic side-channel attack" that can be used to classify laptop keystrokes that are recorded using a nearby phone with 95% accuracy. "When trained on keystrokes recorded using the video conferencing software Zoom, an accuracy of 93% was achieved, a new best for the medium," researchers Joshua Harrison, Ehsan Toreini, and Maryam Mehrnezhad  said  in a new study published last week. Side-channel attacks  refer  to a class of  security exploits  that aim to glean insights from a system by monitoring and measuring its physical effects during the processing of sensitive data. Some of the common observable effects include runtime behavior, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, acoustics, and cache accesses. Although a completely side-channel-free implementation does not exist, practical attacks of this kind can have damaging consequences for user privacy and security as they could be weaponized by a ma

New SkidMap Linux Malware Variant Targeting Vulnerable Redis Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-skidmap-redis-malware-variant.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Vulnerable  Redis services  have been targeted by a "new, improved, dangerous" variant of a malware called SkidMap that's engineered to target a wide range of Linux distributions. "The malicious nature of this malware is to adapt to the system on which it is executed," Trustwave security researcher Radoslaw Zdonczyk  said  in an analysis published last week. Some of the Linux distribution SkidMap sets its eyes on include Alibaba, Anolis, openEuler, EulerOS, Stream, CentOS, RedHat, and Rocky. SkidMap was  first disclosed  by Trend Micro in September 2019 as a cryptocurrency mining botnet with capabilities to load malicious kernel modules that can obfuscate its activities as well as monitor the miner process. The operators of the malware have also been found camouflaging their backup command-and-control (C2) IP address on the Bitcoin blockchain, evocative of another botnet malware known as  Glupteba .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning about cyber crooks masquerading as legitimate non-fungible token (NFT) developers to steal cryptocurrency and other digital assets from unsuspecting users. In these fraudulent schemes, criminals either obtain direct access to NFT developer social media accounts or create look-alike accounts to promote "exclusive" new NFT releases, often employing misleading advertising campaigns that create a sense of urgency to pull them off. "Links provided in these announcements are phishing links directing victims to a spoofed website that appears to be a legitimate extension of a particular NFT project," the FBI  said  in an advisory last week. The replica websites urge potential targets to connect their cryptocurrency wallets and purchase the NFT, only for the threat actors to siphon the funds and NFTs to wallets under their control.

Reptile Rootkit: Advanced Linux Malware Targeting South Korean Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/reptile-rootkit-advanced-linux-malware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are using an open-source rootkit called  Reptile  to target Linux systems in South Korea. "Unlike other rootkit malware that typically only provide concealment capabilities, Reptile goes a step further by offering a reverse shell, allowing threat actors to easily take control of systems," the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)  said  in a report published this week. "Port knocking is a method where the malware opens a specific port on an infected system and goes on standby. When the threat actor sends a magic packet to the system, the received packet is used as a basis to establish a connection with the C&C server." A rootkit is a malicious software program that's designed to provide privileged, root-level access to a machine while concealing its presence. At least four different campaigns have leveraged Reptile since 2022. The first use of the rootkit was  recorded  by Trend Micro in May 2022 in connection with an intrusion

Microsoft on Friday disclosed that it has addressed a critical security flaw impacting Power Platform , but not before it came under criticism for its failure to swiftly act on it. "The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to Custom Code functions used for Power Platform custom connectors," the tech giant  said . "The potential impact could be unintended information disclosure if secrets or other sensitive information were embedded in the Custom Code function." The company further noted that no customer action is required and that it found no evidence of active exploitation of the vulnerability in the wild. Tenable, which initially discovered and reported the shortcoming to Redmond on March 30, 2023,  said  the problem could enable limited, unauthorized access to cross-tenant applications and sensitive data. The cybersecurity firm said the flaw arises as a result of insufficient access control to Azure Function hosts, leading to a scenario where a t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new high-severity security flaw in PaperCut print management software for Windows that could result in remote code execution under specific circumstances. Tracked as  CVE-2023-39143  (CVSS score: 8.4), the flaw impacts PaperCut NG/MF prior to version 22.1.3. It has been described as a combination of a path traversal and file upload vulnerability. "CVE-2023-39143 enables unauthenticated attackers to potentially read, delete, and upload arbitrary files to the PaperCut MF/NG application server, resulting in remote code execution in certain configurations," Horizon3.ai's Naveen Sunkavally  said . The cybersecurity firm said that file upload leading to remote code execution is possible when the external device integration setting is enabled, which is on by default in some installations of PaperCut. Earlier this April, another remote code execution vulnerability in the same product (CVE-2023-27350, CVSS score: 9.8) and an infor

NYC Couple Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering in $3.6 Billion Bitfinex Hack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/nyc-couple-pleads-guilty-to-money.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A married couple from New York City has pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in connection with the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency stock exchange Bitfinex, resulting in the theft of about 120,000 bitcoin. The development comes more than a year after Ilya Lichtenstein, 35, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 33, were  arrested in February 2022 , following the seizure of roughly 95,000 of the stolen crypto assets that were held by the defendants. The funds were valued at $3.6 billion at the time. Since then, the U.S. government said it has since seized another approximately $475 million tied to the breach. "Lichtenstein used a number of advanced hacking tools and techniques to gain access to Bitfinex's network," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)  said . "Once inside their systems, Lichtenstein fraudulently authorized more than 2,000 transactions in which 119,754 bitcoin was transferred from Bitfinex to a cryptocurrency wallet in Lichtenstein's control."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new bunch of malicious packages on the npm package registry that are designed to exfiltrate sensitive developer information. Software supply chain firm Phylum, which first identified the "test" packages on July 31, 2023, said they "demonstrated increasing functionality and refinement," hours after which they were removed and re-uploaded under different, legitimate-sounding package names. While the end goal of the undertaking is not clear, it's suspected to be a highly targeted campaign  aimed at the cryptocurrency sector  based on references to modules such as "rocketrefer" and "binarium." All the packages were published by the npm user malikrukd4732. A common feature across all the modules is the ability to launch JavaScript ("index.js") that's equipped to exfiltrate valuable information to a remote server. "The index.js code is spawned in a child process by the preinstall.j

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A four-year-old critical security flaw impacting Fortinet FortiOS SSL has emerged as one of the most routinely and frequently exploited vulnerabilities in 2022. "In 2022, malicious cyber actors exploited older software vulnerabilities more frequently than recently disclosed vulnerabilities and targeted unpatched, internet-facing systems," cybersecurity and intelligence agencies from the Five Eyes nations, which comprises Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S.,  said  in a joint alert. The continued weaponization of  CVE-2018-13379 , which was also one among the most exploited bugs in  2020  and  2021 , suggests a failure on the part of organizations to apply patches in a timely manner, the authorities said. "Malicious cyber actors likely prioritize developing exploits for severe and globally prevalent CVEs," according to the advisory.

Threat actors are leveraging a technique called versioning to evade Google Play Store's malware detections and target Android users. "Campaigns using versioning commonly target users' credentials, data, and finances," Google Cybersecurity Action Team (GCAT)  s aid  in its August 2023 Threat Horizons Report shared with The Hacker News. While versioning is not a new phenomenon, it's sneaky and hard to detect. In this method, a developer releases an initial version of an app on the Play Store that passes Google's pre-publication checks, but is later updated with a malware component. This is achieved by pushing an update from an attacker-controlled server to serve malicious code on the end user device using a method called dynamic code loading (DCL), effectively turning the app into a backdoor. Earlier this May, ESET  discovered  a screen recording app named "iRecorder - Screen Recorder" that remained innocuous for nearly a year after it was first

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new version of malware called  Rilide  that targets Chromium-based web browsers to steal sensitive data and steal cryptocurrency. "It exhibits a higher level of sophistication through modular design, code obfuscation, adoption to the  Chrome Extension Manifest V3 , and additional features such as the ability to exfiltrate stolen data to a Telegram channel or interval-based screenshot captures," Trustwave security researcher Pawel Knapczyk  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. Rilide was  first documented  by the cybersecurity company in April 2023, uncovering two different attack chains that made use of Ekipa RAT and Aurora Stealer to deploy rogue browser extensions capable of data and crypto theft. It's sold on dark web forums by an actor named "friezer" for $5,000. The malware is equipped with a wide range of features that allow it to disable other browser add-ons, harvest browsing history and cookies,

Hundreds of Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway servers have been breached by malicious actors to deploy web shells, according to the Shadowserver Foundation. The non-profit  said  the attacks take advantage of  CVE-2023-3519 , a critical code injection vulnerability that could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. The flaw, patched by Citrix last month, carries a CVSS score of 9.8. The  largest number  of impacted IP addresses are based in Germany, followed by France, Switzerland, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Japan, China, Austria, and Brazil. The  exploitation  of CVE-2023-3519 to deploy web shells was previously disclosed by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which  said  the attack was directed against an unnamed critical infrastructure organization in June 2023. The disclosure comes as GreyNoise  said  it detected three IP addresses  attempting  to exploit CVE-2023-24489 (CVSS score: 9.1), another critical flaw in Citrix ShareFile software that

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The frequency and complexity of cyber threats are constantly evolving. At the same time, organizations are now collecting sensitive data that, if compromised, could result in severe financial and reputational damage.  According to Cybersecurity Ventures , the cost of cybercrime is predicted to hit $8 trillion in 2023 and will grow to $10.5 trillion by 2025. There is also increasing public and regulatory scrutiny over data protection. Compliance regulations (such as PCI DSS and ISO 27001), as well as the need for a better understanding of your cybersecurity risks, are driving the need to conduct regular penetration tests.  Pen testing helps to identify security flaws in your IT infrastructure before threat actors can detect and exploit them. This gives you visibility into the risks posed by potential attacks and enables you to take swift corrective action to address them. Here, we outline key factors to consider before, during, and post the penetration testing process. Pre-Penetrati

Microsoft is warning of the threat malicious cyber actors pose to stadium operations, warning that the cyber risk surface of live sporting events is "rapidly expanding." "Information on athletic performance, competitive advantage, and personal information is a lucrative target," the company said in a Cyber Signals report shared with The Hacker News. "Sports teams, major league and global sporting associations, and entertainment venues house a trove of valuable information desirable to cybercriminals." "Unfortunately, this information can be vulnerable at-scale, due to the number of connected devices and interconnected networks in these environments." The company specifically singled out hospitals delivering critical support and health services for fans and players as being targets of ransomware attacks, resulting in service disruptions. To defend against such attacks, Microsoft is recommending that - Companies disable unnecessary ports a

A hacktivist group known as  Mysterious Team Bangladesh  has been linked to over 750 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and 78 website defacements since June 2022. "The group most frequently attacks logistics, government, and financial sector organizations in India and Israel," Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity firm Group-IB said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The group is primarily driven by religious and political motives." Some of the other targeted countries include Australia, Senegal, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Ethiopia. In addition, the threat actor is said to have gained access to web servers and administrative panels, likely by exploiting known security flaws or poorly-secured passwords. Mysterious Team Bangladesh, as the name indicates, is suspected to be of Bangladeshi origin. "We are working to protect Our Bangladesh Cyberspace," the group's Intro on Facebook  reads .

Microsoft on Wednesday disclosed that it identified a set of highly targeted social engineering attacks mounted by a Russian nation-state threat actor using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats. The tech giant attributed the attacks to a group it tracks as  Midnight Blizzard  (previously Nobelium). It's also called APT29, BlueBravo, Cozy Bear, Iron Hemlock, and The Dukes. "In this latest activity, the threat actor uses previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities," the company  said . "Using these domains from compromised tenants, Midnight Blizzard leverages Teams messages to send lures that attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and eliciting approval of multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts." Microsoft said the campaign, observed since at least late May 2023, affected less than 40 organizations global

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a bypass for a recently fixed actively exploited vulnerability in some versions of Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), prompting Ivanti to urge users to update to the latest version of the software. Tracked as  CVE-2023-35082  (CVSS score: 10.0) and discovered by Rapid7, the issue "allows unauthenticated attackers to access the API in older unsupported versions of MobileIron Core (11.2 and below)." "If exploited, this vulnerability enables an unauthorized, remote (internet-facing) actor to potentially access users' personally identifiable information and make limited changes to the server," Ivanti  said  in an advisory released on August 2, 2023. Rapid7 security researcher Stephen Fewer  said , "CVE-2023-35082 arises from the same place as CVE-2023-35078, specifically the permissive nature of certain entries in the mifs web application's security filter chain."

A Russia-nexus adversary has been linked to 94 new domains starting March 2023, suggesting that the group is actively modifying its infrastructure in response to public disclosures about its activities. Cybersecurity firm Recorded Future linked the revamped infrastructure to a threat actor it tracks under the name  BlueCharlie , a hacking crew that's broadly known by the names Blue Callisto, Callisto (or Calisto), COLDRIVER, Star Blizzard (formerly SEABORGIUM), and TA446. BlueCharlie was previously given the temporary designation Threat Activity Group 53 (TAG-53). "These shifts demonstrate that these threat actors are aware of industry reporting and show a certain level of sophistication in their efforts to obfuscate or modify their activity, aiming to stymie security researchers," the company said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. BlueCharlie is assessed to be affiliated with Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), with the threat actor linked

A sophisticated Facebook phishing campaign has been observed exploiting a zero-day flaw in Salesforce's email services, allowing threat actors to craft targeted phishing messages using the company's domain and infrastructure. "Those phishing campaigns cleverly evade conventional detection methods by chaining the Salesforce vulnerability and legacy quirks in Facebook's Web Games platform," Guardio Labs researchers Oleg Zaytsev and Nati Tal  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. The email messages masquerade as coming from Meta, while being sent from an email address with a "@salesforce.com" domain. They seek to trick recipients into clicking on a link by claiming that their Facebook accounts are undergoing a "comprehensive investigation" due to "suspicions of engaging in impersonation." The goal is to direct users to a rogue landing page that's designed to capture the victim's account credentials and two-factor aut

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new post-exploitation technique in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows the AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) to be run as a remote access trojan on Windows and Linux environments "The SSM agent, a legitimate tool used by admins to manage their instances, can be re-purposed by an attacker who has achieved high privilege access on an endpoint with SSM agent installed, to carry out malicious activities on an ongoing basis," Mitiga researchers Ariel Szarf and Or Aspir  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This allows an attacker who has compromised a machine, hosted on AWS or anywhere else, to maintain access to it and perform various malicious activities." SSM Agent is a  software  installed on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that makes it possible for administrators to update, manage, and configure their AWS resources through a unified interface.

Services offered by an obscure Iranian company known as Cloudzy are being leveraged by multiple threat actors, including cybercrime groups and nation-state crews. "Although Cloudzy is incorporated in the United States, it almost certainly operates out of Tehran, Iran – in possible violation of U.S. sanctions – under the direction of someone going by the name  Hassan Nozari ," Halcyon  said  in a new report published Tuesday. The Texas-based cybersecurity firm said the company acts as a command-and-control provider (C2P), which provides attackers with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) virtual private servers and other anonymized services that ransomware affiliates and others use to pull off the cybercriminal endeavors. "[C2Ps] enjoy a liability loophole that does not require them to ensure that the infrastructure they provide is not being used for illegal operations," Halcyon said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.

Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploited a recently disclosed critical flaw impacting Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) as a zero-day since at least April 2023 in attacks directed against Norwegian entities, including a government network. The disclosure comes as part of a new joint advisory released by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Norwegian National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NO) Tuesday. The exact identity or origin of the threat actor remains unclear. "The APT actors have exploited CVE-2023-35078 since at least April 2023," the authorities  said . "The actors leveraged compromised small office/home office (SOHO) routers, including ASUS routers, to proxy to target infrastructure.' CVE-2023-35078 refers to a  severe flaw  that allows threat actors to access personally identifiable information (PII) and gain the ability to make configuration changes on compromised systems.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a Python variant of a stealer malware  NodeStealer  that's equipped to fully take over Facebook business accounts as well as siphon cryptocurrency. Palo Alto Network Unit 42 said it detected the previously undocumented strain as part of a campaign that commenced in December 2022. NodeStealer was  first exposed  by Meta in May 2023, describing it as a stealer capable of harvesting cookies and passwords from web browsers to compromise Facebook, Gmail, and Outlook accounts. While the prior samples were written in JavaScript, the latest versions are coded in Python. "NodeStealer poses great risk for both individuals and organizations," Unit 42 researcher Lior Rochberger  said . "Besides the direct impact on Facebook business accounts, which is mainly financial, the malware also steals credentials from browsers, which can be used for further attacks." The attacks start with bogus messages on Facebook that purportedly clai

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Various European customers of different banks are being targeted by an Android banking trojan called  SpyNote  as part of an aggressive campaign detected in June and July 2023. "The spyware is distributed through email phishing or smishing campaigns and the fraudulent activities are executed with a combination of remote access trojan (RAT) capabilities and vishing attack," Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy  said  in a technical analysis released Monday. SpyNote , also called SpyMax, is similar to other Android banking Trojans in that it requires  Android's accessibility permissions  in order to grant itself other necessary permissions and gather sensitive data from infected devices. What makes the malware strain notable is its dual functions as spyware and perform bank fraud. The attack chains commence with a bogus SMS message urging users to install a banking app by clicking on the accompanying link, redirecting the victim to the legitimate TeamViewer QuickSupport a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Data Security Posture Management is an approach to securing cloud data by ensuring that sensitive data always has the correct security posture - regardless of where it's been duplicated or moved to. So, what is DSPM? Here's a quick example: Let's say you've built an excellent  security posture  for your cloud data. For the sake of this example, your data is in production, it's protected behind a firewall, it's not publicly accessible, and your IAM controls have limited access properly. Now along comes a developer and replicates that data into a lower environment. What happens to that fine security posture you've built?  Well, it's gone - and now the data is only protected by the security posture in that lower environment. So if that environment is exposed or improperly secured - so is all that sensitive data you've been trying to protect. Security postures just don't travel with their data . Data Security Posture Management ( DSPM ) was crea

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor known as  Space Pirates  has been linked to attacks against at least 16 organizations in Russia and Serbia over the past year by employing novel tactics and adding new cyber weapons to its arsenal. "The cybercriminals' main goals are still espionage and theft of confidential information, but the group has expanded its interests and the geography of its attacks," Positive Technologies  said  in a deep dive report published last week. Targets comprise government agencies, educational institutions, private security companies, aerospace manufacturers, agricultural producers, defense, energy, and healthcare firms in Russia and Serbia. Space Pirates was  first exposed  by the Russian cybersecurity company in May 2022, highlighting its attacks on the aerospace sector in the nation. The group, said to be active since at least late 2019, has links to another adversary tracked by Symantec as  Webworm . Positive Technologies' analysis of the attack infrast

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A nation-state actor with links to China is suspected of being behind a series of attacks against industrial organizations in Eastern Europe that took place last year to siphon data stored on air-gapped systems. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky attributed the intrusions with medium to high confidence to a hacking crew called  APT31 , which is also tracked under the monikers Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, and Violet Typhoon (formerly Zirconium), citing commonalities in the tactics observed. The attacks entailed the use of more than 15 distinct implants and their variants, broken down into three broad categories based on their ability to establish persistent remote access, gather sensitive information, and transmit the collected data to actor-controlled infrastructure. "One of the implant types appeared to be a sophisticated modular malware, aimed at profiling removable drives and contaminating them with a worm to exfiltrate data from isolated, or air-gapped, networks of indus

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Organizations in Italy are the target of a new phishing campaign that leverages a new strain of malware called  WikiLoader  with an ultimate aim to install a banking trojan, stealer, and spyware referred to as  Ursnif  (aka Gozi). "It is a sophisticated downloader with the objective of installing a second malware payload," Proofpoint  said  in a technical report. "The malware uses multiple mechanisms to evade detection and was likely developed as a malware that can be rented out to select cybercriminal threat actors." WikiLoader is so named due to the malware making a request to Wikipedia and checking that the response has the string "The Free." The enterprise security firm said it first detected the malware in the wild on December 27, 2022, in connection with an intrusion set mounted by a threat actor it tracks as  TA544 , which is also known as Bamboo Spider and Zeus Panda.
