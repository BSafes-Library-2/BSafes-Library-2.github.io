Hackers Hide Malware in Stunning Images Taken by James Webb Space Telescope<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/hackers-hide-malware-in-stunning-images.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A persistent Golang-based malware campaign dubbed GO#WEBBFUSCATOR has leveraged the deep field image taken from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as a lure to deploy malicious payloads on infected systems.  The development, revealed by Securonix , points to the growing adoption of Go among threat actors, given the programming language's cross-platform support, effectively allowing the operators to leverage a common codebase to target different operating systems.  Go binaries also have the added benefit of rendering reverse engineering a lot more challenging as opposed to malware written in other languages like C++ or C#, not to mention prolong analysis and detection attempts.  Phishing emails containing a Microsoft Office attachment act as the entry point for the attack chain that, when opened, retrieves an obfuscated VBA macro, which, in turn, is auto-executed should the recipient enable macros.   The execution of the macro results in the download of an image file &quo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat landscape has changed dramatically over the past decade. While cybercriminals continue to look for new ways to gain access to networks and steal sensitive information, the mobile attack surface is also expanding.  Mobile devices are not only becoming more powerful but also more vulnerable to cyberattacks, making mobile security an increasingly important concern for enterprises.  This means that anyone accessing the Internet via their cell phone or logging into their home or work network at any time is putting both their own personal data and that of their company at risk.  No matter how big or small your business is, you should always take steps to ensure the security of your employees and customers. Recent global attacks have shown us just how vulnerable businesses are to cyberattacks.  There are several ways hackers can attack mobile devices. To protect their data, businesses should take a comprehensive approach that addresses both internal and external threats.  Jamf Thr

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A months-long cyber espionage campaign undertaken by a Chinese nation-state group targeted several entities with reconnaissance malware so as to glean information about its victims and meet its strategic goals.  "The targets of this recent campaign spanned Australia, Malaysia, and Europe, as well as entities that operate in the South China Sea," enterprise security firm Proofpoint  said  in a published in partnership with PwC.  Targets encompass local and federal Australian Governmental agencies, Australian news media companies, and global heavy industry manufacturers which conduct maintenance of fleets of wind turbines in the South China Sea.  Proofpoint and PwC attributed the intrusions with moderate confidence to a threat actor tracked by the two companies under the names TA423 and Red Ladon respectively, which is also known as APT40 and Leviathan.  APT40 is the name designated to a China-based, espionage-motivated threat actor that's known to be active since 2013 and

As many as three disparate but related campaigns between March and Jun 2022 have been found to deliver a variety of malware, including ModernLoader, RedLine Stealer, and cryptocurrency miners onto compromised systems.  "The actors use PowerShell, .NET assemblies, and HTA and VBS files to spread across a targeted network, eventually dropping other pieces of malware, such as the  SystemBC  trojan and  DCRat , to enable various stages of their operations," Cisco Talos researcher Vanja Svajcer said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.   The malicious implant in question, ModernLoader , is designed to provide attackers with remote control over the victim's machine, which enables the adversaries to deploy additional malware, steal sensitive information, or even ensnare the computer in a botnet.  Cisco Talos attributed the infections to a previously undocumented but Russian-speaking threat actor, citing the use of off-the-shelf tools. Potential targets included Eastern Eur

As threat complexity increases and the boundaries of an organization have all but disappeared, security teams are more challenged than ever to deliver consistent security outcomes. One company aiming to help security teams meet this challenge is  Stellar Cyber .   Stellar Cyber claims to address the needs of MSSPs by providing capabilities typically found in NG-SIEM, NDR, and SOAR products in their Open XDR platform, managed with a single license. According to Stellar Cyber, this consolidation means faster security analyst ramp time and customer onboarding with far less manually intensive tasks required. Stellar Cyber currently counts 20+ of the top MSSP providers as customers, providing security for over 3 million assets. In addition, stellar Cyber claims after deployment, users see up to 20x faster mean time to respond (MTTR), a bold claim.  We recently took a closer look at the Stellar Cyber Security Operations Platform.   Before we begin  Before digging into the platform, here are

The bug was identified on August 7, 2022, the same day the low-cost airline commenced its operations in the country.   "I found an HTTP request which gave my name, email, phone number, gender, etc. in JSON format," Barot  said  in a write-up. "I immediately changed some parameters in [the] request and I was able to see other user's PII. It took around ~30 minutes to find this issue."

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Monday warned of cyber criminals increasingly exploiting flaws in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to plunder cryptocurrency.  "The FBI has observed cyber criminals exploiting vulnerabilities in the smart contracts governing DeFi platforms to steal investors' cryptocurrency," the agency  said  in a notification.  Attackers are said to have used different methods to hack and steal cryptocurrency from DeFi platforms, including initiating flash loans that trigger exploits in the platforms' smart contracts and exploiting signature verification flaws in their token bridge to withdraw all investments.   The agency has also observed criminals defrauding the platforms by manipulating cryptocurrency price pairs – assets that can be traded for each other on an exchange – by exploiting a series of vulnerabilities to bypass  slippage checks  and steal roughly $35 million in digital funds.

"Kochava then sells customized data feeds to its clients to, among other purposes, assist in advertising and analyzing foot traffic at stores or other locations," the FTC  said . "Among other categories, Kochava sells timestamped latitude and longitude coordinates showing the location of mobile devices."  The company advertises itself as a "real-time data solutions company" and the "largest independent data marketplace for connected devices."

A new ransomware strain written in Golang dubbed " Agenda " has been spotted in the wild, targeting healthcare and education entities in Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Thailand.  "Agenda can reboot systems in safe mode, attempts to stop many server-specific processes and services, and has multiple modes to run," Trend Micro researchers  said  in an analysis last week.  Qilin, the threat actor advertising the ransomware on the dark web, is said to provide affiliates with options to tailor the binary payloads for each victim, enabling the operators to decide the ransom note, encryption extension, as well as the list of processes and services to terminate before commencing the encryption process.   Additionally, the ransomware incorporates techniques for detection evasion by taking advantage of the 'safe mode' feature of a device to proceed with its file encryption routine unnoticed, but not before changing the default user's password and enabl

Nitrokod Crypto Miner Infected Over 111,000 Users with Copies of Popular Software<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/nitrokod-crypto-miner-infected-over.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Turkish-speaking entity called Nitrokod  has been attributed to an active cryptocurrency mining campaign that involves impersonating a desktop application for Google Translate to infect over 111,000 victims in 11 countries since 2019.   "The malicious tools can be used by anyone," Maya Horowitz, vice president of research at Check Point, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. "They can be found by a simple web search, downloaded from a link, and installation is a simple double-click."  The list of countries with victims includes the U.K., the U.S., Sri Lanka, Greece, Israel, Germany, Turkey, Cyprus, Australia, Mongolia, and Poland.   The  campaign  entails serving malware through free software hosted on popular sites such as Softpedia and Uptodown. But in an interesting tactic, the malware puts off its execution for weeks and separates its malicious activity from the downloaded fake software to avoid detection.   The installation of the infected program

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Twilio, which earlier this month became a  sophisticated phishing attack , disclosed last week that the threat actors also managed to gain access to the accounts of 93 individual users of its Authy two-factor authentication (2FA) service.  The communication tools company  said  the unauthorized access made it possible for the adversary to register additional devices to those accounts. It has since identified and removed the illegitimately added devices from the impacted accounts.  Authy, acquired by Twilio in February 2015, allows  safeguarding online accounts  with a second security layer to prevent account takeover attacks. It's estimated to have nearly 75 million users.  Twilio further noted its investigation as of August 24, 2022, turned up 163 affected customers, up from 125 it reported on August 10, whose accounts it said were hacked for a limited period of time.   Besides Twilio, the sprawling campaign, dubbed  0ktapus  by Group-IB, is believed to have struck 136 companies,

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday added 10 new actively exploited vulnerabilities to its  Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , including a high-severity security flaw affecting industrial automation software from Delta Electronics.  The issue, tracked as  CVE-2021-38406  (CVSS score: 7.8), impacts DOPSoft 2 versions 2.00.07 and prior. A successful exploitation of the flaw may lead to arbitrary code execution.  "Delta Electronics DOPSoft 2 lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing specific project files (improper input validation) resulting in an out-of-bounds write that allows for code execution," CISA said in an alert.  It's worth noting that CVE-2021-38406 was originally disclosed as part of an industrial control systems (ICS) advisory  published  in September 2021.   However, there are no patches that address the vulnerability, with CISA noting that the "impacted product is end-of-life and shoul

Iranian Hackers Exploiting Unpatched Log4j 2 Bugs to Target Israeli Organizations<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/iranian-hackers-exploiting-unpatched.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Iranian state-sponsored actors are leaving no stone unturned to exploit unpatched systems running Log4j to target Israeli entities, indicating the vulnerability's  long tail  for remediation.  Microsoft attributed the latest set of activities to the  umbrella threat group  tracked as  MuddyWater  (aka Cobalt Ulster, Mercury, Seedworm, or Static Kitten), which is  linked  to the Iranian intelligence apparatus, the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).   The attacks are notable for using SysAid Server instances unsecured against the  Log4Shell flaw  as a vector for initial access,  marking  a  departure  from the actors' pattern of leveraging VMware applications for breaching target environments.  "After gaining access, Mercury establishes persistence, dumps credentials, and moves laterally within the targeted organization using both custom and well-known hacking tools, as well as built-in operating system tools for its hands-on-keyboard attack," Microsoft  said .

Atlassian has rolled out fixes for a  critical security flaw  in Bitbucket Server and Data Center that could lead to the execution of malicious code on vulnerable installations.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-36804  (CVSS score: 9.9), the issue has been characterized as a command injection vulnerability in multiple endpoints that could be exploited via specially crafted HTTP requests.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Nation-state threat actors are  increasingly adopting  and integrating the Sliver  command-and-control (C2) framework in their intrusion campaigns as a replacement for Cobalt Strike.  "Given Cobalt Strike's popularity as an attack tool, defenses against it have also improved over time," Microsoft security experts  said . "Sliver thus presents an attractive alternative for actors looking for a lesser-known toolset with a low barrier for entry."  Sliver, first made public in late 2019 by cybersecurity company BishopFox, is a Go-based  open source C2 platform  that supports user-developed extensions, custom implant generation, and other commandeering options.   "A C2 framework usually includes a server that accepts connections from implants on a compromised system, and a client application that allows the C2 operators to interact with the implants and launch malicious commands," Microsoft said.  Besides facilitating long-term access to infected hosts, the cross-platform kit is also known

The threat actor behind the attacks on  Twilio  and  Cloudflare  earlier this month has been linked to a broader phishing campaign aimed at 136 organizations that resulted in a cumulative compromise of 9,931 accounts.  The activity has been condemned  0ktapus  by Group-IB because the initial goal of the attacks was to "obtain Okta identity credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes from users of the targeted organizations."  Calling the attacks well designed and executed, the Singapore-headquartered company said the adversary singled out employees of companies that are customers of identity services provider Okta.   The modus operandi involved sending targets text messages containing links to phishing sites that impersonated the Okta authentication page of the respective targeted entities.  "This case is of interest because despite using low-skill methods it was able to compromise a large number of well-known organizations," Group-IB  said . "Furthe

The threat actor behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack has been linked to yet another "highly targeted" post-exploitation malware that could be used to maintain persistent access to compromised environments.

Nobelium is the tech giant's moniker for a cluster of activities that came to light with the  sophisticated attack targeting SolarWinds  in December 2020, and which overlaps with the Russian nation-state hacking group widely known as  APT29 , Cozy Bear, or The Dukes.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In recent months, the House of Representatives has been hard at work drafting various spending bills for the 2023 fiscal year. While these bills provide funding for a vast array of government programs and agencies, there was one thing that really stands out. Collectively, the bills that are making their way through the house  allocate a staggering $15.6 billion to cybersecurity spending .  As you could probably guess, the lion's share of this spending ($11.2 billion) is being allocated to the Department of Defense. It is worth noting, however, that nearly $3 billion is going to the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).  Although it may be tempting to think of these cybersecurity budget allocations as just another example of excessive government spending, it's worth considering what a $15.6 billion cash infusion will mean for the IT security industry. It's equally important to consider why the US government finds it necessary to ramp up its cybersecurity

The North Korean nation-state group Kimusky has been linked to a new set of malicious activities directed against political and diplomatic entities located in its southern counterpart in early 2022.

Included among the potential victims are South Korean university professors, think tank researchers, and government officials.    Kimsuky , also known as Black Banshee, Thallium, and Velvet Chollima, is the name given to a prolific North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) group that targets entities globally, but with a primary focus on South Korea, to gain intelligence on various topics of interest to the regime.

The Python Package Index, PyPI, on Wednesday sounded the alarm about an ongoing phishing campaign that aims to steal developer credentials and inject malicious updates to legitimate packages.  "This is the first known phishing attack against PyPI," the maintainers of the official third-party software repository  said  in a series of tweets.  The social engineering attack entails sending security-themed messages that create a false sense of urgency by informing recipients that Google is implementing a mandatory validation process on all packages and that they need to click on a link to complete the validation before September, or risk getting their PyPI modules removed.   Should an unsuspecting developer fall for the scheme, users are directed to a lookalike landing page that mimics PyPI's login page and is hosted on Google Sites, from where the entered credentials are captured and abused to unauthorizedly access the accounts and compromise the packages to include malware

Threat actors have begun to use the Tox peer-to-peer instant messaging service as a command-and-control method, marking a shift from its earlier role as a contact method for ransomware negotiations.  The findings from Uptycs, which analyzed an Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) artifact (" 72client ") that functions as a bot and can run scripts on the compromised host using the Tox protocol.  Tox is a  serverless protocol  for online communications that offers end-to-end encryption (E2EE) protections by making use of the Networking and Cryptography library ( NaCl , pronounced "salt") for encryption and authentication.   "The binary found in the wild is a stripped but dynamic executable, making decompilation easier," researchers Siddharth Sharma and Nischay Hedge  said . "The entire binary appears to be written in C, and has only  statically linked  the c-toxcore library."  It's worth noting that c-toxcore is a  reference implementation  of

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security researcher who has a long line of work demonstrating novel data exfiltration methods from air-gapped systems has come up with yet another technique that involves sending Morse code signals via LEDs on network interface cards ( NICs ).  The approach, codenamed  ETHERLED , comes from Dr. Mordechai Guri , the head of R&D in the Cyber Security Research Center in the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, who recently outlined  GAIROSCOPE , a method for transmitting data ultrasonically to smartphone gyroscopes.   "Malware installed on the device could programmatically control the status LED by blinking or alternating its colors, using documented methods or undocumented firmware commands," Dr. Guri said.  "Information can be encoded via simple encoding such as Morse code and modulated over these optical signals. An attacker can intercept and decode these signals from tens to hundreds of meters away."   A network interface card, also known as a netwo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
From ransomware to breaches, from noncompliance penalties to reputational damage – cyberthreats pose an existential risk to any business. But for SMEs and SMBs, the danger is compounded. These companies realize they  need  an in-house Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) – someone who can assess risks and vulnerabilities, create and execute a comprehensive cybersecurity plan, ensure compliance and safeguard business continuity. Yet unlike large enterprises, most don't have the budget to bring a full-time experienced CISO on board.  To bridge this gap, managed service providers (MSPs), managed security service providers (MSSPs), and consulting firms offer virtual CISO (vCISO), or 'CISO-as-a-service' services. The model is simple: instead of hiring a full-time CISO, SMEs and SMBs pay a subscription or a retainer to gain access to expert cyber assistance in the form of a virtual CISO. Staffed by seasoned veteran executives, vCISOs offer C-level assistance in devising and

WordPress sites are being hacked to display fraudulent Cloudflare DDoS protection pages that lead to the delivery of malware such as NetSupport RAT and Raccoon Stealer.  "A recent surge in JavaScript injections targeting WordPress sites has resulted in fake DDoS prevent prompts which lead victims to download remote access trojan malware," Sucuri's Ben Martin  said  in a write-up published last week.  Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection pages are essential browser verification checks designed to deter bot-driven unwanted and malicious traffic from eating up bandwidth and taking down websites.  The new attack vector involves hijacking WordPress sites to display fake DDoS protection pop-ups that, when clicked, ultimately lead to the download of a malicious ISO file ("security_install.iso") to the victim's systems.   This is achieved by injecting three lines of code into a JavaScript file ("jquery.min.js"), or alternatively into the active

The low-volume Gmail AiTM phishing campaign also entails using the compromised emails of chief executives to conduct further social engineering, with the attacks also utilizing several compromised domains as an intermediate URL redirector to take the victims to the final landing page.

DevOps platform GitLab this week issued patches to address a critical security flaw in its software that could lead to arbitrary code execution on affected systems.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-2884 , the issue is rated 9.9 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system and impacts all versions of GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE) starting from 11.3.4 before 15.1.5, 15.2 before 15.2.3, and 15.3 before 15.3.1.  At its core, the security weakness is a case of authenticated remote code execution that can be triggered via the GitHub import API. GitLab credited  yvvdwf  with discovering and reporting the flaw.   While the issue has been resolved in versions 15.3.1, 15.2.3, 15.1.5, users also have the option of securing against the flaw by temporarily disabling the GitHub import option -   Click "Menu" -> "Admin"  Click "Settings" -> "General"  Expand the "Visibility and access controls" tab  Under "Import sources"

The Iranian government-backed actor known as Charming Kitten has added a new tool to its malware arsenal that allows it to retrieve user data from Gmail, Yahoo!, and Microsoft Outlook accounts.  Dubbed  HYPERSCRAPE  by Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG), the actively in-development malicious software is said to have been used against less than two dozen accounts in Iran, with the oldest known sample dating back to 2020. The tool was first discovered in December 2021.  Charming Kitten, a prolific advanced persistent threat (APT), is believed to be  associated  with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and has a history of conducting espionage aligned with the interests of the government.   Tracked as APT35, Cobalt Illusion, ITG18, Phosphorus, TA453, and Yellow Garuda, elements of the group have also carried out ransomware attacks, suggesting that the threat actor's motives are both espionage and financially driven.

The operators of the XCSSET macOS malware have upped the stakes by making iterative improvements that add support for macOS Monterey by upgrading its source code components to Python 3.  "The malware authors have changed from hiding the primary executable in a fake Xcode.app in the initial versions in 2020 to a fake Mail.app in 2021 and now to a fake Notes.app in 2022," SentinelOne researchers Phil Stokes and Dinesh Devadoss  said  in a report.  XCSSET, first  documented  by Trend Micro in 2020, has many moving parts that allow it to  harvest sensitive information  from Apple Notes, WeChat, Skype, and Telegram; inject malicious JavaScript code into various websites; and dump cookies from Safari web browser.   Infection chains entail using a dropper to compromise users' Xcode projects with the backdoor, with the latter also taking steps to evade detection by masquerading as either system software or the Google Chrome web browser application.

The Rise of Data Exfiltration and Why It Is a Greater Risk Than Ransomware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/the-rise-of-data-exfiltration-and-why.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ransomware is the de facto threat organizations have faced over the past few years. Threat actors were making easy money by exploiting the high valuation of cryptocurrencies and their victims' lack of adequate preparation.   Think about bad security policies, untested backups, patch management practices not up-to-par, and so forth. It resulted in easy growth for ransomware extortion, a crime that multiple threat actors around the world perpetrate.   Something's changed, though. Crypto valuations have dropped, reducing the monetary appeal of ransomware attacks due to organizations mounting a formidable defense against ransomware.  Threat actors have been searching for another opportunity – and found one. It's called data exfiltration, or exfil, a type of espionage causing headaches at organizations worldwide. Let's take a look.  The threat to reveal confidential information  Information exfiltration is rapidly becoming more prevalent. Earlier this year, incidents at Nvi

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected Iranian threat activity cluster has been linked to attacks aimed at Israeli shipping, government, energy, and healthcare organizations as part of an espionage-focused campaign that commenced in late 2020.  Cybersecurity firm Mandiant is tracking the group under its uncategorized moniker  UNC3890 , which is believed to conduct operations that align with Iranian interests.  "The collected data may be leveraged to support various activities, from hack-and-leak, to enabling kinetic warfare attacks like those that have plagued the shipping industry in recent years," the company's Israel Research Team  noted .   Intrusions mounted by the group lead to the deployment of two proprietary pieces of malware: a "small but efficient" backdoor named SUGARUSH and a browser credential stealer called SUGARDUMP that exfiltrates password information to an email address associated with Gmail, ProtonMail, Yahoo, and Yandex.

"As Nasty as Dirty Pipe" — 8 Year Old Linux Kernel Vulnerability Uncovered<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/as-nasty-as-dirty-pipe-8-year-old-linux.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details of an eight-year-old security vulnerability in the Linux kernel have emerged that the researchers say is "as nasty as Dirty Pipe."  Dubbed  DirtyCred  by a group of academics from Northwestern University, the security weakness exploits a previously unknown flaw ( CVE-2022-2588 ) to escalate privileges to the maximum level.  "DirtyCred is a kernel exploitation concept that swaps unprivileged  kernel credentials  with privileged ones to escalate privilege," researchers Zhenpeng Lin, Yuhang Wu, and Xinyu Xing noted. "Instead of overwriting any critical data fields on kernel heap, DirtyCred abuses the heap memory reuse mechanism to get privileged."   This entails three steps -   Free an in-use unprivileged credential with the vulnerability  Allocate privileged credentials in the freed memory slot by triggering a privileged userspace process such as su, mount, or sshd  Operate as a privileged user   The novel exploitation method, according to the resea

Atlanta-based cyber risk intelligence company, Cyble discovered a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) malware. What makes this particular RAT malware distinct enough to be named after the  comic creation of Sacha Baron Cohen ?  RAT malware typically helps cybercriminals gain complete control of a victim's system, permitting them to access network resources, files, and power to toggle the mouse and keyboard. Borat RAT malware goes beyond the standard features and enables threat actors to deploy ransomware and  DDoS attacks . It also increases the number of threat actors who can launch attacks, sometimes appealing to the lowest common denominator. The added functionality of carrying out DDoS attacks makes it insidious and a risk to today's digital organizations.  Ransomware has been the most common top attack type for over  three years . According to an IBM report, REvil was the most common ransomware strain, consisting of about  37%  of all ransomware attacks. Borat RAT is a unique

Researchers have disclosed multiple vulnerabilities impacting Ultra-wideband (UWB) Real-time Locating Systems ( RTLS ), enabling threat actors to launch adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks and tamper with location data.  "The zero-days found specifically pose a security risk for workers in industrial environments," cybersecurity firm Nozomi Networks  disclosed  in a technical write-up last week. "If a threat actor exploits these vulnerabilities, they have the ability to tamper with safety zones designated by RTLS to protect workers in hazardous areas."   RTLS is used to automatically identify and track the location of objects or people in real-time, usually within a confined indoor area. This is achieved by making use of tags that are attached to assets, which broadcast USB signals to fixed reference points called anchors that then determine their location.  But flaws identified in RTLS solutions –  Sewio Indoor Tracking RTLS UWB Wi-Fi Kit  and  Avalue Renity Ar

Bitcoin ATM manufacturer General Bytes confirmed that it was a victim of a cyberattack that exploited a previously unknown flaw in its software to plunder cryptocurrency from its users.  "The attacker was able to create an admin user remotely via CAS administrative interface via a URL call on the page that is used for the default installation on the server and creating the first administration user," the company  said  in an advisory last week. "This vulnerability has been present in CAS software since version 2020-12-08."   It's not immediately clear how many servers were breached using this flaw and how much cryptocurrency was stolen.  CAS is short for  Crypto Application Server , a self-hosted product from General Bytes that enables companies to manage Bitcoin ATM ( BATM ) machines from a central location via a web browser on a desktop or a mobile device.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Organizations in the Spanish-speaking nations of Mexico and Spain are in the crosshairs of a new campaign designed to deliver the  Grandoreiro  banking trojan.   "In this campaign, the threat actors impersonate government officials from the Attorney General's Office of Mexico City and from the Public Ministry in the form of spear-phishing emails in order to lure victims to download and execute 'Grandoreiro,' a prolific banking trojan that has been active since at least 2016, and that specifically targets users in Latin America," Zscaler  said  in a report.  The ongoing attacks, which commenced in June 2022, have been observed to target automotive, civil and industrial construction, logistics, and machinery sectors via multiple infection chains in Mexico and chemicals manufacturing industries in Spain.   Attack chains entail leveraging spear-phishing emails written in Spanish to trick potential victims into clicking on an embedded link that retrieves a ZIP archive

The Donot Team  threat actor has updated its Jaca  Windows malware toolkit with improved capabilities, including a revamped stealer module designed to plunder information from Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers.  The improvements also include a new infection chain that incorporates previously undocumented components to the modular framework, Morphisec researchers Hido Cohen and Arnold Osipov  disclosed  in a report published last week.  Also known as APT-C-35 and Viceroy Tiger, the Donot Team is known for setting its sights on defense, diplomatic, government, and military entities in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, among others at least since 2016.  Evidence unearthed by Amnesty International in October 2021  connected  the group's attack infrastructure to an Indian cybersecurity company called Innefu Labs.

A financially motivated cybercrime group has been linked to an ongoing wave of attacks aimed at hospitality, hotel, and travel organizations in Latin America with the goal of installing malware on compromised systems.  Enterprise security firm Proofpoint, which is tracking the group under the name TA558 dating all the way back to April 2018, called it a "small crime threat actor."  "Since 2018, this group has used consistent tactics, techniques, and procedures to attempt to install a variety of malware including Loda RAT, Vjw0rm, and Revenge RAT," the company's threat research team  said  in a new report.  The group has been operational at a higher tempo in 2022 than usual, with intrusions mainly geared towards Portuguese and Spanish speakers in Latin America, and to a lesser extent in Western Europe and North America.   Phishing campaigns mounted by the group involve sending malicious spam messages with reservation-themed lures such as hotel bookings that cont

Google's cloud division on Thursday disclosed it mitigated a series of HTTPS distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks which peaked at 46 million requests per second (RPS), making it the largest such recorded to date.  The attack, which occurred on June 1, targeting an unnamed Google Cloud Armor customer, is 76% larger than the  26 million RPS DDoS attack  repealed by Cloudflare earlier this June.   "To give a sense of the scale of the attack, that is like receiving all the daily requests to Wikipedia (one of the top 10 trafficked websites in the world) in just 10 seconds," Google Cloud's Emil Kiner and Satya Konduru  said .  It's said to have started around 9:45 a.m. PT with 10,000 RPS, before growing to 100,000 RPS eight minutes later and further ramping up within two minutes to hit a high of 46 million RPS at 10:18 a.m. PT.

New Amazon Ring Vulnerability Could Have Exposed All Your Camera Recordings<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/new-amazon-ring-vulnerability-could.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Retail giant Amazon patched a high-severity security issue in its Ring app for Android in May that could have enabled a rogue application installed on a user's device to access sensitive information and camera recordings.  The Ring app for Android has over 10 million downloads and enables users to monitor video feeds from smart home devices such as video doorbells, security cameras, and alarm systems. Amazon acquired the doorbell maker for about $1 billion in 2018.  Application security firm Checkmarx  explained  it identified a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw that it said could be weaponized as part of an attack chain to trick victims into installing a malicious app.   The app can then be used to get hold of the user's Authorization Token, that can be subsequently leveraged to extract the session cookie by sending this information alongside the device's hardware ID, which is also encoded in the token, to the endpoint "ring[.]com/mobile/authorize."

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A .NET-based evasive crypter named  DarkTortilla  has been used by threat actors to distribute a broad array of commodity malware as well as targeted payloads like Cobalt Strike and Metasploit, likely  since 2015 .  "It can also deliver 'add-on packages' such as additional malicious payloads, benign decoy documents, and executables," cybersecurity firm Secureworks  said  in a Wednesday report. "It features robust anti-analysis and anti-tamper controls that can make detection, analysis, and eradication challenging."  Malware delivered by the crypter includes information steakers and remote access trojans (RATs) such as Agent Tesla, AsyncRat, NanoCore, and RedLine Stealer. "DarkTortilla has versatility that similar malware does not," the researchers noted.   Crypters are  software tools  that use a  combination  of encryption, obfuscation, and code manipulation of malware so as to  bypass detection  by security solutions.  The delivery of DarkTortil

This also included the attack on Air India that came to light in June 2021 as part of a campaign codenamed  ColunmTK . The other three campaigns have been assigned the monikers DelayLinkTK, Mute-Pond, and Gentle-Voice based on the domain names used in the attacks.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The malware loader known as Bumblebee is being increasingly co-opted by threat actors associated with BazarLoader, TrickBot, and IcedID in their campaigns to breach target networks for post-exploitation activities.  "Bumblebee operators conduct intensive reconnaissance activities and redirect the output of executed commands to files for exfiltration," Cybereason researchers Meroujan Antonyan and Alon Laufer  said  in a technical write-up.   Bumblebee  first came to light in March 2022 when Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) unmasked the activities of an initial access broker dubbed  Exotic Lily  with ties to the  TrickBot  and the larger  Conti  collectives.   Typically delivered via initial access acquired through spear-phishing campaigns, the modus operandi has since been tweaked by eschewing macro-laced documents in favor of ISO and LNK files, primarily in response to Microsoft's decision to  block macros by default .

Penetration Testing or Vulnerability Scanning? What's the Difference?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/penetration-testing-or-vulnerability.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Pentesting and vulnerability scanning are often confused for the same service. The problem is, business owners often use one when they really need the other. Let's dive in and explain the differences.  People frequently confuse penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, and it's easy to see why. Both look for weaknesses in your IT infrastructure by exploring your systems in the same way an actual hacker would. However, there is a very important distinction between the two - and when each is the better option.  Manual or automated?  Penetration testing is a  manual  security assessment where cyber security professional attempts to find a way to break into your systems. It's a hands-on, in-depth test to evaluate security controls across a variety of systems, including web application, network and cloud environments. This kind of testing could take several weeks to complete, and due to its complexity and cost, is commonly carried out once a year.  Vulnerability scanning,

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple on Wednesday released security updates for  iOS, iPadOS , and  macOS  platforms to remediate two zero-day vulnerabilities previously exploited by threat actors to compromise its devices.  The list of issues is below -   CVE-2022-32893  - An out-of-bounds issue in WebKit which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code by processing a specially crafted web content  CVE-2022-32894  - An out-of-bounds issue in the operating system's Kernel that could be abused by a malicious application to execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges   Apple said it addressed both the issues with improved bounds checking, adding it's aware the vulnerabilities "may have been actively exploited."  The company did not disclose any additional information regarding these attacks or the identities of the threat actors perpetrating them, although it's likely that they were abused as part of highly-targeted intrusions.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In a sign that malicious actors continue to find ways to work around Google Play Store security protections, researchers have spotted a previously undocumented Android dropper trojan that's currently in development.  "This new malware tries to abuse devices using a novel technique, not seen before in Android malware, to spread the extremely dangerous  Xenomorph  banking trojan, allowing criminals to perform On-Device Fraud on victim's devices," ThreatFabric's Han Sahin said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.  Dubbed  BugDrop  by the Dutch security firm, the  dropper app  is explicitly designed to defeat new features introduced in the upcoming version of Android that aim to make it difficult for malware to request Accessibility Services privileges from victims.   ThreatFabric attributed the dropper to a cybercriminal group known as "Hadoken Security," which is also behind the creation and distribution of the  Xenomorph and Gymdrop  Android malwa

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday rolled out patches for Chrome browser for desktops to contain an actively exploited high-severity zero-day flaw in the wild.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-2856 , the issue has been described as a case of insufficient validation of untrusted input in  Intents . Security researchers Ashley Shen and Christian Resell of Google Threat Analysis Group have been credited with reporting the flaw on July 19, 2022.  As is typically the case, the tech giant has refrained from sharing additional specifics about the shortcoming until a majority of the users are updated. "Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2022-2856 exists in the wild," it  acknowledged  in a terse statement.  The latest update further addresses 10 other security flaws, most of which relate to use-after-free bugs in various components such as FedCM, SwiftShader, ANGLE, and Blink, among others. Also fixed is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in Downloads.   The development marks the fifth zero-day vulnerab

A Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group named RedAlpha  has been attributed to a multi-year mass credential theft campaign aimed at global humanitarian, think tank, and government organizations.  "In this activity, RedAlpha very likely sought to gain access to email accounts and other online communications of targeted individuals and organizations," Recorded Future  disclosed  in a new report.   A lesser-known threat actor, RedAlpha was first  documented  by Citizen Lab in January 2018 and has a history of conducting cyber espionage and surveillance operations directed against the Tibetan community, some in India, to facilitate intelligence collection through the deployment of the NjRAT backdoor .   "The campaigns [...] combine light reconnaissance, selective targeting, and diverse malicious tooling," Recorded Future  noted  at the time.  Since then, malicious activities undertaken by the group have involved weaponizing as many as 350 domains that spoof leg

Cobalt, Lazarus, MageCart, Evil, Revil — cybercrime syndicates spring up so fast it's hard to keep track. Until…they infiltrate  your  system. But you know what's even more overwhelming than rampant cybercrime?  Building your organization's security framework.   CIS, NIST, PCI DSS, HIPAA, HITrust, and the list goes on. Even if you had the resources to implement every relevant industry standard and control to a tee, you still couldn't keep your company from getting caught up in the next SolarWinds. Because textbook security and check-the-box compliance won't cut it. You've got to be strategic ( especially when manpower is limited! ). And lean.  Learn the ropes now.   3 Pro Tips for Building Your Lean Security Framework  Without a framework in place, you're either navigating the cyber-risk universe with blinders on — or buried so deep in false positives you couldn't spot a complex attack until it's already laterally advancing.

Malicious Browser Extensions Targeted Over a Million Users So Far This Year<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/malicious-browser-extensions-targeted.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More than 1.31 million users attempted to install malicious or unwanted web browser extensions at least once, new findings from cybersecurity firm Kaspersky show.  "From January 2020 to June 2022, more than 4.3 million unique users were attacked by adware hiding in browser extensions, which is approximately 70% of all users affected by malicious and unwanted add-ons," the company  said .  As many as 1,311,557 users fall under this category in the first half of 2022, per Kaspersky's telemetry data. In comparison, the number of such users peaked in 2020 at 3,660,236, followed by 1,823,263 unique users in 2021.  The most prevalent threat is a family of adware called WebSearch, which masquerade as PDF viewers and other utilities, and comes with capabilities to collect and analyze search queries and redirect users to affiliate links.   WebSearch is also notable for modifying the browser's start page, which contains a search engine and a number of links to third-party sour

North Korea Hackers Spotted Targeting Job Seekers with macOS Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/north-korea-hackers-spotted-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korea-backed Lazarus Group has been observed targeting job seekers with malware capable of executing on Apple Macs with Intel and M1 chipsets.  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET linked it to a campaign dubbed " Operation In(ter)ception " that was first disclosed in June 2020 and involved using social engineering tactics to trick employees working in the aerospace and military sectors into opening decoy job offer documents.  The latest attack is no different in that a job description for the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange platform was used as a launchpad to drop a signed Mach-O executable. ESET's analysis comes from a sample of the binary that was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil on August 11, 2022.   "Malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon," the company  said  in a series of tweets. "It drops three files: a decoy PDF document ' Coinbase_online_careers_2022_07.pdf ', a bundle  'FinderFontsUpdater.app ,' and a downloa

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
RubyGems, the official package manager for the Ruby programming language, has become the latest platform to mandate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for popular package maintainers, following the footsteps of  NPM  and  PyPI .  To that end, owners of gems with over 180 million total downloads are mandated to turn on MFA effective August 15, 2022.   "Users in this category who do not have MFA enabled on the UI and API or UI and gem sign-in level will not be able to edit their profile on the web, perform privileged actions (i.e. push and yank gems, or add and remove gem owners), or sign in on the command line until they configure MFA," RubyGems  noted .  What's more, gem maintainers who cross 165 million cumulative downloads are expected to receive reminders to turn on MFA until the download count touches the 180 million thresholds, at which point it will be made mandatory.  The development is seen as an attempt by package ecosystems to  bolster the software supply chain

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of researchers has revealed details of a new vulnerability affecting Intel CPUs that enables attackers to obtain encryption keys and other secret information from the processors.  Dubbed  ÆPIC Leak , the weakness is the first-of-its-kind to architecturally disclose sensitive data in a manner that's akin to an "uninitialized memory read in the CPU itself."  "In contrast to transient execution attacks like  Meltdown and Spectre ,  ÆPIC Leak  is an architectural bug: the sensitive data gets directly disclosed without relying on any (noisy) side channel," the academics said.  The study was conducted by researchers from the Sapienza University of Rome, the Graz University of Technology, Amazon Web Services, and the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security.  The vulnerability ( CVE-2022-21233 , CVSS score: 6.0), which affects CPUs with Sunny Cover microarchitecture, is rooted in a component called Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller ( APIC ), wh

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have elaborated a novel attack technique that weaponizes programmable logic controllers ( PLCs ) to gain an initial foothold in engineering workstations and subsequently invade the operational technology (OT) networks.  Dubbed " Evil PLC " attack by industrial security firm Claroty, the issue impacts engineering workstation software from Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric, GE, B&R, Xinje, OVARRO, and Emerson.  Programmable logic controllers are a crucial component of industrial devices that control manufacturing processes in critical infrastructure sectors. PLCs, besides orchestrating the automation tasks, are also configured to start and stop processes and generate alarms.  It's hence not surprising that the entrenched access provided by PLCs have made the machines a focus of sophisticated attacks for more than a decade, starting from  Stuxnet to PIPEDREAM  (aka INCONTROLLER), with the goal of causing physical disruptions.    "The

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
UTM (Unified threat management) is thought to be an all-in-one solution for cybersecurity. In general, it is a versatile software or hardware firewall solution integrated with IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and other security services. A universal gateway allows the user to manage network security with one comprehensive solution, which makes the task much easier. In addition, compared to a conventional firewall, such systems are capable of detecting and blocking more sophisticated attacks. SafeDNS has recently released such a solution, and this is what this article is going to be about.  Who needs UTMs?  Most of all, UTMs are valued by SMEs - the all-in-one solution makes it simple to manage all their cybersecurity solutions and services. This also cuts down a lot of communications between vendors, since UTMs are easily supported by one IT team. This leads to another upside of the system - it can be cost-effective, as there is no need to pay a bunch of vendors & extra for tech

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Russian state-sponsored actors are continuing to strike Ukrainian entities with information-stealing malware as part of what's suspected to be an espionage operation.  Symantec, a division of Broadcom Software,  attributed  the malicious campaign to a threat actor tracked  Shuckworm , also known as  Actinium ,  Armageddon , Gamaredon, Primitive Bear, and Trident Ursa. The findings have been  corroborated  by the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA).  The threat actor, active since at least 2013, is known for explicitly singling out public and private entities in Ukraine. The attacks have since ratcheted up in the wake of Russia's military invasion in late 2022.   The latest set of attacks are said to have commenced on July 15, 2022, and ongoing as recently as August 8, with the infection chains leveraging phishing emails disguised as newsletters and combat orders, ultimately leading to the deployment of a PowerShell stealer malware dubbed  GammaLoad.PS1_v2 .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Popular end-to-end encrypted messaging service Signal on Monday disclosed the cyberattack aimed at Twilio earlier this month may have exposed the phone numbers of roughly 1,900 users.  "For about 1,900 users, an attacker could have attempted to re-register their number to another device or learned that their number was registered to Signal," the company  said . "All users can rest assured that their message history, contact lists, profile information, whom they'd blocked, and other personal data remain private and secure and were not affected."  Signal, which uses Twilio to send SMS verification codes to users registering with the app, said it's in the process of alerting the affected users directly and prompting them to re-register the service on their devices.   The development comes less than a week after Twilio  revealed  that data associated with about 125 customer accounts were accessed by malicious actors through a phishing attack that duped the comp

Credential Theft Is (Still) A Top Attack Method<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/credential-theft-is-still-top-attack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Credential theft is clearly still a problem. Even after years of warnings, changing password requirements, and multiple forms of authentication,  password  stealing remains a top attack method used by cyber criminals.  The latest  report  from the Ponemon Institute shares that 54% of security incidents were caused by credential theft, followed by ransomware and DDoS attacks. 59% of organizations aren't revoking credentials that are no longer needed, meaning passwords can go unattended and dormant like a sitting duck (similar to what happened with Colonial Pipeline). And  Verizon's Data Breach Investigations Report  cites that nearly 50% of all data breaches were caused by stolen credentials.  The stats don't lie. Cybercriminals are advancing, there's no doubt, but if there's an option to take the path of least resistance, they'll take it. Too often, that means compromising passwords and exploiting vulnerable access points.   Credential Theft and Critical Access

A now-removed rogue package pushed to the official third-party software repository for Python has been found to deploy cryptominers on Linux systems.

"On a closer inspection though, the package covertly runs cryptominers on your Linux machine in-memory (directly from your RAM), a technique largely employed by fileless malware and crypters," Sonatype researcher Ax Sharma  disclosed  in a report last week.  It achieves this by executing a Linux executable file retrieved from a remote server post installation, whose main task is to drop an  ELF  file (" memfd ") directly in memory that functions as a Monero cryptominer, after which it gets deleted by the "secretslib" package.   "The malicious activity leaves little to n

Tornado Cash Developer Arrested After U.S. Sanctions the Cryptocurrency Mixer<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/tornado-cash-developer-arrested-after.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Dutch authorities on Friday announced the arrest of a software developer in Amsterdam who is alleged to be working for Tornado Cash, days after the U.S. sanctioned the decentralized crypto mixing service.  The 29-year-old individual is "suspected of involvement in concealing criminal financial flows and facilitating money laundering" through the service, the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD)  said  in a statement.  Although FIOD didn't reveal the name of the Tornado Cash engineer, The Block  identified  him as Alexey Pertsev, citing confirmation from his wife. "My husband didn't do anything illegal," she was quoted as saying.   FIOD also alleged that "Tornado Cash has been used to conceal large-scale criminal money flows, including from (online) thefts of cryptocurrencies (so-called crypto hacks and scams)."  The agency, which initiated an investigation into Tornado Cash in June 2022, further hinted it may make more arrests

A pair of reports from cybersecurity firms  SEKOIA  and  Trend Micro  sheds light on a new campaign undertaken by a Chinese threat actor named Lucky Mouse  that involves leveraging a trojanized version of a cross-platform messaging app to backdoor systems.  Infection chains leverage a chat application called MiMi, with its installer files compromised to download and install HyperBro samples for the Windows operating system and rshell artifacts for Linux and macOS.  As many as 13 different entities located in Taiwan and the Philippines have been at the receiving end of the attacks, eight of whom have been hit with rshell. The first victim of rshell was reported in mid-July 2021.  Lucky Mouse, also called  APT27 , Bronze Union, Emissary Panda, and Iron Tiger, is known to be active since 2013 and has a history of gaining access to targeted networks in pursuit of its political and military intelligence-collection objectives aligned with China.

A security feature bypass vulnerability has been uncovered in three signed third-party Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) boot loaders that allow bypass of the UEFI Secure Boot feature.

The following  vendor-specific boot loaders , which were signed and authenticated by Microsoft, have been found vulnerable to the bypass and have been patched as part of the tech giant's  Patch Tuesday update  released this week -   Eurosoft Boot Loader ( CVE-2022-34301 )  New Horizon Data Systems Inc Boot Loader ( CVE-2022-34302 ), and  Crypto Pro Boot Loader ( CVE-20220-34303 )   Secure Boot is a  security standard  designed to thwart malicious programs from loading whe

Xiaomi Phones with MediaTek Chips Found Vulnerable to Forged Payments<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/xiaomi-phones-with-mediatek-chips-found.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security flaws have been identified in Xiaomi Redmi Note 9T and Redmi Note 11 models, which could be exploited to disable the mobile payment mechanism and even forge transactions via a rogue Android app installed on the devices.  Check Point said it found the flaws in devices powered by MediaTek chipsets during a security analysis of the Chinese handset maker's "Kinibi" Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).  A TEE refers to a  secure enclave  inside the main processor that's used to process and store sensitive information such as cryptographic keys so as to ensure confidentiality and integrity.   Specifically, the Israeli cybersecurity firm discovered that a trusted app on a Xiaomi device can be downgraded due to a lack of version control, enabling an attacker to replace a newer, secure version of an app with an older, vulnerable variant.  "Therefore, an attacker can bypass security fixes made by Xiaomi or MediaTek in trusted apps by downgrading them to unpatched

The U.S. State Department on Thursday  announced  a $10 million reward for information related to five individuals associated with the Conti ransomware group.  The reward offer, first  reported  by WIRED, is also notable for the fact that it marks the first time the face of a Conti associate, known as "Target," has been unmasked. The four other associates have been referred to as "Tramp," "Dandis," "Professor," and "Reshaev."  The government, besides seeking information about the five operators that could lead to their identification or location, is also calling on people to share details about Conti and its affiliated groups  TrickBot  and  Wizard Spider .   Since its rebrand from Ryuk to Conti, the transnational organized crime group has been linked to hundreds of ransomware incidents over the past two years.  As of January 2022, the Russia-based ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation is estimated to have hit over 1,000 entities, w

Social media company Meta said it will begin testing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on its Messenger platform this week for select users as the default option, as the company continues to slowly add security layers to its various chat services.  "If you're in the test group, some of your most frequent chats may be automatically end-to-end encrypted, which means you won't have to opt in to the feature," Sara Su, product management director of Messenger Trust,  said .  The incremental development comes a year after it  turned on E2EE  for audio and video calls on the messaging service as well as for one-on-one chats in Instagram, and enabled  encrypted chat backups  for WhatsApp on Android and iOS.   E2EE is a secure communication mechanism that scrambles data in transit and prevents third-parties from unauthorizedly accessing information sent from one endpoint to another, including Meta.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco on Wednesday released patches to contain multiple flaws in its software that could be abused to leak sensitive information on susceptible appliances.  The issue, assigned the identifier  CVE-2022-20866  (CVSS score: 7.4), has been described as a "logic error" when handling RSA keys on devices running Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.  Successful exploitation of the flaw could allow an attacker to retrieve the RSA private key by means of a  Lenstra side-channel attack  against the targeted device.  "If an attacker obtains the RSA private key, they could use the key to impersonate a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software or to decrypt the device traffic," Cisco warned in an advisory issued on August 10.   Cisco noted that the flaw impacts only Cisco ASA Software releases 9.16.1 and later and Cisco FTD Software releases 7.0.0 and later. Affected products are listed below -

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Back when the internet consisted of a handful of computers networked together across a few research institutions, nobody could have imagined that it would one day form the backbone of a new digital way of life. And that probably explains why none of the researchers who thought up its core technologies — things like packet switching and TCP/IP — gave much consideration to the need to secure the data passing through it.  But by 1989, hackers like Robert Morris had already spotted the security weaknesses of the fledgling global network and started to exploit them. And that was just the beginning. Today, network administrators and individual internet users spend significant amounts of time and money trying to keep their data safe from prying eyes.  The de-facto tool most people use for that purpose is a VPN. It's a software encryption solution that prevents anyone from accessing data traversing the public internet other than its intended recipient. And VPNs make up a data privacy mark

A trio of offshoots from the notorious Conti cybercrime cartel have resorted to the technique of call-back phishing as an initial access vector to breach targeted networks.  "Three autonomous threat groups have since adopted and independently developed their own targeted phishing tactics derived from the call back phishing methodology," cybersecurity firm AdvIntel  said  in a Wednesday report.  These targeted campaigns "substantially increased" attacks against entities in finance, technology, legal, and insurance sectors, the company added.  The actors in question include Silent Ransom, Quantum, and Roy/Zeon, all of which split from Conti after the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) cartel  orchestrated its shutdown  in May 2022 following its public support for Russia in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict.   The advanced social engineering tactic, also called  BazaCall  (aka BazarCall), came under the spotlight in 2020/2021 when it was put to use by operators of the

"The user had enabled password syncing via Google Chrome and had stored their Cisco credentials in their browser, enabling that information to synchronize to their Google account."  The disclosure comes as cybercriminal actors associated with the Yanluowang ransomware gang  published a list of files  from the breach to their data leak site on August 10.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the Cuba ransomware have been linked to previously undocumented tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), including a new remote access trojan called ROMCOM RAT  on compromised systems.  The  new findings  come from Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team, which is tracking the double extortion ransomware group under the  constellation-themed moniker   Tropical Scorpius .  Cuba ransomware (aka  COLDDRAW ), which was first detected in December 2019, reemerged on the threat landscape in November 2021 and has been attributed to attacks against 60 entities in five critical infrastructure sectors, amassing at least $43.9 million in ransom payments.  Of the 60 victims listed on its data leak site, 40 are located in the U.S., indicating a not as global distribution of targeted organizations as other ransomware gangs.  "Cuba ransomware is distributed through Hancitor malware, a loader known for dropping or executing stealers, such as Remote

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Password security is only as strong as the password itself. Unfortunately, we are often reminded of the danger of weak, reused, and compromised passwords with major cybersecurity breaches that start with stolen credentials. For example, in May 2022, the popular wedding planning site, Zola, was the victim of a significant cybersecurity breach where hackers used an attack known as  credential stuffing . It resulted in fraudulent activity tied to customer accounts. Let's look at the Zola breach and why it emphasizes the need for organizations to bolster their password security and protect against various types of password attacks.  What happened with the Zola attack?  Instead of going after Zola's core business-critical infrastructure, hackers went after customer accounts with the May attack. Attackers used an age-old technique called  credential stuffing  to compromise several Zola customer accounts. With access to the compromised accounts, they attempted to purchase gift vouche

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed multiple severe security vulnerabilities asset management platform  Device42  that, if successfully exploited, could enable a malicious actor to seize control of affected systems.  "By exploiting these issues, an attacker could impersonate other users, obtain admin-level access in the application (by leaking session with an  LFI ) or obtain full access to the appliance files and database (through remote code execution)," Bitdefender  said  in a Wednesday report.   Even more concerningly, an adversary with any level of access within the host network could daisy-chain three of the flaws to bypass authentication protections and achieve remote code execution with the highest privileges.   The issues in question are listed below -   CVE-2022-1399  - Remote Code Execution in scheduled tasks component  CVE-2022-1400  - Hard-coded encryption key IV in Exago WebReportsApi.dll  CVE 2022-1401  - Insufficient validation of provided paths in Exago

A former Twitter employee has been pronounced guilty for his role in digging up private information pertaining to certain Twitter users and turning over that data to Saudi Arabia.  Ahmad Abouammo, 44, was convicted by a jury after a two-week trial in San Francisco federal court, Bloomberg  reported  Tuesday. He faces up to 20 years in prison when sentenced.  The  verdict  comes nearly three years after Abouammo, along with Ali Alzabarah and Ahmed Almutairi (Ahmed Aljbreen) were  indicted in 2019  for acting as "illegal agents" of Saudi Arabia, with the former also charged with destroying, altering, and falsifying records in a federal investigation.   Prosecutors accused Abouammo and Alzabarah, both of whom joined Twitter in 2013, of being enlisted by officials of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for  unmasking its critics  on the social media platform.  According to court documents, both individuals leveraged their access to internal systems to unauthorizedly get hold of nonpubli

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The first ever incident possibly involving the ransomware family known as Maui occurred on April 15, 2021, aimed at an unnamed Japanese housing company.  The disclosure from Kaspersky arrives a month after U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies issued an  advisory  about the use of the ransomware strain by North Korean government-backed hackers to target the healthcare sector since at least May 2021.  Much of the data about its modus operandi came from incident response activities and industry analysis of a Maui sample that revealed a lack of "several key features" typically associated with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations.  Not only is Maui designed to be manually executed by a remote actor via a command-line interface, it's also notable for not including a ransom note to provide recovery instructions.   Subsequently, the Justice Department  announced  the seizure of $500,000 worth of Bitcoin that were extorted from several organizations, including two he

Today's web has made hackers' tasks remarkably easy. For the most part, hackers don't even have to hide in the dark recesses of the web to take advantage of people any longer; they can be found right in plain sight on social media sites or forums, professionally advertised with their websites, and may even approach you anonymously through such channels as Twitter.  Cybercrime has entered a new era where people don't steal just for the thrill of doing it anymore. They make it their business to carry out illegal cyber activities in small groups or individually to earn business from online criminals, selling offensive services like spyware as a service or commercial cybersecurity.  For instance, a series of new DDoS for Hire are commoditizing the art of hacking and reducing the barrier to launching  DDoS attacks .  Who are Hackers-for-Hire?   Hackers-for-hire are secret cyber experts or groups who specialize in infiltrating organizations to acquire intelligence in one way

Web infrastructure company Cloudflare on Tuesday disclosed at least 76 employees and their family members received text messages on their personal and work phones bearing similar characteristics as that of the sophisticated  phishing attack against Twilio .  The attack, which transpired around the same time Twilio was targeted, came from four phone numbers associated with T-Mobile-issued SIM cards and was ultimately unsuccessful.  The text messages pointed to a seemingly legitimate domain containing the keywords "Cloudflare" and "Okta" in an attempt to deceive the employees into handing over their credentials.   The wave of over 100 smishing messages commenced less than 40 minutes after the rogue domain was registered via Porkbun, the company noted, adding the phishing page was designed to relay the credentials entered by unsuspecting users to the attacker via Telegram in real-time.   This also meant that the attack could defeat 2FA roadblocks, as the Time-based On

CISA Issues Warning on Active Exploitation of UnRAR Software for Linux Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/cisa-issues-warning-on-active.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday added a recently disclosed security flaw in the UnRAR utility to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.  Tracked as CVE-2022-30333 (CVSS score: 7.5), the issue concerns a path traversal vulnerability in the Unix versions of UnRAR that can be triggered upon extracting a maliciously crafted RAR archive.  This means that an adversary could exploit the flaw to drop arbitrary files on a target system that has the utility installed simply by decompressing the file. The vulnerability was  revealed  by SonarSource researcher Simon Scannell in late June.   "RARLAB UnRAR on Linux and UNIX contains a directory traversal vulnerability, allowing an attacker to write to files during an extract (unpack) operation," the agency  said  in an advisory.  Not much is known about the nature of the attacks, but the disclosure is evidence of a growing trend wherein threat acto

As many as  121 new security flaws  were patched by Microsoft as part of its Patch Tuesday updates for the month of August, which also includes a fix for a Support Diagnostic Tool vulnerability that the company said is being actively exploited in the wild.  Of the 121 bugs, 17 are rated Critical, 102 are rated Important, one is rated Moderate, and one is rated Low in severity. Two of the issues have been listed as publicly known at the time of the release.  It's worth noting that the 121 security flaws are in addition to  25 shortcomings  the tech giant addressed in its Chromium-based Edge browser late last month and the previous week.  Topping the list of patches is  CVE-2022-34713  (CVSS score: 7.8), a case of remote code execution affecting the Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), making it the second flaw in the same component after  Follina  (CVE-2022-30190) to be weaponized in  real-world attacks  within three months.

Customer engagement platform Twilio on Monday disclosed that a "sophisticated" threat actor gained "unauthorized access" using an SMS-based phishing campaign aimed at its staff to gain information on a "limited number" of accounts.  The social-engineering attack was bent on stealing employee credentials, the company said, calling the as-yet-unidentified adversary "well-organized" and "methodical in their actions." The incident came to light on August 4.  "This broad based attack against our employee base succeeded in fooling some employees into providing their credentials," it  said  in a notice. "The attackers then used the stolen credentials to gain access to some of our internal systems, where they were able to access certain customer data."

U.S. Sanctions Virtual Currency Mixer Tornado Cash for Alleged Use in Laundering<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/us-sanctions-virtual-currency-mixer.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday placed sanctions against crypto mixing service Tornado Cash, citing its use by the North Korea-backed Lazarus Group in the high-profile hacks of Ethereum bridges to launder and cash out the ill-gotten money.  Tornado Cash, which allows users to move cryptocurrency assets between accounts by obfuscating their origin and destination, is estimated to have been used to launder more than $7.6 billion worth of virtual assets since its creation in 2019, the department said.  Thefts, hacks, and fraud account for $1.54 billion of the total assets sent through the mixer, according to blockchain analytics firm  Elliptic .  Crypto mixing is akin to shuffling digital currencies through a black box, blending a certain quantity of digital funds in private pools before transferring it to its designated receivers for a fee. The aim is to make transactions anonymous and difficult to trace.   "Despite public assurances otherwise, Tornado Cash has repeatedly fa

The Truth About False Positives in Security<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/the-truth-about-false-positives-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
TL;DR: As weird as it might sound, seeing a few false positives reported by a security scanner is probably a good sign and certainly better than seeing none. Let's explain why.  Introduction  False positives have made a somewhat unexpected appearance in our lives in recent years. I am, of course, referring to the COVID-19 pandemic, which required massive testing campaigns in order to control the spread of the virus. For the record, a false positive is a result that appears positive (for COVID-19 in our case), where it is actually negative (the person is not infected). More commonly, we speak of false alarms.  In computer security, we are also often confronted with false positives. Ask the security team behind any SIEM what their biggest operational challenge is, and chances are that false positives will be mentioned. A recent  report  estimates that as much as 20% of all the alerts received by security professionals are false positives, making it a big source of fatigue.  Yet the

In what's yet another instance of malicious packages creeping into public code repositories, 10 modules have been removed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) for their ability to harvest critical data points such as passwords and Api tokens.  The packages "install info-stealers that enable attackers to steal developer's private data and personal credentials," Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point  said  in a Monday report.   A short summary of the offending packages is below -   Ascii2text , which downloads a nefarious script that gathers passwords stored in web browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and Yandex Browser  Pyg-utils, Pymocks, and PyProto2 , which are designed to  steal users' AWS credentials  Test-async and Zlibsrc , which download and execute malicious code during installation  Free-net-vpn, Free-net-vpn2, and WINRPCexploit , which steal user credentials and environment variables, and  Browserdiv , which are capable of coll

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Over a dozen military-industrial complex enterprises and public institutions in Afghanistan and Europe have come under a wave of targeted attacks since January 2022 to steal confidential data by simultaneously making use of six different backdoors.  Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky  attributed  the attacks "with a high degree of confidence" to a China-linked threat actor tracked by  Proofpoint  as  TA428 , citing overlaps in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).   TA428, also tracked under the names Bronze Dudley, Temp.Hex, and Vicious Panda, has a  history  of striking entities in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and Mongolia. It's believed to share connections with another hacking group called Mustang Panda (aka Bronze President).   Targets of the latest cyber espionage campaign included industrial plants, design bureaus and research institutes, government agencies, ministries and departments in several East European countries and Afghanistan.

New Orchard Botnet Uses Bitcoin Founder's Account Info to Generate Malicious Domains<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/new-orchard-botnet-uses-bitcoin.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new botnet named Orchard has been observed using Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's account transaction information to generate domain names to conceal its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.  "Because of the uncertainty of Bitcoin transactions, this technique is more unpredictable than using the common time-generated [ domain generation algorithms ], and thus more difficult to defend against," researchers from Qihoo 360's Netlab security team said  in a Friday write-up.  Orchard is said to have undergone three revisions since February 2021, with the botnet primarily used to deploy additional payloads onto a victim's machine and execute commands received from the C2 server.   It's also designed to upload device and user information as well as infect USB storage devices to propagate the malware. Netlab's analysis shows that over 3,000 hosts have been enslaved by the malware to date, most of them located in China.  Orchard has also been subjected to

A few days ago, a friend and I were having a rather engaging conversation that sparked my excitement. We were discussing my prospects of becoming a red teamer as a natural career progression. The reason I got stirred up is not that I want to change either my job or my position, as I am a happy camper being part of Cymulate's blue team.  What upset me was that my friend could not grasp the idea that I wanted to keep working as a blue teamer because, as far as he was concerned, the only natural progression is to move to the red team.   Red teams include many roles ranging from penetration testers to attackers and exploit developers. These roles attract most of the buzz, and the many certifications revolving around these roles (OSCP, OSEP, CEH) make them seem fancy. Movies usually make hackers the heroes, while typically ignoring the defending side, the complexities and challenges of blue teamers' roles are far less known.  While blue teams' defending roles might not sound as

A sophisticated scam-as-a-service operation dubbed Classiscam  has now infiltrated into Singapore, more than 1.5 years after  expanding to Europe .  "Scammers posing as legitimate buyers approach sellers with the request to purchase goods from their listings and the ultimate aim of stealing payment data," Group-IB  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The cybersecurity firm called the operators a "well-coordinated and technologically advanced scammer criminal network."  Classiscam refers to a  Russia-based cybercrime operation  that was first recorded in summer 2019 but only came under spotlight a year later coinciding with a surge in activity owing to an increase in online shopping in the aftermath of COVID-19 outbreak.  Called the  most widely used fraud scheme  during the pandemic, Classiscam targets people who use marketplaces and services relating to property rentals, hotel bookings, online bank transfers, online retail, ride-sharing, and package de

The first set of activities is what the company described as "persistent and well-resourced" and undertaken by a hacking group tracked under the moniker Bitter APT (aka APT-C-08 or T-APT-17) targeting individuals in New Zealand, India, Pakistan, and the U.K.  "Bitter used various malicious tactics to target people online with social engineering and infect their devices with malware," Meta  said  in its Quarterly Adversarial Threat Report. "They used a mix of link-shortening services, malicious domains, compromised websites, and third-party hosting providers to distribute their malware."

New IoT RapperBot Malware Targeting Linux Servers via SSH Brute-Forcing Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/new-iot-rapperbot-malware-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new IoT botnet malware dubbed RapperBot  has been observed rapidly evolving its capabilities since it was first discovered in mid-June 2022.  "This family borrows heavily from the original  Mirai source code , but what separates it from other IoT malware families is its built-in capability to brute force credentials and gain access to SSH servers instead of Telnet as implemented in Mirai," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs  said  in a report.  The malware, which gets its name from an embedded URL to a YouTube rap music video in an earlier version, is said to have amassed a growing collection of compromised SSH servers, with over 3,500 unique IP addresses used to scan and brute-force their way into the servers.   RapperBot's current implementation also delineates it from Mirai, allowing it to primarily function as an SSH brute-force tool with limited capabilities to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.  The deviation from traditional Mirai behavior is further

Hackers Exploit Twitter Vulnerability to Exposes 5.4 Million Accounts<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/hackers-exploit-twitter-vulnerability.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Twitter on Friday revealed that a now-patched zero-day bug was used to link phone numbers and emails to user accounts on the social media platform.  "As a result of the vulnerability, if someone submitted an email address or phone number to Twitter's systems, Twitter's systems would tell the person what Twitter account the submitted email addresses or phone number was associated with, if any," the company  said  in an advisory.   Twitter said the bug, which it was  made aware  of in January 2022, stemmed from a code change introduced in June 2021. No passwords were exposed as a result of the incident.  The six-month delay in making this public stems from new evidence last month that an unidentified actor had potentially taken advantage of the flaw before the fix to scrape user information and sell it for profit on  Breach Forums .  Although Twitter didn't reveal the exact number of impacted users, the forum post made by the threat actor shows that the flaw was ex

Slack Resets Passwords After a Bug Exposed Hashed Passwords for Some Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/slack-resets-passwords-after-bug.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Slack said it took the step of resetting passwords for about 0.5% of its users after a flaw exposed salted password hashes when creating or revoking shared invitation links for workspaces.  "When a user performed either of these actions, Slack transmitted a hashed version of their password to other workspace members," the enterprise communication and collaboration platform  said  in an alert on 4th August.   Hashing refers to a cryptographic technique that transforms any form of data into a fixed-size output (called a hash value or simply hash).  Salting  is designed to add an extra security layer to the hashing process to make it resistant to brute-force attempts.  The Salesforce-owned company, which reported more than  12 million daily active users  in September 2019, didn't reveal the exact  hashing algorithm  used to safeguard the passwords.  The bug is said to have impacted all users who created or revoked shared invitation links between 17 April 2017 and 17 July 20

Iranian Hackers likely Behind Disruptive Cyberattacks Against Albanian Government<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/iranian-hackers-likely-behind.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor working to further Iranian goals is said to have been behind a set of disruptive cyberattacks against Albanian government services in mid-July 2022.  Cybersecurity firm Mandiant  said  the malicious activity against a NATO state represented a "geographic expansion of Iranian disruptive cyber operations."  The  July 17 attacks , according to Albania's National Agency of Information Society, forced the government to "temporarily close access to online public services and other government websites" because of a "synchronized and sophisticated cybercriminal attack from outside Albania."  The politically motivated disruptive operation, per Mandiant, entailed the deployment of a new ransomware family called ROADSWEEP that included a ransom note with the text: "Why should our taxes be spent on the benefit of DURRES terrorists?"   A front named HomeLand Justice has since claimed credit for the cyber offensive, with the group also alle

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has warned of critical security vulnerabilities in Emergency Alert System (EAS) encoder/decoder devices.  If left unpatched, the issues could allow an adversary to issue fraudulent emergency alerts over TV, radio, and cable networks.  The August 1 advisory comes courtesy of DHS' Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). CYBIR security researcher Ken Pyle has been credited with discovering the shortcoming.   EAS is a U.S. national  public warning system  that enables state authorities to disseminate information within 10 minutes during an emergency. Such alerts can interrupt radio and television to broadcast emergency alert information.   Details of the flaw have been kept under wraps to prevent active exploitation by malicious actors, although it's expected to be publicized as a proof-of-concept at the DEF CON conference to be held in Las Vegas next week.

Conflicting business requirements is a common problem – and you find it in every corner of an organization, including in information technology. Resolving these conflicts is a must, but it isn't always easy – though sometimes there is a novel solution that helps.  In IT management there is a constant struggle between security and operations teams. Yes, both teams ultimately want to have secure systems that are harder to breach. However, security can come at the expense of availability – and vice versa. In this article, we'll look at the availability vs. security conflict, and a solution that helps to resolve that conflict.  Ops team focus on availability… security teams lock down  Operations teams will always have stability, and therefore availability, as a top priority. Yes, ops teams will make security a priority too but only as far as it touches on either stability or availability, never as an absolute goal.

A nascent service called Dark Utilities  has already attracted 3,000 users for its ability to provide command-and-control (C2) services with the goal of commandeering compromised systems.  "It is marketed as a means to enable remote access, command execution, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and cryptocurrency mining operations on infected systems," Cisco Talos  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Dark Utilities, which emerged in early 2022, is advertised as a "C2-as-a-Service" (C2aaS), offering access to infrastructure hosted on the clearnet as well as the TOR network and associated payloads with support for Windows, Linux, and Python-based implementations for a mere €9.99.   Authenticated users on the platform are presented with a dashboard that makes it possible to generate new payloads tailored to a specific operating system that can then be deployed and executed on victim hosts.  Additionally, users are provided an administrative panel

CISA Adds Zimbra Email Vulnerability to its Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/cisa-adds-zimbra-email-vulnerability-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Thursday added a recently disclosed high-severity vulnerability in the Zimbra email suite to its  Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog , citing  evidence of active exploitation .  The issue in question is  CVE-2022-27924  (CVSS score: 7.5), a command injection flaw in the platform that could lead to the execution of arbitrary Memcached commands and theft of sensitive information.   "Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) allows an attacker to inject memcached commands into a targeted instance which causes an overwrite of arbitrary cached entries," CISA said.  Specifically, the bug relates to a case of insufficient validation of user input that, if successfully exploited, could enable attackers to steal cleartext credentials from users of targeted Zimbra instances.   The issue was  disclosed  by SonarSource in June, with  patches  released by Zimbra on May 10, 2022, in versions 8.8.15 P31.1 and 9.0.0 P24.1.  CISA hasn

Imagine this: a company-wide lockout to the company CRM, like Salesforce, because the organization's external admin attempts to disable MFA for themselves. They don't think to consult with the security team and don't consider the security implications, only the ease which they need for their team to use their login.   This CRM, however, defines MFA as a top-tier security setting; for example, Salesforce has a "High Assurance Login Value" configuration and immediately locks out all users as a safety precaution. The entire organization hits a standstill and is frustrated and confused.   Deeply concerning, this is not a one-off event, admins for business-critical SaaS apps often sit outside the security department and have profound control. Untrained and not focused on security measures, these admins are working towards their departmental KPIs. For instance, Hubspot is usually owned by the marketing department, likewise, Salesforce is often owned by the business dep

As many as 29 different router models from DrayTek have been identified as affected by a new critical, unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability that, if successfully exploited, could lead to full compromise of the devices and unauthorized access to the broader network.  "The attack can be performed without user interaction if the management interface of the device has been configured to be internet facing," Trellix researcher Philippe Laulheret  said . "A one-click attack can also be performed from within the LAN in the default device configuration."  Filed under CVE-2022-32548, the vulnerability has received the maximum severity rating of 10.0 on the CVSS scoring system, owing to its ability to completely allow an adversary to seize control of the routers.   At its core, the shortcoming is the result of a buffer overflow flaw in the web management interface ("/cgi-bin/wlogin.cgi"), which can be weaponized by a malicious actor by supplying spec

New Woody RAT Malware Being Used to Target Russian Organizations<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/new-woody-rat-malware-being-used-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been targeting Russian entities with a newly discovered remote access trojan called Woody RAT  for at least a year as part of a spear-phishing campaign.  The advanced custom backdoor is said to be delivered via either of two methods: archive files or Microsoft Office documents leveraging the now-patched "Follina" support diagnostic tool vulnerability ( CVE-2022-30190 ) in Windows.  Like other implants engineered for espionage-oriented operations, Woody RAT sports a wide range of features that enables the threat actor to remotely commandeer and steal sensitive information from the infected systems.  "The earliest versions of this RAT were typically archived into a ZIP file pretending to be a document specific to a Russian group," Malwarebytes researchers Ankur Saini and Hossein Jazi  said  in a Wednesday report.   "When the Follina vulnerability became known to the world, the threat actor switched to it to distribute the payload.&quo

Hackers Exploited Atlassian Confluence Bug to Deploy Ljl Backdoor for Espionage<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/hackers-exploited-atlassian-confluence.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor is said to have "highly likely" exploited a security flaw in an outdated Atlassian Confluence server to deploy a never-before-seen backdoor against an unnamed organization in the research and technical services sector.  The attack, which transpired over a seven-day-period during the end of May, has been attributed to a threat activity cluster tracked by cybersecurity firm Deepwatch as  TAC-040 .  "The evidence indicates that the threat actor executed malicious commands with a parent process of tomcat9.exe in Atlassian's Confluence directory," the company  said . "After the initial compromise, the threat actor ran various commands to enumerate the local system, network, and Active Directory environment."   The Atlassian vulnerability suspected to have been exploited is  CVE-2022-26134 , an Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) injection flaw that paves the way for arbitrary code execution on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance.

Phishing incidents are on the rise. A report from IBM  shows that phishing was the most popular attack vector in 2021, resulting in one in five employees falling victim to phishing hacking techniques.  The Need for Security Awareness Training   Although technical solutions protect against phishing threats, no solution is 100% effective . Consequently, companies have no choice but to involve their employees in the fight against hackers. This is where security awareness training comes into play.   Security awareness training gives companies the confidence  that their employees will execute the right response when they discover a phishing message in their inbox.  As the saying goes, "knowledge is power," but the effectiveness of knowledge depends heavily on how it is delivered. When it comes to phishing attacks, simulations are among the most effective forms of training because the events in training simulations directly mimic how an employee would react in the event of an actu

Cisco Business Routers Found Vulnerable to Critical Remote Hacking Flaws<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/cisco-business-routers-found-vulnerable.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco on Wednesday rolled out patches to address eight security vulnerabilities , three of which could be weaponized by an unauthenticated attacker to gain remote code execution (RCE) or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on affected devices.  The most critical of the flaws impact Cisco Small Business RV160, RV260, RV340, and RV345 Series routers. Tracked as CVE-2022-20842 (CVSS score: 9.8), the weakness stems from an insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface of the appliances.   "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device," Cisco said  in an advisory. "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition."  A second shortcoming relates to a command injection vulnerability residing in the routers' web filter database update featur

Single-Core CPU Cracked Post-Quantum Encryption Candidate Algorithm in Just an Hour<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/single-core-cpu-cracked-post-quantum.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A late-stage candidate encryption algorithm that was meant to withstand decryption by powerful quantum computers in the future has been trivially cracked by using a computer running Intel Xeon CPU in an hour's time.  The algorithm in question is SIKE — short for Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation — which made it to the  fourth round  of the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process by the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  "Ran on a single core, the appended  Magma   code  breaks the Microsoft  SIKE challenges  $IKEp182 and $IKEp217 in about 4 minutes and 6 minutes, respectively," KU Leuven researchers Wouter Castryck and Thomas Decru  said  in a new paper.  "A run on the SIKEp434 parameters, previously believed to meet NIST's quantum security level 1, took about 62 minutes, again on a single core."   The code was executed on an Intel  Xeon CPU E5-2630v2  at 2.60GHz, which was release

Threat actors are increasingly mimicking legitimate applications like Skype, Adobe Reader, and VLC Player as a means to abuse trust relationships and increase the likelihood of a successful social engineering attack.  Other most impersonated legitimate apps by icon include 7-Zip, TeamViewer, CCleaner, Microsoft Edge, Steam, Zoom, and WhatsApp, an analysis from VirusTotal has revealed.  "One of the simplest social engineering tricks we've seen involves making a malware sample seem a legitimate program," VirusTotal  said  in a Tuesday report. "The icon of these programs is a critical feature used to convince victims that these programs are legitimate."  It's no surprise that threat actors resort to a variety of approaches to compromise endpoints by tricking unwitting users into downloading and running seemingly innocuous executables.   This, in turn, is primarily achieved by taking advantage of genuine domains in a bid to get around IP-based firewall defenses

The only threat more persistent to organizations than cyber criminals? The cyber security skills crisis.   Nearly  60% of enterprises  can't find the staff to protect their data (and reputations!) from new and emerging breeds of cyber-attacks, reports the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) in its 5th annual global industry study.   The result?  Heavier workloads, unfilled positions, and burnout.   And technology  isn't  easing the burden in many organizations, especially smaller ones. In fact, it's making the problem worse, suggests  Cynet's recent CISO survey .  Big Tech Pushes Small Teams to the Limits  Tech stacks normally supercharge cyber security teams, but in the case of crews of five or fewer — it just leads to overwhelm. For example, it took them an average of 18 months to fully implement and feel proficient in endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools — making the technology yet another barrier to cyber security for the  85% of teams adopting it in 2022 .   Su

Researchers Warns of Large-Scale AiTM Attacks Targeting Enterprise Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/researchers-warns-of-large-scale-aitm.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new, large-scale phishing campaign has been observed using adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) techniques to get around security protections and compromise enterprise email accounts.  "It uses an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attack technique capable of bypassing multi-factor authentication," Zscaler researchers Sudeep Singh and Jagadeeswar Ramanukolanu  said  in a Tuesday report. "The campaign is specifically designed to reach end users in enterprises that use Microsoft's email services."  Prominent targets include fintech, lending, insurance, energy, manufacturing, and federal credit union verticals located in the U.S., U.K., New Zealand, and Australia.   This is not the first time such a phishing attack has come to light. Last month, Microsoft  disclosed  that over 10,000 organizations had been targeted since September 2021 by means of AitM techniques to breach accounts secured with multi-factor authentication (MFA).  The ongoing campaign, effective June 2022,

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Virtualization services provider VMware on Tuesday shipped updates to  address 10 security flaws  affecting multiple products that could be abused by unauthenticated attackers to perform malicious actions.  The issues, tracked from CVE-2022-31656 through CVE-2022-31665 (CVSS scores: 4.7 - 9.8), impact VMware Workspace ONE Access, Workspace ONE Access Connector, Identity Manager, Identity Manager Connector, vRealize Automation, Cloud Foundation, and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager.   The most severe of the flaws is CVE-2022-31656 (CVSS score: 9.8), an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting local domain users that could be leveraged by a bad actor with network access to obtain administrative rights.  Also resolved by VMware are three remote code execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-31658, CVE-2022-31659, and CVE-2022-31665) related to JDBC and SQL injection that could be weaponized by an adversary with administrator and network access.

Researchers have disclosed a new offensive framework called Manjusaka that they call a "Chinese sibling of Sliver and Cobalt Strike."  "A fully functional version of the command-and-control (C2), written in GoLang with a User Interface in Simplified Chinese, is freely available and can generate new implants with custom configurations with ease, increasing the likelihood of wider adoption of this framework by malicious actors," Cisco Talos  said  in a new report.  Sliver  and  Cobalt Strike  are legitimate adversary emulation frameworks that have been used by threat actors to carry out post-exploitation activities such as network reconnaissance, lateral movement, and facilitating the deployment of follow-on payloads.  Written in Rust, Manjusaka -- meaning "cow flower" -- is advertised as an equivalent to the Cobalt Strike framework with capabilities to target both Windows and Linux operating systems. Its developer is believed to be located in the GuangDong

New 'ParseThru' Parameter Smuggling Vulnerability Affects Golang-based Applications<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/new-parsethru-parameter-smuggling.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have discovered a new vulnerability called  ParseThru  affecting Golang-based applications that could be abused to gain unauthorized access to cloud-based applications.  "The newly discovered vulnerability allows a threat actor to bypass validations under certain conditions, as a result of the use of unsafe URL parsing methods built in the language," Israeli cybersecurity firm Oxeye said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.  The issue, at its core, has to do with inconsistencies stemming from changes introduced to Golang's URL parsing logic that's implemented in the "net/url" library.   While versions of the programming language prior to 1.17 treated semicolons as a valid query delimiter (e.g., example.com?a=1;b=2&c=3), this behavior has since been modified to throw an error upon finding a query string containing a semicolon.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ransomware is a kind of malware used by cybercriminals to stop users from accessing their systems or files; the cybercriminals then threaten to leak, destroy or withhold sensitive information unless a ransom is paid.  Ransomware attacks can target either the data held on computer systems (known as locker ransomware) or devices (crypto-ransomware). In both instances, once a ransom is paid, threat actors typically provide victims with a decryption key or tool to unlock their data or device, though this is not guaranteed.  Oliver Pinson-Roxburgh, CEO of  Defense.com , the all-in-one cybersecurity platform, shares knowledge and advice in this article on how ransomware works, how damaging it can be, and how your business can mitigate ransomware attacks from occurring.  What does a ransomware attack comprise?

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor associated with the LockBit 3.0  ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation has been observed abusing the Windows Defender command-line tool to decrypt and load Cobalt Strike payloads.   According to a report published by SentinelOne last week, the incident occurred after obtaining initial access via the  Log4Shell vulnerability  against an unpatched VMware Horizon Server.  "Once initial access had been achieved, the threat actors performed a series of enumeration commands and attempted to run multiple post-exploitation tools, including Meterpreter, PowerShell Empire, and a new way to side-load Cobalt Strike," researchers Julio Dantas, James Haughom, and Julien Reisdorffer  said .   LockBit 3.0 (aka LockBit Black), which comes with the tagline "Make Ransomware Great Again!," is the  next iteration  of the prolific  LockBit RaaS family  that emerged in June 2022 to iron out  critical weaknesses  discovered in its predecessor.

Researchers have uncovered a list of 3,207 apps, some of which can be utilized to gain unauthorized access to Twitter accounts.  The takeover is made possible, thanks to a leak of legitimate Consumer Key and Consumer Secret information, respectively, Singapore-based cybersecurity firm CloudSEK said in a report  exclusively shared with The Hacker News.  "Out of 3,207, 230 apps are leaking all four authentication credentials and can be used to fully take over their Twitter Accounts and can perform any critical/sensitive actions," the researchers said.    This can range from reading direct messages to carrying out arbitrary actions such as retweeting, liking and deleting tweets, following any account, removing followers, accessing account settings, and even changing the account profile picture.  Access to the Twitter API  requires  generating the Keys and Access Tokens, which act as the usernames and passwords for the apps as well as the users on whose behalf the API requests w

Now more than ever, organizations need to enable their development teams to build and grow their security skills. Today organizations face a threat landscape where individuals, well-financed syndicates, and state actors are actively trying to exploit errors in software. Yet, according to recent global research, 67% of developers that were interviewed said they were still shipping code they knew contained vulnerabilities.   Helping your development teams progress to achieve security maturity is possible, and ultimately beneficial. It will help ensure secure software development at every stage of the software development lifecycle.  But how can you help your development teams reach security maturity?  We dug deep and leveraged insights from over 400 of our customers to identify traits and behaviors that occur when a development team increases its security maturity.
