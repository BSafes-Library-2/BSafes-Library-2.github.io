  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A cloud threat actor group tracked as 8220 has updated its malware toolset to breach Linux servers with the goal of installing crypto miners as part of a long-running campaign.  "The updates include the deployment of new versions of a crypto miner and an IRC bot," Microsoft Security Intelligence said  in a series of tweets on Thursday. "The group has actively updated its techniques and payloads over the last year."  8220, active since early 2017 , is a Chinese-speaking, Monero-mining threat actor so named for its preference to communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers over port 8220. It's also the developer of a tool called whatMiner, which has been co-opted by the Rocke  cybercrime group in their attacks.   In July 2019, the Alibaba Cloud Security Team uncovered  an extra shift in the adversary's tactics, noting its use of rootkits to hide the mining program. Two years later, the gang resurfaced  with Tsunami IRC botnet  variants and a custom "

Google Blocks Dozens of Malicious Domains Operated by Hack-for-Hire Groups<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/google-blocks-dozens-of-malicious.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) on Thursday disclosed it had acted to block as many as 36 malicious domains operated by hack-for-hire groups from India, Russia, and the U.A.E.  In a manner analogous to the  surveillanceware ecosystem , hack-for-hire firms equip their clients with capabilities to enable targeted attacks aimed at corporates as well as activists, journalists, politicians, and other high-risk users.  Where the two stand apart is that while customers purchase the spyware from commercial vendors and then deploy it themselves, the operators behind hack-for-hire attacks are known to conduct the intrusions on their clients' behalf in order to obscure their role.  "The hack-for-hire landscape is fluid, both in how the attackers organize themselves and in the wide range of targets they pursue in a single campaign at the behest of disparate clients," Shane Huntley, director of Google TAG,  said  in a report.

U.S. FCC Commissioner Asks Apple and Google to Remove TikTok from App Stores<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/us-fcc-commissioner-asks-apple-and.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
One of the commissioners of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has renewed calls asking for Apple and Google to boot the popular video-sharing platform TikTok from their app stores citing "its pattern of surreptitious data practices."  "It is clear that TikTok poses an unacceptable national security risk  due to its extensive data harvesting being combined with Beijing's apparently unchecked access to that sensitive data," Brendan Carr, a Republican member of the FCC,  wrote  in a letter to Apple and Google's chief executives.  TikTok, in September 2021,  disclosed  that there are one billion people who use its app every month, making it one of the largest social media platforms after Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, and WeChat.   Carr further emphasized that the short-form video service is far from just an app for sharing funny videos or memes, calling out its features as "sheep's clothing" intended to mask its core funct

Shadow IT refers to the practice of users deploying unauthorized technology resources in order to circumvent their IT department. Users may resort to using shadow IT practices when they feel that existing IT policies are too restrictive or get in the way of them being able to do their jobs effectively.  An old school phenomenon   Shadow IT is not new. There have been countless examples of widespread shadow IT use over the years. In the early 2000s, for example, many organizations were reluctant to adopt Wi-Fi for fear that it could undermine their security efforts. However, users wanted the convenience of wireless device usage and often deployed wireless access points without the IT department's knowledge or consent.  The same thing happened when the iPad first became popular. IT departments largely prohibited iPads from being used with business data because of the inability to apply group policy settings and other security controls to the devices. Even so, users often ignored IT and

A former Canadian government employee this week agreed to plead guilty in the U.S. to charges related to his involvement with the NetWalker ransomware syndicate.  Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins , who was  extradited to the U.S.  on March 10, 2022, is accused of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and wire fraud, intentional damage to a protected computer, and transmitting a demand in relation to damaging a protected computer.  The 34-year-old IT consultant from Gatineau, Quebec, was initially apprehended in January 2021 following a coordinated  law enforcement operation  to dismantle the dark web infrastructure used by the NetWalker ransomware cybercrime group to publish data siphoned from its victims. The takedown also brought its activities to a standstill.  A search warrant executed at Vachon-Desjardins's home in Canada resulted in the seizure of 719 bitcoin, valued at approximately $28.1 million at the time, and $790,000 in Canadian currency.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious North Korea-backed hacking collective Lazarus Group is suspected to be behind the recent $100 million altcoin theft from Harmony Horizon Bridge, citing similarities to the  Ronin bridge attack  in March 2022.  The finding comes as Harmony  confirmed  that its Horizon Bridge, a  platform  that allows users to move cryptocurrency across different blockchains, had been breached last week.  The incident involved the exploiter carrying out multiple transactions on June 23 that extracted tokens stored in the bridge and subsequently made away with about $100 million in cryptocurrency.  "The stolen crypto assets included Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and BNB," blockchain analytics company Elliptic  said  in a new report. "The thief immediately used Uniswap – a decentralized exchange (DEX) – to convert much of these assets into a total of 85,837 ETH."   Days later, on June 27, the culprit is said to have begun moving funds amounting to $39

New YTStealer Malware Aims to Hijack Accounts of YouTube Content Creators<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/new-ytstealer-malware-aims-to-hijack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have documented a new information-stealing malware that targets YouTube content creators by plundering their authentication cookies.  Dubbed "YTStealer" by Intezer, the malicious tool is likely believed to be sold as a service on the dark web, with it distributed using fake installers that also drop RedLine Stealer and Vidar.  "What sets YTStealer aside from other stealers sold on the dark web market is that it is solely focused on harvesting credentials for one single service instead of grabbing everything it can get ahold of," security researcher Joakim Kenndy said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.  The malware's modus operandi, however, mirrors its counterparts in that it extracts the cookie information from the web browser's database files in the user's profile folder. The reasoning given behind targeting content creators is that it uses one of the installed browsers on the infected machine to gather YouTube channel

New UnRAR Vulnerability Could Let Attackers Hack Zimbra Webmail Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/new-unrar-vulnerability-could-let.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new security vulnerability has been disclosed in RARlab's UnRAR utility that, if successfully exploited, could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a system that relies on the binary.  The flaw, assigned the identifier CVE-2022-30333, relates to a path traversal vulnerability in the Unix versions of UnRAR that can be triggered upon extracting a maliciously crafted RAR archive.  Following responsible disclosure on May 4, 2022, the shortcoming was addressed by RarLab as part of  version 6.12  released on May 6. Other versions of the software, including those for Windows and Android operating systems, are not impacted.   "An attacker is able to create files outside of the target extraction directory when an application or victim user extracts an untrusted archive," SonarSource researcher Simon Scannell  said  in a Tuesday report. "If they can write to a known location, they are likely to be able to leverage it in a way leading to the execution of arb

CISA Warns of Active Exploitation of 'PwnKit' Linux Vulnerability in the Wild<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/cisa-warns-of-active-exploitation-of.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) this week moved to  add  a Linux vulnerability dubbed  PwnKit  to its  Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog , citing evidence of active exploitation.  The issue, tracked as  CVE-2021-4034  (CVSS score: 7.8), came to light in January 2022 and concerns a case of  local privilege escalation  in polkit's pkexec utility, which allows an authorized user to execute commands as another user.   Polkit (formerly called PolicyKit) is a toolkit for controlling system-wide privileges in Unix-like operating systems, and provides a mechanism for non-privileged processes to communicate with privileged processes.  Successful exploitation of the flaw could induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code, granting an unprivileged attacker administrative rights on the target machine and compromising the host.  It's not immediately clear how the vulnerability is being weaponized in the wild, nor is there any information on the identity of

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A never-before-seen remote access trojan dubbed ZuoRAT  has been singling out small office/home office (SOHO) routers as part of a sophisticated campaign targeting North American and European networks.  The malware "grants the actor the ability to pivot into the local network and gain access to additional systems on the LAN by hijacking network communications to maintain an undetected foothold," researchers from Lumen Black Lotus Labs said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The stealthy operation, which targeted routers from ASUS, Cisco, DrayTek, and NETGEAR, is believed to have commenced in early 2020 during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, effectively remaining under the radar for over two years.  "Consumers and remote employees routinely use SOHO routers, but these devices are rarely monitored or patched, which makes them one of the weakest points of a network's perimeter," the company's threat intelligence team said.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Entities located in Afghanistan, Malaysia, and Pakistan are in the crosshairs of an attack campaign that targets unpatched Microsoft Exchange Servers as an initial access vector to deploy the ShadowPad malware.  Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which first detected the activity in mid-October 2021,  attributed  it to a previously unknown Chinese-speaking threat actor. Targets include organizations in the telecommunications, manufacturing, and transport sectors.   "During the initial attacks, the group exploited an MS Exchange vulnerability to deploy ShadowPad malware and infiltrated  building automation systems  of one of the victims," the company said. "By taking control over those systems, the attacker can reach other, even more sensitive systems of the attacked organization."  ShadowPad , which emerged in 2015 as the successor to PlugX, is a privately sold modular malware platform that has been put to use by many Chinese espionage actors over the years.   W

Your smartphone is your daily companion. The chances are that most of our activities rely on them, from ordering food to booking medical appointments. However, the threat landscape always reminds us how vulnerable smartphones can be.   Consider the recent  discovery by Oversecured , a security startup. These experts observed the dynamic code loading and its potential dangers. Why is this a problem? Well, the Google app uses code that does not come integrated with the app itself. Okay, this might sound confusing, but it all works in favor of optimizing certain processes. Thus, Google exploits code libraries pre-installed on Android phones to reduce their download size. In fact, many Android apps use this trick to optimize the storage space needed to run.   As revealed by Oversecured, perpetrators could compromise this retrieval of code from libraries. Instead of Google obtaining code from a reliable source, it could be tricked into taking code from malicious apps operating on the devic

OpenSSL to Release Security Patch for Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/openssh-to-release-security-patch-for.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The latest version of the OpenSSL library has been discovered as susceptible to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability on select systems.  The issue has been identified in OpenSSL  version 3.0.4 , which was released on June 21, 2022, and impacts x64 systems with the  AVX-512  instruction set. OpenSSL 1.1.1 as well as OpenSSL forks BoringSSL and LibreSSL are not affected.   Security researcher Guido Vranken, who reported the bug at the end of May,  said  it "can be triggered trivially by an attacker." Although the shortcoming has been  fixed , no patches have been made available as yet.  OpenSSL is a popular cryptography library that offers an open source implementation of the Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) protocol. Advanced Vector Extensions ( AVX ) are extensions to the x86 instruction set architecture for microprocessors from Intel and AMD.  "I do not think this is a security vulnerability," Tomáš Mráz of the OpenSSL Foundation said in a GitHub issue thread.

A previously unknown Android banking trojan has been discovered in the wild, targeting users of the Spanish financial services company BBVA.  Said to be in its early stages of development, the malware — dubbed  Revive  by Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy — was first observed on June 15, 2022 and distributed by means of phishing campaigns.  "The name Revive has been chosen since one of the functionality of the malware (called by the [threat actors] precisely 'revive') is restarting in case the malware stops working, Cleafy researchers Federico Valentini and Francesco Iubatti  said  in a Monday write-up.   Available for download from rogue phishing pages ("bbva.appsecureguide[.]com" or "bbva.european2fa[.]com") as a lure to trick users into downloading the app, the malware impersonates the bank's two-factor authentication (2FA) app and is said to be inspired from open-source spyware called  Teardroid , with the authors tweaking the original source c

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Black Basta ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) syndicate has amassed nearly 50 victims in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand within two months of its emergence in the wild, making it a prominent threat in a short window.  "Black Basta has been observed targeting a range of industries, including manufacturing, construction, transportation, telcos, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, plumbing and heating, automobile dealers, undergarments manufacturers, and more," Cybereason  said  in a report.  Similar to other ransomware operations, Black Basta is known to employ the tried-and-tested tactic of double extortion to plunder sensitive information from the targets and threaten to publish the stolen data unless a digital payment is made.  A new entrant in the already crowded ransomware landscape, intrusions involving the threat have  leveraged QBot  (aka  Qakbot ) as a conduit to maintain persistence on the compromised hosts and harvest credentials, before moving later

CODESYS has released patches to address as many as 11 security flaws that, if successfully exploited, could result in information disclosure and a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, among others.   "These vulnerabilities are simple to exploit, and they can be successfully exploited to cause consequences such as sensitive information leakage, PLCs entering a severe fault state, and arbitrary code execution," Chinese cybersecurity firm NSFOCUS  said . "In combination with industrial scenarios on the field, these vulnerabilities could expose industrial production to stagnation, equipment damage, etc."   CODESYS is a  software   suite  used by automation specialists as a development environment for programmable logic controller applications ( PLCs ).  Following responsible disclosure between September 2021 and January 2022, fixes were  shipped  by the German software company last week on June 23, 2022.

Just before last Christmas, in a first-of-a-kind case, JPMorgan was fined $200M for employees using non-sanctioned applications for communicating about financial strategy. No mention of insider trading, naked shorting, or any malevolence. Just employees circumventing regulation using, well, Shadow IT. Not because they tried to obfuscate or hide anything, simply because it was a convenient tool that they preferred over any other sanctioned products (which JPMorgan certainly has quite a few of.)   Visibility into unknown and unsanctioned applications has been required by regulators and also recommended by the Center for Internet Security community for a long time. Yet it seems like new and better approaches are still in demand. Gartner has identified External Attack Surface Management, Digital Supply Chain Risk, and Identity Threat Detection as the top three trends to focus on in 2022, all of which are closely intertwined with Shadow IT.

The Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali, in a press release  published  last week, called out a local web publisher for using the widely used analytics tool in a manner that allowed key bits of users' personal data to be illegally transferred to the U.S. without necessary safeguards.  This includes interactions of users with the websites, the individual pages visited, IP addresses of the devices used to access the websites, browser specifics, details related to the device's operating system, screen resolution, and the selected language, as well as the date and time of the visits.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malware-as-a-service (Maas) dubbed  Matanbuchus  has been observed spreading through phishing campaigns, ultimately dropping the Cobalt Strike post-exploitation framework on compromised machines.  Matanbuchus, like other  malware loaders  such as  BazarLoader ,  Bumblebee , and  Colibri , is engineered to download and execute second-stage executables from command-and-control (C&C) servers on infected systems without detection.  Available on Russian-speaking cybercrime forums for a price of $2,500 since February 2021, the malware is equipped with capabilities to launch .EXE and .DLL files in memory and run arbitrary PowerShell commands.   The findings, released by threat intelligence firm Cyble last week, document the latest infection chain associated with the loader, which is linked to a threat actor who goes by the online moniker BelialDemon.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected ransomware intrusion against an unnamed target leveraged a Mitel VoIP appliance as an entry point to achieve remote code execution and gain initial access to the environment.  The  findings  come from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which traced the source of the attack to a Linux-based Mitel VoIP device sitting on the network perimeter, while also identifying a previously unknown exploit as well as a couple of anti-forensic measures adopted by the actor on the device to erase traces of their actions.  The exploit in question is tracked as  CVE-2022-29499  and was fixed by Mitel in April 2022. It's rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system, making it a critical shortcoming.   "A vulnerability has been identified in the Mitel Service Appliance component of MiVoice Connect (Mitel Service Appliances – SA 100, SA 400, and Virtual SA) which could allow a malicious actor to perform remote code execution (CVE-2022-29499) within the context

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A week after it emerged that a sophisticated mobile spyware dubbed Hermit was used by the government of Kazakhstan within its borders, Google said it has notified Android users of infected devices.  Additionally, necessary changes have been implemented in  Google Play Protect  — Android's built-in malware defense service — to protect all users, Benoit Sevens and Clement Lecigne of Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG)  said  in a Thursday report.  Hermit, the work of an Italian vendor named RCS Lab, was  documented  by Lookout last week, calling out its modular feature-set and its abilities to harvest sensitive information such as call logs, contacts, photos, precise location, and SMS messages.  Once the threat has thoroughly insinuated itself into a device, it's also equipped to record audio and make and redirect phone calls, in addition to abusing its permissions to accessibility services to keep tabs on the foreground apps used by the victims.  Its modularity also enables it t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have discovered a number of malicious Python packages in the official third-party software repository that are engineered to exfiltrate AWS credentials and environment variables to a publicly exposed endpoint.  The list of packages includes loglib-modules, pyg-modules, pygrata, pygrata-utils, and hkg-sol-utils, according to Sonatype security researcher Ax Sharma. The packages and as well as the endpoint have now been taken down.  "Some of these packages either contain code that reads and exfiltrates your secrets or use one of the dependencies that will do the job," Sharma  said .   The malicious code injected into "loglib-modules" and "pygrata-utils" allow it to harvest AWS credentials, network interface information, and environment variables and export them to a remote endpoint: "hxxp://graph.pygrata[.]com:8000/upload."

A China-based advanced persistent threat (APT) group is possibly deploying short-lived ransomware families as a decoy to cover up the true operational and tactical objectives behind its campaigns.  The activity cluster, attributed to a hacking group dubbed  Bronze Starlight  by Secureworks, involves the deployment of post-intrusion ransomware such as LockFile, Atom Silo, Rook, Night Sky, Pandora, and LockBit 2.0.  "The ransomware could distract incident responders from identifying the threat actors' true intent and reduce the likelihood of attributing the malicious activity to a government-sponsored Chinese threat group," the researchers  said  in a new report. "In each case, the ransomware targets a small number of victims over a relatively brief period of time before it ceases operations, apparently permanently."  Bronze Starlight, active since mid-2021, is also tracked by Microsoft under the emerging threat cluster moniker DEV-0401, with the tech giant empha

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), along with the Coast Guard Cyber Command (CGCYBER), on Thursday released a joint advisory warning of continued attempts on the part of threat actors to exploit the Log4Shell flaw in VMware Horizon servers to breach target networks.  "Since December 2021, multiple threat actor groups have exploited Log4Shell on unpatched, public-facing VMware Horizon and [Unified Access Gateway] servers," the agencies  said . "As part of this exploitation, suspected APT actors implanted loader malware on compromised systems with embedded executables enabling remote command-and-control (C2)."  In one instance, the adversary is said to have been able to move laterally inside the victim network, obtain access to a disaster recovery network, and collect and exfiltrate sensitive law enforcement data.   Log4Shell , tracked as  CVE-2021-44228  (CVSS score: 10.0), is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting the Apache

The beleaguered Israeli surveillanceware vendor NSO Group this week admitted to the European Union lawmakers that its Pegasus tool was used by at least five countries in the region.  "We're trying to do the right thing and that's more than other companies working in the industry," Chaim Gelfand, the company's general counsel and chief compliance officer, said, according to a  report  from Politico.  Acknowledging that it had "made mistakes," the company also stressed on the need for an international standard to regulate the government use of spyware.   The disclosure comes as a special inquiry committee was  launched in April 2022  to investigate alleged breaches of E.U. law following revelations that the company's Pegasus spyware is being used to snoop on phones belonging to politicians, diplomats, and civil society members.  "The committee is going to look into existing national laws regulating surveillance, and whether Pegasus spyware was us

Manual vs. SSPM: Research on What Streamlines SaaS Security Detection & Remediation<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/manual-vs-sspm-research-on-what.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
When it comes to keeping SaaS stacks secure, IT and security teams need to be able to streamline the detection and remediation of misconfigurations in order to best protect their SaaS stack from threats. However, while companies adopt more and more apps, their increase in SaaS security tools and staff has lagged behind, as found in the  2022 SaaS Security Survey Report.   The survey report, completed by Adaptive Shield in conjunction with Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), dives into how CISOs today are managing the growing SaaS app attack surface and the steps they are taking to secure their organizations.   The report finds that at least 43% of organizations have experienced a security incident as a result of a SaaS misconfiguration; however, with another 20% being "unsure," the real number could be  as high as 63% . These numbers are particularly striking when compared to the 17% of organizations experiencing security incidents due to an IaaS misconfiguration.   Bearing this

Chinese Hackers Distributing SMS Bomber Tool with Malware Hidden Inside<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/chinese-hackers-distributing-sms-bomber.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat cluster with ties to a hacking group called Tropic Trooper  has been spotted using a previously undocumented malware coded in Nim language to strike targets as part of a newly discovered campaign.  The novel loader, dubbed Nimbda, is "bundled with a Chinese language greyware 'SMS Bomber' tool that is most likely illegally distributed in the Chinese-speaking web," Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point  said  in a report.  "Whoever crafted the Nim loader took special care to give it the same executable icon as the SMS Bomber that it drops and executes," the researchers said. "Therefore the entire bundle works as a trojanized binary."  SMS Bomber, as the name indicates, allows a user to input a phone number (not their own) so as to flood the victim's device with messages and potentially render it unusable in what's a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.   The fact that the binary doubles up as SMS Bomber and a backdoor suggests that t

QNAP, Taiwanese maker of network-attached storage (NAS) devices, on Wednesday said it's in the process of fixing a critical three-year-old PHP vulnerability that could be abused to achieve remote code execution.  "A vulnerability has been reported to affect PHP versions 7.1.x below 7.1.33, 7.2.x below 7.2.24, and 7.3.x below 7.3.11 with improper nginx config," the hardware vendor  said  in an advisory. "If exploited, the vulnerability allows attackers to gain remote code execution."   The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2019-11043 , is rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system. That said, it's required that Nginx and php-fpm are running in appliances using the following QNAP operating system versions -   QTS 5.0.x and later  QTS 4.5.x and later  QuTS hero h5.0.x and later  QuTS hero h4.5.x and later  QuTScloud c5.0.x and later   "As QTS, QuTS hero or QuTScloud does not have nginx installed by default, QNAP NAS are not aff

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new piece of research from academics at ETH Zurich has identified a number of critical security issues in the MEGA cloud storage service that could be leveraged to break the confidentiality and integrity of user data.  In a paper titled " MEGA: Malleable Encryption Goes Awry ," the researchers point out how MEGA's system does not protect its users against a malicious server, thereby enabling a rogue actor to fully compromise the privacy of the uploaded files.  "Additionally, the integrity of user data is damaged to the extent that an attacker can insert malicious files of their choice which pass all authenticity checks of the client," ETH Zurich's Matilda Backendal, Miro Haller, and Kenneth G. Paterson said in an analysis of the service's cryptographic architecture.  MEGA, which  advertises  itself as the "privacy company" and claims to provide user-controlled end-to-end encrypted cloud storage, has more than 10 million daily active users, w

Russian Hackers Exploiting Microsoft Follina Vulnerability Against Ukraine<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/russian-hackers-exploiting-microsoft.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has  cautioned  of a new set of spear-phishing attacks exploiting the "Follina" flaw in the Windows operating system to deploy password-stealing malware.  Attributing the intrusions to a Russian nation-state group tracked as APT28 (aka Fancy Bear or Sofacy), the agency said the attacks commence with a lure document titled "Nuclear Terrorism A Very Real Threat.rtf" that, when opened, exploits the recently disclosed vulnerability to download and execute a malware called CredoMap.  Follina ( CVE-2022-30190 , CVSS score: 7.8), which concerns a case of remote code execution affecting the Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), was addressed by Microsoft on June 14, 2022, as part of its  Patch Tuesday updates .   According to an independent report published by Malwarebytes,  CredoMap  is a variant of the .NET-based credential stealer that Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG)  divulged  last month as having been depl

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly discovered Magecart skimming campaign has its roots in a previous attack activity going all the way back to November 2021.  To that end, it has come to light that  two   malware  domains identified as hosting credit card skimmer code — "scanalytic[.]org" and "js.staticounter[.]net" — are part of a broader infrastructure used to carry out the intrusions, Malwarebytes said in a Tuesday analysis.  "We were able to connect these two domains with a  previous campaign from November 2021  which was the first instance to our knowledge of a skimmer checking for the use of virtual machines," Jérôme Segura  said . "However, both of them are now devoid of VM detection code. It's unclear why the threat actors removed it, unless perhaps it caused more issues than benefits."   The earliest evidence of the campaign's activity, based on the additional domains uncovered, suggests it dates back to at least May 2020.  Magecart  refers to a cybercrim

The suspects are men between the ages of 25 and 36 from Amsterdam, Almere, Rotterdam, and Spijkenisse and a 25-year-old woman from Deventer, according to a  statement  from the National Police Force.   Also confiscated as part of 24 house searches were firearms, ammunition, jewelry, designer clothing, expensive watches, electronic devices, tens of thousands of euros in cash, and cryptocurrency, the officials said.  "The criminal group contacted victims by email, text message and through mobile messaging applications," the agency  noted .

RIG Exploit Kit Now Infects Victims' PCs With Dridex Instead of Raccoon Stealer<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/rig-exploit-kit-now-infects-victims-pcs.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind the Rig Exploit Kit have swapped the Raccoon Stealer malware for the Dridex financial trojan as part of an ongoing campaign that commenced in January 2022.  The switch in modus operandi,  spotted  by Romanian company Bitdefender, comes in the wake of Raccoon Stealer  temporarily closing the project  after one of its team members responsible for critical operations passed away in the Russo-Ukrainian war in March 2022.  The Rig Exploit Kit is notable for its abuse of browser exploits to distribute an array of malware. First spotted in 2019, Raccoon Stealer is a credential-stealing trojan that's advertised and sold on underground forums as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) for $200 a month.   That said, the Raccoon Stealer actors are already working on a second version that's expected to be "rewritten from scratch and optimized." But the void left by the malware's exit is being filled by other information stealers such as RedLine Stealer and Vidar.

An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor codenamed ToddyCat  has been linked to a string of attacks aimed at high-profile entities in Europe and Asia since at least December 2020.  The relatively new adversarial collective is said to have commenced its operations by targeting Microsoft Exchange servers in Taiwan and Vietnam using an unknown exploit to deploy the China Chopper web shell and activate a multi-stage infection chain.  Other prominent countries targeted include Afghanistan, India, Indonesia, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Russia, Slovakia, Thailand, the U.K., and Uzbekistan, just as the threat actor evolved its toolset over the course of different campaigns.  "The first wave of attacks exclusively targeted Microsoft Exchange Servers, which were compromised with Samurai, a sophisticated passive backdoor that usually works on ports 80 and 443," Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky  said  in a report published today.

Nearly five dozen security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in devices from 10 operational technology (OT) vendors due to what researchers call are "insecure-by-design practices."  Collectively dubbed  OT:ICEFALL  by Forescout, the 56 issues span as many as 26 device models from Bently Nevada, Emerson, Honeywell, JTEKT, Motorola, Omron, Phoenix Contact, Siemens, and Yokogawa.  "Exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers with network access to a target device could remotely execute code, change the logic, files or firmware of OT devices, bypass authentication, compromise credentials, cause denials of service or have a variety of operational impacts," the company said in a technical report.  These vulnerabilities could have disastrous consequences considering the impacted products are widely employed in critical infrastructure industries such as oil and gas, chemical, nuclear, power generation and distribution, manufacturing, water treatment and distribution, min

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ransomware has been a thorn in the side of cybersecurity teams for years. With the move to remote and hybrid work, this insidious threat has become even more of a challenge for  organizations everywhere.  2021 was a case study in ransomware due to the wide variety of attacks, significant financial and economic impact, and diverse ways that organizations responded.  These attacks  should be seen as a lesson that can inform future security strategies to mitigate ransomware risk. As an organization continues to evolve, so should its security strategy.  The Remote Environment Is Primed for Ransomware  With organizations continuing to support remote and hybrid work, they no longer have the visibility and control they once had inside their perimeter. Attackers are  exploiting this weakness  and profiting. Here are three reasons they're able to do so:  Visibility and control have changed.  Most organizations now have employees working from anywhere. These employees expect seamless access to

A 36-year-old former Amazon employee was convicted of wire fraud and computer intrusions in the U.S. for her role in the theft of personal data of no fewer than 100 million people in the  2019 Capital One breach .  Paige Thompson , who operated under the online alias "erratic" and worked for the tech giant till 2016, was found guilty of wire fraud, five counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer, and damaging a protected computer.  The seven-day trial saw the jury acquitted her of other charges, including access device fraud and aggravated identity theft. She is scheduled for sentencing on September 15, 2022. Cumulatively, the offenses are punishable by up to 25 years in prison.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new kind of Windows NTLM relay attack dubbed  DFSCoerce  has been uncovered that leverages the Distributed File System (DFS): Namespace Management Protocol (MS-DFSNM) to seize control of a domain.  "Spooler service disabled, RPC filters installed to prevent PetitPotam and File Server VSS Agent Service not installed but you still want to relay [Domain Controller authentication to [Active Directory Certificate Services]? Don't worry MS-DFSNM have (sic) your back," security researcher Filip Dragovic  said  in a tweet.   MS-DFSNM  provides a remote procedure call (RPC) interface for administering distributed file system configurations.  The NTLM (NT Lan Manager) relay attack is a well-known method that exploits the challenge-response mechanism. It allows malicious parties to sit between clients and servers and intercept and relay validated authentication requests in order to gain unauthorized access to network resources, effectively gaining an initial foothold in Active Di

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Insurance exists to protect the insured party against catastrophe, but the insurer needs protection so that its policies are not abused – and that's where the fine print comes in. However, in the case of ransomware insurance, the fine print is becoming contentious and arguably undermining the usefulness of ransomware insurance.  In this article, we'll outline why, particularly given the current climate, war exclusion clauses are increasingly rendering ransomware insurance of reduced value – and why your organization should focus on protecting itself instead.  What is ransomware insurance  In recent years, ransomware insurance has grown as a product field because organizations are trying to buy protection against the catastrophic effects of a successful ransomware attack. Why try to buy insurance? Well, a single, successful attack can just about wipe out a large organization, or lead to crippling costs –  NotPetya alone led to a total of $10bn in damages .   Ransomware attacks

Google Researchers Detail 5-Year-Old Apple Safari Vulnerability Exploited in the Wild<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/google-researchers-detail-5-year-old.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security flaw in Apple Safari that was exploited in the wild earlier this year was originally fixed in 2013 and reintroduced in December 2016, according to a new report from Google Project Zero.  The issue, tracked as  CVE-2022-22620  (CVSS score: 8.8), concerns a case of a use-after-free vulnerability in the WebKit component that could be exploited by a piece of specially crafted web content to gain arbitrary code execution.  In early February 2022, Apple shipped patches for the bug across Safari, iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, while acknowledging that it "may have been actively exploited."   "In this case, the variant was completely patched when the vulnerability was initially reported in 2013," Maddie Stone of Google Project Zero  said . "However, the variant was reintroduced three years later during large refactoring efforts. The vulnerability then continued to exist for 5 years until it was fixed as an in-the-wild zero-day in January 2022."  While both th

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind  BRATA  have once again added more capabilities to the Android mobile malware in an attempt to make their attacks against financial apps more stealthy.  "In fact, the modus operandi now fits into an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) activity pattern," Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy  said  in a report last week. "This term is used to describe an attack campaign in which criminals establish a long-term presence on a targeted network to steal sensitive information."   An acronym for "Brazilian Remote Access Tool Android," BRATA was first  detected  in the wild in Brazil in late 2018, before making its first appearance in Europe last April, while masquerading as antivirus software and other common productivity tools to trick users into downloading them.  The change in the attack pattern, which scaled new highs in early April 2022, involves tailoring the malware to strike a specific financial institution at a time, switching to a differe

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details about 15 security flaws in Siemens SINEC network management system (NMS), some of which could be chained by an attacker to achieve remote code execution on affected systems.  "The vulnerabilities, if exploited, pose a number of risks to Siemens devices on the network including denial-of-service attacks, credential leaks, and remote code execution in certain circumstances," industrial security company Claroty  said  in a new report.   The shortcomings in question — tracked from CVE-2021-33722 through CVE-2021-33736 — were addressed by Siemens in version V1.0 SP2 Update 1 as part of updates shipped on October 12, 2021.  "The most severe could allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, with system privileges, under certain conditions," Siemens  noted  in an advisory at the time.   Chief among the weaknesses is CVE-2021-33723 (CVSS score: 8.8), which allows for privilege escalation to

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Thursday disclosed that it took down the infrastructure associated with a Russian botnet known as RSOCKS in collaboration with law enforcement partners in Germany, the Netherlands, and the U.K.  The botnet, operated by a sophisticated cybercrime organization, is believed to have ensnared millions of internet-connected devices, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Android phones, and computers for use as a proxy service.  Botnets, a constantly evolving threat, are networks of hijacked computer devices that are under the control of a single attacking party and are used to facilitate a variety of large-scale cyber intrusions such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, email spam, and cryptojacking.   "The RSOCKS botnet offered its clients access to IP addresses assigned to devices that had been hacked," the DoJ  said  in a press release. "The owners of these devices did not give the RSOCKS operator(s) authority to ac

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recently patched  critical security flaw  in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center products is being actively weaponized in real-world attacks to drop cryptocurrency miners and ransomware payloads.  In at least two of the Windows-related incidents observed by cybersecurity vendor Sophos, adversaries exploited the vulnerability to deliver Cerber ransomware and a  crypto miner  called z0miner on victim networks.  The bug ( CVE-2022-26134 , CVSS score: 9.8), which was  patched  by Atlassian on June 3, 2022, enables an unauthenticated actor to inject malicious code that paves the way of remote code execution (RCE) on affected installations of the collaboration suite. All supported versions of Confluence Server and Data Center are affected.   Other notable malware pushed as part of disparate instances of attack activity include Mirai and Kinsing bot variants, a rogue package called  pwnkit , and Cobalt Strike by way of a web shell deployed after gaining an initial foothold into the

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An enterprise-grade surveillanceware dubbed Hermit  has been put to use by entities operating from within Kazakhstan, Syria, and Italy over the years since 2019, new research has revealed.  Lookout attributed the spy software, which is equipped to target both Android and iOS, to an Italian company named RCS Lab S.p.A and Tykelab Srl, a telecom services provider which it suspects to be a front company. The San Francisco-based cybersecurity firm said it detected the campaign aimed at Kazakhstan in April 2022.  Hermit is modular and comes with myriad capabilities that allow it to "exploit a rooted device, record audio and make and redirect phone calls, as well as collect data such as call logs, contacts, photos, device location and SMS messages," Lookout researchers Justin Albrecht and Paul Shunk  said  in a new write-up.

It was first the pandemic that changed the usual state of work - before, it was commuting, working in the office & coming home for most corporate employees. Then, when we had to adapt to the self-isolation rules, the work moved to home offices, which completely changed the workflow for many businesses. As the pandemic went down, we realized success never relied on where the work was done. Whether your office is your kitchen, your bedroom, a nearby cafe, or your actual workplace in an office building, it all comes down to the fact that job success has nothing to do with your location.   The role of the office in the hybrid era is also changing - according to the research conducted by  PwC , it now serves the purpose of collaborating with team members and building relationships. From an employee's side, it sounds pretty logical and obvious.   However, if we look at hybrid work with the eyes of an employer, things get complicated. How does one make sure corporate devices & da

A sophisticated Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) actor exploited a critical security vulnerability in Sophos' firewall product that came to light earlier this year to infiltrate an unnamed South Asian target as part of a highly-targeted attack.  "The attacker implement[ed] an interesting web shell backdoor, create[d] a secondary form of persistence, and ultimately launch[ed] attacks against the customer's staff," Volexity  said  in a report. "These attacks aimed to further breach cloud-hosted web servers hosting the organization's public-facing websites."  The zero-day flaw in question is tracked as  CVE-2022-1040  (CVSS score: 9.8), and concerns an authentication bypass vulnerability that can be weaponized to execute arbitrary code remotely. It affects Sophos Firewall versions 18.5 MR3 (18.5.3) and earlier.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WordPress websites using a widely used plugin named Ninja Forms have been updated automatically to remediate a critical security vulnerability that's suspected of having been actively exploited in the wild.  The issue, which relates to a case of code injection, is rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity and affects multiple versions starting from 3.0.

According to Wordfence, the bug "made it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call a limited number of methods in various Ninja Forms classes, including a method that unserialized user-supplied content, resulting in Object Injection."   "This could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or delete arbitrary files on sites where a separate [property oriented programming] chain was present," Chloe Chamberland of Wordfence  noted .

Microsoft is warning that the BlackCat ransomware crew is leveraging exploits for  unpatched Exchange server  vulnerabilities to gain access to targeted networks.  Upon gaining an entry point, the attackers swiftly moved to gather information about the compromised machines, followed by carrying out credential theft and lateral movement activities, before harvesting intellectual property and dropping the ransomware payload.  The entire sequence of events played out over the course of two full weeks, the Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team  said  in a report published this week.  "In another incident we observed, we found that a ransomware affiliate gained initial access to the environment via an internet-facing Remote Desktop server using compromised credentials to sign in," the researchers said, pointing out how "no two BlackCat 'lives' or deployments might look the same."

A Microsoft Office 365 Feature Could Help Ransomware Hackers Hold Cloud Files Hostage<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/a-microsoft-office-365-feature-could.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A "dangerous piece of functionality" has been discovered in Microsoft 365 suite that could be potentially abused by a malicious actor to ransom files stored on SharePoint and OneDrive and launch attacks on cloud infrastructure.  The cloud ransomware attack makes it possible to launch file-encrypting malware to "encrypt files stored on SharePoint and OneDrive in a way that makes them unrecoverable without dedicated backups or a decryption key from the attacker," Proofpoint  said  in a report published today.  The infection sequence can be carried out using a combination of Microsoft APIs, command-line interface (CLI) scripts, and PowerShell scripts, the enterprise security firm added. The attack, at its core, hinges on a Microsoft 365 feature called AutoSave  that creates copies of older file versions as and when users make edits to a file stored on OneDrive or SharePoint Online.   It commences with gaining unauthorized access to a target user's SharePoint Onlin

Difference Between Agent-Based and Network-Based Internal Vulnerability Scanning<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/difference-between-agent-based-and.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For years, the two most popular methods for internal scanning: agent-based and network-based were considered to be about equal in value, each bringing its own strengths to bear. However, with remote working now the norm in most if not all workplaces, it feels a lot more like agent-based scanning is a must, while network-based scanning is an optional extra.  This article will go in-depth on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, but let's wind it back a second for those who aren't sure why they should even do internal scanning in the first place.  Why should you perform internal vulnerability scanning?  While  external vulnerability scanning  can give a great overview of what you look like to a hacker, the information that can be gleaned without access to your systems can be limited. Some serious vulnerabilities can be discovered at this stage, so it's a must for many organizations, but that's not where hackers stop.   Techniques like phishing, targeted malware,

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a recently patched high-severity security vulnerability in the popular Fastjson library  that could be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-25845  (CVSS score: 8.1), the  issue  relates to a case of  deserialization of untrusted data  in a supported feature called "AutoType." It was patched by the project maintainers in  version 1.2.83  released on May 23, 2022.   "This vulnerability affects all Java applications that rely on Fastjson versions 1.2.80 or earlier and that pass user-controlled data to either the JSON.parse or JSON.parseObject APIs without specifying a specific  class  to deserialize," JFrog's Uriya Yavnieli  said  in a write-up.  Fastjson  is a Java library that's used to convert Java Objects into their  JSON  representation and vice versa.  AutoType , the function vulnerable to the flaw, is enabled by default and is designed to specify a custom type when parsing

MaliBot: A New Android Banking Trojan Spotted in the Wild<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/malibot-new-android-banking-trojan.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new strain of Android malware has been spotted in the wild targeting online banking and cryptocurrency wallet customers in Spain and Italy, just weeks after a coordinated law enforcement operation dismantled  FluBot .  The information stealing trojan, codenamed  MaliBot  by F5 Labs, is as feature-rich as its  counterparts , allowing it to steal credentials and cookies, bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes, and abuse Android's Accessibility Service to monitor the victim's device screen.  MaliBot is known to primarily disguise itself as cryptocurrency mining apps such as Mining X or The CryptoApp that are distributed via fraudulent websites designed to attract potential visitors into downloading them.   It also takes another leaf out of the mobile banking trojan playbook in that it employs smishing as a distribution vector to proliferate the malware by accessing an infected smartphone's contacts and sending SMS messages containing links to the malware.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco on Wednesday rolled out fixes to address a critical security flaw affecting Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Secure Email and Web Manager that could be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to sidestep authentication.  Assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-20798 , the bypass vulnerability is rated 9.8 out of a maximum of 10 on the CVSS scoring system and stems from improper authentication checks when an affected device uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ( LDAP ) for external authentication.   "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering a specific input on the login page of the affected device," Cisco noted in an advisory. "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the web-based management interface of the affected device."  The flaw, which it said was identified during the resolution of a technical assistance center (TAC) case, impacts ESA and Secure Email and Web Manager running vulnerable

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Golang-based peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet has been spotted actively targeting Linux servers in the education sector since its emergence in March 2022.  Dubbed  Panchan  by Akamai Security Research, the malware "utilizes its built-in concurrency features to maximize spreadability and execute malware modules" and "harvests SSH keys to perform lateral movement."   The feature-packed botnet, which relies on a basic list of default SSH passwords to carry out a  dictionary attack  and expand its reach, primarily functions as a cryptojacker designed to hijack a computer's resources to mine cryptocurrencies.  The cybersecurity and cloud service company noted it first spotted Panchan's activity on March 19, 2022, and attributed the malware to a likely Japanese threat actor based on the language used in the administrative panel baked into the binary to edit the mining configuration.  Panchan is known to deploy and execute two miners, XMRig and nbhash, on the host

New Hertzbleed Side-Channel Attack Affects All Modern AMD and Intel CPUs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/new-hertzbleed-side-channel-attack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly discovered security vulnerability in modern Intel and AMD processors could let remote attackers steal encryption keys via a power side channel attack.  Dubbed  Hertzbleed  by a group of researchers from the University of Texas, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Washington, the issue is rooted in dynamic voltage and frequency scaling ( DVFS ), power and thermal management feature employed to conserve power and reduce the amount of heat generated by a chip.  "The cause is that, under certain circumstances, periodic CPU frequency adjustments depend on the current CPU power consumption, and these adjustments directly translate to execution time differences (as 1 hertz = 1 cycle per second)," the researchers said.    This can have significant security implications on cryptographic libraries even when implemented correctly as  constant-time code  to prevent timing-based side channels, effectively enabling an attacker to leverage the execution t

Breaches don't just happen to large enterprises. Threat actors are increasingly targeting small businesses. In fact,  43%  of data breaches involved small to medium-sized businesses.

Most small businesses ( 83% ), however, don't have the financial resources to recover if they are a victim of an attack.   These small security teams were getting lost in the shuffle...until now.   The rise of XDR   As the threat landscape changes and bad actors continue to evolve their tactics, the industry is responding with new solutions and approaches to the way we do cybersecurity.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloudflare on Tuesday disclosed that it had acted to prevent a record-setting 26 million request per second (RPS) distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack last week, making it the largest HTTPS DDoS attack detected to date.  The web performance and security company said the attack was directed against an unnamed customer website using its Free plan and emanated from a "powerful" botnet of 5,067 devices, with each node generating approximately 5,200 RPS at peak.  The botnet is said to have created a flood of more than 212 million HTTPS requests within less than 30 seconds from over 1,500 networks in 121 countries, including Indonesia, the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India. Roughly 3% of the attack came through Tor nodes.   The attack "originated mostly from Cloud Service Providers as opposed to Residential Internet Service Providers, indicating the use of hijacked virtual machines and powerful servers to generate the attack — as opposed to much weaker Internet of Things

Microsoft officially released fixes to address an actively exploited Windows zero-day vulnerability known as Follina as part of its Patch Tuesday updates.  Also addressed by the tech giant are  55 other flaws , three of which are rated Critical, 51 are rated Important, and one is rated Moderate in severity. Separately,  five other shortcomings  were resolved in the Microsoft Edge browser.   Tracked as  CVE-2022-30190  (CVSS score: 7.8), the  zero-day bug  relates to a remote code execution vulnerability affecting the Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) when it's invoked using the "ms-msdt:" URI protocol scheme from an application such as Word.  The vulnerability can be trivially exploited by means of a specially crafted Word document that downloads and loads a malicious HTML file through Word's remote template feature. The HTML file ultimately permits the attacker to load and execute PowerShell code within Windows.  "An attacker who successfully exploits this

New Zimbra Email Vulnerability Could Let Attackers Steal Your Login Credentials<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/new-zimbra-email-vulnerability-could.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new high-severity vulnerability has been disclosed in the Zimbra email suite that, if successfully exploited, enables an unauthenticated attacker to steal cleartext passwords of users sans any user interaction.  "With the consequent access to the victims' mailboxes, attackers can potentially escalate their access to targeted organizations and gain access to various internal services and steal highly sensitive information," SonarSource  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-27924  (CVSS score: 7.5), the issue has been characterized as a case of "Memcached poisoning with unauthenticated request," leading to a scenario where an adversary can inject malicious commands and siphon sensitive information.   This is made possible by poisoning the  IMAP  route cache entries in the Memcached server that's used to look up Zimbra users and forward their HTTP requests to appropriate backend services.   Given that Memcached parses incoming

In 2017, The Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC) published a set of mitigation strategies that were designed to help organizations to protect themselves against cyber security incidents. These strategies, which became known as  the Essential Eight , are designed specifically for use on Windows networks, although variations of these strategies are commonly applied to other platforms.  What is the Essential Eight?   The Essential Eight is essentially a cyber security framework that is made up of objectives and controls (with each objective including multiple controls). Initially, the Australian government only mandated that companies adhere to four of the security controls that were included in the first objective. Starting in June of 2022 however, all 98 non-corporate Commonwealth entities (NCCEs) are going to be  required to comply with the entire framework .  Non-Australians take note   Although the Essential Eight is specific to Australia, organizations outside of Australia shou

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has incorporated additional improvements to address the recently disclosed  SynLapse  security vulnerability in order to meet comprehensive  tenant isolation   requirements  in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Pipelines.  The latest safeguards include moving the shared integration runtimes to sandboxed ephemeral instances and using scoped tokens to prevent adversaries from using a client certificate to access other tenants' information.  "This means that if an attacker could execute code on the  integration runtime , it is never shared between two different tenants, so no sensitive data is in danger," Orca Security said in a technical report  detailing the flaw.   The high-severity issue, tracked as  CVE-2022-29972  (CVSS score: 7.8) and disclosed early last month, could have allowed an attacker to perform remote command execution and gain access to another Azure client's cloud environment.

Unpatched Travis CI API Bug Exposes Thousands of Secret User Access Tokens<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/unpatched-travis-ci-api-bug-exposes.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unpatched security issue in the Travis CI API has left tens of thousands of developers' user tokens exposed to potential attacks, effectively allowing threat actors to breach cloud infrastructures, make unauthorized code changes, and initiate supply chain attacks.  "More than 770 million logs of free tier users are available, from which you can easily extract tokens, secrets, and other credentials associated with popular cloud service providers such as GitHub, AWS, and Docker Hub," researchers from cloud security firm Aqua  said  in a Monday report.  Travis CI is a  continuous integration  service used to build and test software projects hosted on cloud repository platforms such as GitHub and Bitbucket.   The issue, previously reported in 2015 and  2019 , is rooted in the fact that the  API  permits access to historical logs in cleartext format, enabling a malicious party to even "fetch the logs that were previously unavailable via the API."  The logs go all

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new covert Linux kernel rootkit named  Syslogk  has been spotted under development in the wild and cloaking a malicious payload that can be remotely commandeered by an adversary using a  magic network traffic packet .  "The Syslogk rootkit is heavily based on Adore-Ng but incorporates new functionalities making the user-mode application and the kernel rootkit hard to detect," Avast security researchers David Álvarez and Jan Neduchal  said  in a report published Monday.  Adore-Ng, an  open-source rootkit  available since 2004, equips the attacker with full control over a compromised system. It also facilitates hiding processes as well as custom malicious artifacts, files, and even the kernel module, making it harder to detect.   "The module starts by hooking itself into various file systems. It digs up the inode for the root filesystem, and replaces that inode's  readdir()  function pointer with one of its own," LWN.net  noted  at the time. "The Adore ver

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the workings of a fully-featured malware loader dubbed  PureCrypter  that's being purchased by cyber criminals to deliver remote access trojans (RATs) and information stealers.  "The loader is a .NET executable obfuscated with SmartAssembly and makes use of compression, encryption, and obfuscation to evade antivirus software products," Zscaler's Romain Dumont  said  in a new report.   Some of the malware families distributed using PureCrypter include  Agent Tesla ,  Arkei ,  AsyncRAT ,  AZORult ,  DarkCrystal RAT  (DCRat),  LokiBot ,  NanoCore ,  RedLine Stealer ,  Remcos ,  Snake Keylogger , and  Warzone RAT .   Sold for a price of $59 by its developer named "PureCoder" for a one-month plan (and $249 for a one-off lifetime purchase) since at least March 2021, PureCrypter is advertised as the "only crypter in the market that uses offline and online delivery technique."

A technically sophisticated threat actor known as  SeaFlower  has been targeting Android and iOS users as part of an extensive campaign that mimics official cryptocurrency wallet websites intending to distribute backdoored apps that drain victims' funds.  Said to be first discovered in March 2022, the cluster of activity "hint[s] to a strong relationship with a Chinese-speaking entity yet to be uncovered," based on the macOS usernames, source code comments in the backdoor code, and its abuse of Alibaba's Content Delivery Network (CDN).   "As of today, the main current objective of SeaFlower is to modify Web3 wallets with backdoor code that ultimately exfiltrates the seed phrase," Confiant's Taha Karim  said  in a technical deep-dive of the campaign.

A Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Gallium has been observed using a previously undocumented remote access trojan in its espionage attacks targeting companies operating in Southeast Asia, Europe, and Africa.  Called  PingPull , the "difficult-to-detect" backdoor is notable for its use of the Internet Control Message Protocol ( ICMP ) for command-and-control (C2) communications, according to new research published by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 today.   Gallium is known for its attacks primarily aimed at telecom companies dating as far back as 2012. Also tracked under the name  Soft Cell  by Cybereason, the state-sponsored actor has been  connected  to a broader set of attacks targeting five major telecom companies located in Southeast Asian countries since 2017.  Over the past year, however, the group is said to have expanded its victimology footprint to include financial institutions and government entities located in Afghanistan, Australia, Belgium, Cambodi

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of two medium-security flaws in Mitel 6800/6900 desk phones that, if successfully exploited, could allow an attacker to gain root privileges on the devices.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-29854  and  CVE-2022-29855  (CVSS score: 6.8), the access control issues were discovered by German penetration testing firm SySS, following which patches were shipped in May 2022.   "Due to this undocumented backdoor, an attacker with physical access to a vulnerable desk phone can gain root access by pressing specific keys on system boot, and then connect to a provided Telnet service as root user," SySS researcher Matthias Deeg said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.  Specifically, the issue relates to a previously unknown functionality present in a shell script ("check_mft.sh") in the phones' firmware that's designed to be executed at system boot.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
BPFDoor isn't new to the  cyberattack  game — in fact, it's gone undetected for years — but PwC researchers discovered the piece of malware in 2021. Subsequently, the cybersecurity community is learning more about the  stealthy nature of malware , how it works, and how it can be prevented.  What's BPFDoor?  BPFDoor  is a piece of malware associated with China-based threat actor Red Menshen that has hit mostly Linux operating systems. It's undetected by firewalls and goes unnoticed by most detection systems — so unnoticed that it's been a work in progress over the last five years, going through various phases of development and complexity.  How Does It Work?  BPF stands for Berkley Packet Filters, which is appropriate given that the virus exploits packet filters. BPFDoor uses BPF " sniffers " to see all network traffic and find vulnerabilities. Packet filters are programs that analyze "packets" (files, metadata, network traffic) and permit or dec

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Windows and Linux systems are being targeted by a ransomware variant called HelloXD, with the infections also involving the deployment of a backdoor to facilitate persistent remote access to infected hosts.  "Unlike other ransomware groups, this ransomware family doesn't have an active leak site; instead it prefers to direct the impacted victim to negotiations through  Tox chat  and onion-based messenger instances," Daniel Bunce and Doel Santos, security researchers from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42,  said  in a new write-up.  HelloXD  surfaced in the wild on November 30, 2021, and is based off leaked code from Babuk, which was  published  on a Russian-language cybercrime forum in September 2021.   The ransomware family is no exception to the norm in that the operators follow the tried-and-tested approach of  double extortion  to demand cryptocurrency payments by exfiltrating a victim's sensitive data in addition to encrypting it and threatening to publicize the inform

Iranian Hackers Spotted Using a new DNS Hijacking Malware in Recent Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/iranian-hackers-spotted-using-new-dns.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian state-sponsored threat actor tracked under the moniker Lyceum has turned to using a new custom .NET-based backdoor in recent campaigns directed against the Middle East.  "The new malware is a .NET based DNS Backdoor which is a customized version of the open source tool 'DIG.net,'" Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Niraj Shivtarkar and Avinash Kumar  said  in a report published last week.  "The malware leverages a DNS attack technique called 'DNS Hijacking' in which an attacker-controlled DNS server manipulates the response of DNS queries and resolves them as per their malicious requirements."   DNS hijacking is a  redirection attack  in which DNS queries to genuine websites are intercepted to take an unsuspecting user to fraudulent pages under an adversary's control. Unlike  cache poisoning , DNS hijacking targets the DNS record of the website on the nameserver, rather than a resolver's cache.   Lyceum , also known as Hexane, Spirli

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A novel hardware attack dubbed  PACMAN  has been demonstrated against Apple's M1 processor chipsets, potentially arming a malicious actor with the capability to gain arbitrary code execution on macOS systems.  It leverages "speculative execution attacks to bypass an important memory protection mechanism, ARM Pointer Authentication, a security feature that is used to enforce pointer integrity," MIT researchers Joseph Ravichandran, Weon Taek Na, Jay Lang, and Mengjia Yan  said  in a new paper. What's more concerning is that "while the hardware mechanisms used by PACMAN cannot be patched with software features, memory corruption bugs can be," the researchers added.  The vulnerability is rooted in pointer authentication codes ( PACs ), a line of defense introduced in arm64e architecture that aims to detect and secure against unexpected changes to  pointers  — objects that store a memory address — in memory.   PACs aim to solve a common problem in software secur

Researchers Find Bluetooth Signals Can be Fingerprinted to Track Smartphones<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/researchers-find-bluetooth-signals-can.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new research undertaken by a group of academics from the University of California San Diego has revealed for the first time that Bluetooth signals can be fingerprinted to track smartphones (and therefore, individuals).  The identification, at its core, hinges on imperfections in the Bluetooth chipset hardware introduced during the manufacturing process, resulting in a "unique physical-layer fingerprint."  "To perform a physical-layer fingerprinting attack, the attacker must be equipped with a Software Defined Radio sniffer: a radio receiver capable of recording raw IQ radio signals," the researchers  said  in a  new paper   titled  "Evaluating Physical-Layer BLE Location Tracking Attacks on Mobile Devices."   The  attack  is made possible due to the ubiquitous nature of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons that are continuously transmitted by modern devices to enable crucial functions such as  contact tracing  during public health emergencies.

Cybercriminals are impersonating popular crypto platforms such as Binance, Celo, and Trust Wallet with spoofed emails and fake login pages in an attempt to steal login details and deceptively transfer virtual funds.  "As cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) become more mainstream, and capture headlines for their volatility, there is a greater likelihood of more individuals falling victim to fraud attempting to exploit people for digital currencies," Proofpoint  said  in a new report.  "The rise and proliferation of cryptocurrency has also provided attackers with a new method of financial extraction."  The targeting of sensitive cryptocurrency data by threat actors was recently echoed by the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team, which warned about the emerging threat of  cryware  wherein private keys, seed phrases, and wallet addresses are plundered with the goal of siphoning virtual currencies by means of fraudulent transfers.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as eight zero-day vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Carrier's LenelS2 HID Mercury access control system that's used widely in healthcare, education, transportation, and government facilities.  "The vulnerabilities uncovered allowed us to demonstrate the ability to remotely unlock and lock doors, subvert alarms and undermine logging and notification systems," Trellix security researchers Steve Povolny and Sam Quinn said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The issues, in a nutshell, could be weaponized by a malicious actor to gain full system control, including the ability to manipulate door locks. One of the bugs (CVE-2022-31481) includes an unauthenticated remote execution flaw that's rated 10 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS scoring system.   Other shortcomings could lead to command injection (CVE-2022-31479, CVE-2022-31486), denial-of-service (CVE-2022-31480, CVE-2022-31482), user modification (CVE-2022-31484), and information spoofing (CVE

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly designed privacy-sensitive architecture aims to enable developers to create smart home apps in a manner that addresses data sharing concerns and puts users in control over their personal information.   Dubbed  Peekaboo  by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, the  system  "leverages an in-home hub to pre-process and minimize outgoing data in a structured and enforceable manner before sending it to external cloud servers."  Peekaboo operates on the principle of data minimization, which refers to the practice of limiting data collection to only what is required to fulfill a specific purpose.   To achieve this the system requires developers to explicitly declare the relevant data collection behaviors in the form of a manifest file that's then fed into an in-home trusted hub to transmit sensitive data from smart home apps such as smart doorbells on a need-to-know basis.  The hub not only functions as a mediator between raw data from IoT devices and the respec

The operators behind Symbiote are believed to have commenced development on the malware in November 2021, with the threat actor predominantly using it to target the financial sector in Latin America, including banks like Banco do Brasil and Caixa.  "Symbiote's main objective is to capture credentials and to facilitate backdoor access to a victim's machine," researchers Joakim Kennedy and Ismael Valenzuela said in a report  shared with The Hacker News. "What makes Symbiote different from other Linux malware is that it infects running processes rather than

Common cybercriminals are a menace, there's no doubt about it – from bedroom hackers through to ransomware groups, cybercriminals are causing a lot of damage. But both the tools used and the threat posed by common cybercriminals pale in comparison to the tools used by more professional groups such as the famous hacking groups and state-sponsored groups.  In fact, these tools can prove almost impossible to detect – and guard against. BVP47 is a case in point. In this article, we'll outline how this powerful state-sponsored malware has been quietly circulating for years, how it so cleverly disguises itself, and explain what that means for cybersecurity in the enterprise.  Background story behind BVP47  It's a long story, fit for a spy novel. Earlier this year, a Chinese cybersecurity research group called Pangu Lab published an in-depth, 56-page report covering a piece of malicious code that the research group decided to call BVP47 (because BVP was the most common string in

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Chinese-speaking advanced persistent threat (APT) actor dubbed  Aoqin Dragon  has been linked to a string of espionage-oriented attacks aimed at government, education, and telecom entities chiefly in Southeast Asia and Australia dating as far back as 2013.  "Aoqin Dragon seeks initial access primarily through document exploits and the use of fake removable devices," SentinelOne researcher Joey Chen  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Other techniques the attacker has been observed using include DLL hijacking,  Themida-packed files , and DNS tunneling to evade post-compromise detection."  The group is said to have some level of association with another threat actor known as  Naikon  (aka Override Panda), with campaigns primarily directed against targets in Australia, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam.   Infections chains mounted by Aoqin Dragon have banked on Asia-Pacific political affairs and pornographic-themed docu

Image Source: Toptal  The notorious Emotet malware has turned to deploy a new module designed to siphon credit card information stored in the Chrome web browser.  The credit card stealer, which exclusively singles out Chrome, has the ability to exfiltrate the collected information to different remote command-and-control (C2) servers, according to enterprise security company  Proofpoint , which observed the component on June 6.  The development comes amid a  spike  in  Emotet   activity  since it was resurrected late last year following a 10-month-long hiatus in the wake of a law enforcement operation that  took down its attack infrastructure  in January 2021.  Emotet, attributed to a threat actor known as TA542 (aka Mummy Spider or Gold Crestwood), is an advanced, self-propagating and modular trojan that's delivered via email campaigns and is used as a distributor for other payloads such as ransomware.   As of April 2022, Emotet is still the most popular malware with a global impac

Researchers Warn of Unpatched "DogWalk" Microsoft Windows Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/researchers-warn-of-unpatched-dogwalk.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unofficial security patch has been made available for a new Windows zero-day vulnerability in the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), even as the Follina flaw continues to be exploited in the wild.  The issue — referenced as  DogWalk  — relates to a path traversal flaw that can be exploited to stash a malicious executable file to the Windows Startup folder when a potential target opens a specially crafted ".diagcab" archive file that contains a diagnostics configuration file.  The idea is that the payload would get executed the next time the victim logs in to the system after a restart. The vulnerability affects all Windows versions, starting from Windows 7 and Server Server 2008 to the latest releases.   DogWalk was originally  disclosed  by security researcher Imre Rad in January 2020 after Microsoft, having acknowledged the problem, deemed it as not a security issue.  "There are a number of file types that can execute code in such a way but aren't techni

U.S. Agencies Warn About Chinese Hackers Targeting Telecoms and Network Service Providers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/us-agencies-warn-about-chinese-hackers.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have  warned  about China-based state-sponsored cyber actors leveraging network vulnerabilities to exploit public and private sector organizations since at least 2020.  The widespread intrusion campaigns aim to exploit publicly identified security flaws in network devices such as Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) routers and Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices with the goal of gaining deeper access to victim networks.  In addition, the actors used these compromised devices as route command-and-control (C2) traffic to break into other targets at scale, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  said  in a joint advisory.   The perpetrators, besides shifting their tactics in response to public disclosures, are known to employ a mix of open-source and custom tools for reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning as well as to obscure and ble

An illicit online marketplace known as SSNDOB  was taken down in operation led by U.S. law enforcement agencies, the Department of Justice (DoJ) announced Tuesday.  SSNDOB trafficked in personal information such as names, dates of birth, credit card numbers, and Social Security numbers of about 24 million individuals in the U.S., generating its operators $19 million in sales revenue.  The action saw the seizure of several domains associated with the marketplace — ssndob.ws, ssndob.vip, ssndob.club, and blackjob.biz — in cooperation with authorities from Cyprus and Latvia.  According to blockchain analytics firm  Chainalysis , SSNDOB's Bitcoin payment processing system has received nearly $22 million worth of Bitcoin across over 100,000 transactions since April 2015.   Furthermore, bitcoin transfers to the tune of more than $100,000 have been unearthed between SSNDOB and  Joker's Stash , another darknet market that specialized in stolen credit card information and voluntarily c

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat cluster dubbed UNC2165, which shares numerous overlaps with a Russia-based cybercrime group known as Evil Corp, has been linked to multiple LockBit ransomware intrusions in an attempt to get around  sanctions  imposed by the U.S. Treasury in December 2019.  "These actors have shifted away from using exclusive ransomware variants to LockBit — a well-known ransomware as a service (RaaS) — in their operations, likely to hinder attribution efforts in order to evade sanctions," threat intelligence firm Mandiant  noted  in an analysis last week.  Active since 2019, UNC2165 is known to obtain initial access to victim networks via stolen credentials and a JavaScript-based downloader malware called  FakeUpdates  (aka SocGholish), leveraging it to previously deploy  Hades  ransomware.   Hades is the work of a financially motivated hacking group named Evil Corp, which is also called by the monikers Gold Drake and Indrik Spider and has been attributed to the infamous  Dridex

Enforcing the "double-extortion" technique aka pay-now-or-get-breached emerged as a head-turner last year.   May 6th, 2022 is a recent example.  The State Department said the Conti strain of ransomware was the most costly in terms of payments made by victims as of January .  Conti, a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) program, is one of the most notorious ransomware groups and has been responsible for infecting hundreds of servers with malware to gain corporate data or digital damage systems, essentially spreading misery to individuals and hospitals, businesses, government agencies and more all over the world.  So, how different is a  ransomware attack  like Conti from the infamous "WannaCry" or "NotPetya"?  While other Ransomware variants can spread fast and encrypt files within short time frames, Conti ransomware has demonstrated unmatched speed by which it can access victims' systems.  Given the recent spate of data breaches, it is extremely challengin

Researchers Warn of Spam Campaign Targeting Victims with SVCReady Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/researchers-warn-of-spam-campaign.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new wave of phishing campaigns has been observed spreading a previously documented malware called SVCReady .  "The malware is notable for the unusual way it is delivered to target PCs — using shellcode hidden in the properties of Microsoft Office documents," Patrick Schläpfer, a threat analyst at HP,  said  in a technical write-up.  SVCReady is said to be in its early stage of development, with the authors iteratively updating the malware several times last month. First signs of activity date back to April 22, 2022.  Infection chains involve sending Microsoft Word document attachments to targets via email that contain VBA macros to activate the deployment of malicious payloads.   But where this campaign stands apart is that instead of employing PowerShell or MSHTA to retrieve next-stage executables from a remote server, the macro runs shellcode stored in the  document properties , which subsequently drops the SVCReady malware.  In addition to achieving persistence on the i

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple has introduced a Rapid Security Response feature  in iOS 16 and macOS Ventura that's designed to deploy security fixes without the need for a full operating system version update.  "macOS security gets even stronger with new tools that make the Mac more resistant to attack, including Rapid Security Response that works in between normal updates to easily keep security up to date without a reboot," the company  said  in a statement on Monday.  The feature, which also works on iOS , aims to separate regular software updates from critical security improvements and are applied automatically so that users are quickly protected against in-the-wild attacks  and unexpected threats. It's worth noting that Apple tested an analogous option  in iOS 14.5.   Rapid Security Response, viewed in that light, mirrors a similar approach taken by Google through Play Services  and Play Protect  to secure Android devices from malware and other kinds of fraud.

Unpatched Critical Flaws Disclosed in U-Boot Bootloader for Embedded Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/unpatched-critical-flaws-disclosed-in-u.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed  two unpatched security vulnerabilities  in the open-source U-Boot boot loader.  The issues, which were uncovered in the  IP defragmentation  algorithm implemented in U-Boot by NCC Group, could be abused to achieve arbitrary out-of-bounds write and denial-of-service (DoS).  U-Boot is a  boot loader  used in Linux-based embedded systems such as ChromeOS as well as ebook readers such as Amazon Kindle and Kobo eReader.   The issues are summarized below -   CVE-2022-30790  (CVSS score: 9.6) - Hole Descriptor overwrite in U-Boot IP packet defragmentation leads to an arbitrary out-of-bounds write primitive.  CVE-2022-30552  (CVSS score: 7.1) - Large buffer overflow leads to DoS in U-Boot IP packet defragmentation code   It's worth noting that both the flaws are exploitable only from the local network. But doing so can enable an attacker to root the devices and lead to a DoS by crafting a malformed packet.  The shortcomings are expected to be addr

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) last week disclosed that it had taken legal proceedings against an Iranian threat actor dubbed  Bohrium  in connection with a spear-phishing operation.  The adversarial collective is said to have targeted entities in tech, transportation, government, and education sectors located in the U.S., Middle East, and India.   "Bohrium actors create fake social media profiles, often posing as recruiters," Amy Hogan-Burney of the DCU  said  in a tweet. "Once personal information was obtained from the victims, Bohrium sent malicious emails with links that ultimately infected their target's computers with malware."  According to an  ex parte order  shared by the tech giant, the goal of the intrusions was to steal and exfiltrate sensitive information, take control over the infected machines, and carry out remote reconnaissance.  To halt the malicious activities of Bohrium, Microsoft said it took down 41 ".com," ".info

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
"Shifting (security)" left approach in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) means starting security earlier in the process. As organizations realized that software never comes out perfectly and are riddled with many exploitable holes, bugs, and business logic vulnerabilities that require going back to fix and patch, they understood that building secure software requires incorporating and consolidating numerous resources.  This conclusion led DevOps and R&D leaders to become proactive, acquiring technology to find and close these gaps in advance, with the aim of reducing the cost and effort while improving the quality of their outcomes.   With emerging comprehensive  continuous security validation technology , the demonstrated benefits of 'shifting left' as a fundamental part of SDLC can now be applied to your cybersecurity program, with results far exceeding the purely technical aspects of security posture management.   At the development level, the conceptuali

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have issued an advisory about critical security vulnerabilities in Illumina's next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) software.  Three of the flaws are rated 10 out of 10 for severity on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System ( CVSS ), with two others having severity ratings of 9.1 and 7.4.  The issues impact software in medical devices used for "clinical diagnostic use in sequencing a person's DNA or testing for various genetic conditions, or for research use only,"  according to the FDA .   "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an unauthenticated malicious actor to take control of the affected product remotely and take any action at the operating system level," CISA  said  in an alert.

A suspected state-aligned threat actor has been attributed to a new set of attacks exploiting the Microsoft Office "Follina" vulnerability to target government entities in Europe and the U.S.  Enterprise security firm Proofpoint said it blocked attempts at exploiting the remote code execution flaw, which is being tracked  CVE-2022-30190  (CVSS score: 7.8). No less than 1,000 phishing messages containing a lure document were sent to the targets.  "This campaign masqueraded as a salary increase and utilized an RTF with the exploit payload downloaded from 45.76.53[.]253," the company  said  in a series of tweets.   The payload, which manifests in the form of a PowerShell script, is Base64-encoded and functions as a downloader to retrieve a second PowerShell script from a remote server named "seller-notification[.]live."

Atlassian on Friday rolled out fixes to address a  critical security flaw  affecting its Confluence Server and Data Center products that have come under active exploitation by threat actors to achieve remote code execution.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-26134 , the issue is similar to  CVE-2021-26084  — another security flaw the Australian software company patched in August 2021.  Both relate to a case of Object-Graph Navigation Language ( OGNL ) injection that could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance.   The newly discovered shortcoming impacts all supported versions of Confluence Server and Data Center, with every version after 1.3.0 also affected. It's been resolved in the following versions -   7.4.17  7.13.7  7.14.3  7.15.2  7.16.4  7.17.4  7.18.1   According to stats from internet asset discovery platform  Censys , there are about 9,325 services across 8,347 distinct hosts running a vulnerable version of Atlassian Confluenc

GitLab has moved to address a critical security flaw in its service that, if successfully exploited, could result in an account takeover.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-1680 , the issue has a CVSS severity score of 9.9 and was discovered internally by the company. The security flaw affects all versions of GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE) starting from 11.10 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, and all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1.   "When group SAML SSO is configured, the SCIM feature (available only on Premium+ subscriptions) may allow any owner of a Premium group to invite arbitrary users through their username and email, then change those users' email addresses via SCIM to an attacker controlled email address and thus — in the absence of 2FA — take over those accounts," GitLab  said .

An "extremely sophisticated" Chinese-speaking advanced persistent threat (APT) actor dubbed  LuoYu  has been observed using a malicious Windows tool called WinDealer that's delivered by means of man-on-the-side attacks.  "This groundbreaking development allows the actor to modify network traffic in-transit to insert malicious payloads," Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky  said  in a new report. "Such attacks are especially dangerous and devastating because they do not require any interaction with the target to lead to a successful infection."  Known to be active since 2008, organizations targeted by LuoYu are predominantly foreign diplomatic organizations established in China and members of the academic community as well as financial, defense, logistics, and telecommunications companies.   LuoYu's use of  WinDealer  was first documented by Taiwanese cybersecurity firm  TeamT5  at the Japan Security Analyst Conference (JSAC) in January 2021. S

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Parrot traffic direction system (TDS) that came to light earlier this year has had a larger impact than previously thought, according to new research.  Sucuri, which has been tracking the same campaign since February 2019 under the name "NDSW/NDSX," said that "the malware was one of the top infections" detected in 2021, accounting for more than 61,000 websites.  Parrot TDS was  documented  in April 2022 by Czech cybersecurity company Avast, noting that the PHP script had ensnared web servers hosting more than 16,500 websites to act as a gateway for further attack campaigns.  This involves appending a piece of malicious code to all JavaScript files on compromised web servers hosting content management systems (CMS) such as WordPress that are in turn said to be breached by taking advantage of weak login credentials and vulnerable plugins.   Besides using different obfuscation tactics to conceal the code, the "injected JavaScript may also be found well indent

Microsoft on Thursday said it took steps to disable malicious activity stemming from abuse of OneDrive by a previously undocumented threat actor it tracks under the chemical element-themed moniker Polonium.  In addition to removing the offending accounts created by the Lebanon-based activity group, the tech giant's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said it suspended over 20 malicious OneDrive applications created and that it notified affected organizations.  "The observed activity was coordinated with other actors affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), based primarily on victim overlap and commonality of tools and techniques," MSTIC  assessed  with "moderate confidence."   The adversarial collective is believed to have breached more than 20 organizations based in Israel and one intergovernmental organization with operations in Lebanon since February 2022.  Targets of interest included entities in the manufacturing, IT, transpo

As the threat landscape evolves and multiplies with more advanced attacks than ever, defending against these modern cyber threats is a monumental challenge for almost any organization.   Threat detection is about an organization's ability to accurately identify threats, be it to the network, an endpoint, another asset or an application – including cloud infrastructure and assets. At scale, threat detection analyzes the entire security infrastructure to identify malicious activity that could compromise the ecosystem.  Countless solutions support threat detection, but the key is to have as much data as possible available to bolster your security visibility. If you don't know what is happening on your systems, threat detection is impossible.   Deploying the right security software is critical for protecting you from threats.  What do we mean by threat detection software?  In the early days of threat detection, software was deployed to protect against different forms of malware. However,

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of  leaked chats  from the notorious  Conti ransomware group  earlier this year has revealed that the syndicate has been working on a set of firmware attack techniques that could offer a path to accessing privileged code on compromised devices.  "Control over firmware gives attackers virtually unmatched powers both to directly cause damage and to enable other long-term strategic goals," firmware and hardware security firm Eclypsium  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "Such level of access would allow an adversary to cause irreparable damage to a system or to establish ongoing persistence that is virtually invisible to the operating system."   Specifically, this includes attacks aimed at embedded microcontrollers such as the Intel  Management Engine  ( ME ), a privileged component that's part of the company's processor chipsets and which can completely bypass the operating system.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As ransomware infections have evolved from purely encrypting data to schemes such as double and triple extortion, a new attack vector is likely to set the stage for future campaigns.  Called Ransomware for IoT or  R4IoT  by Forescout, it's a "novel, proof-of-concept ransomware that exploits an IoT device to gain access and move laterally in an IT [information technology] network and impact the OT [operational technology] network."  This potential pivot is based on the rapid growth in the number of IoT devices as well as the convergence of IT and OT networks in organizations.   The ultimate goal of R4IoT is to leverage exposed and vulnerable IoT devices such as IP cameras to gain an initial foothold, followed by deploying ransomware in the IT network and taking advantage of poor operational security practices to hold mission-critical processes hostage.  "By compromising IoT, IT, and OT assets, R4IoT goes beyond the usual encryption and data exfiltration to cause phys

New Unpatched Horde Webmail Bug Lets Hackers Take Over Server by Sending Email<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/new-unpatched-horde-webmail-bug-lets.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new unpatched security vulnerability has been disclosed in the open-source Horde Webmail client that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution on the email server simply by sending a specially crafted email to a victim.  "Once the email is viewed, the attacker can silently take over the complete mail server without any further user interaction," SonarSource said in a report  shared with The Hacker News. "The vulnerability exists in the default configuration and can be exploited with no knowledge of a targeted Horde instance."  The issue, which has been assigned the CVE identifier  CVE-2022-30287 , was reported to the vendor on February 2, 2022. The maintainers of the Horde Project did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the unresolved vulnerability.   At its core, the issue makes it possible for an authenticated user of a Horde instance to run malicious code on the underlying server by taking advantage of a quirk in how the client

An international law enforcement operation involving 11 countries has culminated in the takedown of a notorious mobile malware threat called  FluBot .  "This Android malware has been spreading aggressively through SMS, stealing passwords, online banking details and other sensitive information from infected smartphones across the world," Europol  said  in a statement.   The "complex investigation" included authorities from Australia, Belgium, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the U.S.  FluBot , also called Cabassous, emerged in the wild in December 2020, masking its insidious intent behind the veneer of seemingly innocuous package tracking applications such as FedEx, DHL, and Correos.   It primarily spreads via smishing (aka SMS-based phishing) messages that trick unsuspecting recipients into clicking on a link to download the malware-laced apps.   Once launched, the app would proceed to request access to Android

As many as 47,337 malicious plugins have been uncovered on 24,931 unique websites, out of which 3,685 plugins were sold on legitimate marketplaces, netting the attackers $41,500 in illegal revenues.  The findings come from a new tool called  YODA  that aims to detect rogue WordPress plugins and track down their origin, according to an 8-year-long study conducted by a group of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology.  "Attackers impersonated benign plugin authors and spread malware by distributing pirated plugins," the researchers  said  in a new paper titled " Mistrust Plugins You Must ."   "The number of malicious plugins on websites has steadily increased over the years, and malicious activity peaked in March 2020. Shockingly, 94% of the malicious plugins installed over those 8 years are still active today."

An enhanced version of the XLoader malware has been spotted adopting a probability-based approach to camouflage its command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure, according to the latest research.  "Now it is significantly harder to separate the wheat from the chaff and discover the real C&C servers among thousands of legitimate domains used by Xloader as a smokescreen," Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point  said .  First spotted in the wild in October 2020, XLoader is a successor to Formbook and a  cross-platform information stealer  that's capable of plundering credentials from web browsers, capturing keystrokes and screenshots, and executing arbitrary commands and payloads.   More recently, the  ongoing geopolitical conflict  between Russia and Ukraine has proved to be a lucrative fodder for  distributing XLoader  by means of  phishing emails  aimed at high-ranking government officials in Ukraine.
