In one way or another, almost every aspect of our lives is online, so it's no surprise that hackers target everything from email accounts to banks to smart home devices, looking for vulnerabilities to exploit. One of the easiest exploits is cracking a weak password. That's why using a strong, unique password for each individual account is so important. But creating and remembering strong, unique passwords for dozens of accounts is nearly impossible – unless you're using  a top-rated password manager like Keeper .  The Problem With Weak Passwords  Image via Keeper  A strong password  should  be a minimum of 12 characters long, with uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and one or more special characters.

Microsoft Links Raspberry Robin USB Worm to Russian Evil Corp Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/microsoft-links-raspberry-robin-usb.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Friday disclosed a potential connection between the Raspberry Robin USB-based worm and an infamous Russian cybercrime group tracked as Evil Corp.  The tech giant  said  it observed the  FakeUpdates  (aka SocGholish) malware being delivered via existing Raspberry Robin infections on July 26, 2022.  Raspberry Robin, also called QNAP Worm, is  known  to spread from a compromised system via infected USB devices containing malicious a .LNK files to other devices in the target network.   The campaign, which was first spotted by Red Canary in September 2021, has been elusive in that no later-stage activity has been documented nor has there any concrete link tying it to a known threat actor or group.  The disclosure, therefore, marks the first evidence of post-exploitation actions carried out by the threat actor upon leveraging the malware to gain initial access to a Windows machine.  "The DEV-0206-associated FakeUpdates activity on affected systems has since led to follow-o

North Korean Hackers Using Malicious Browser Extension to Spy on Email Accounts<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/north-korean-hackers-using-malicious.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor operating with interests aligned with North Korea has been deploying a malicious extension on Chromium-based web browsers that's capable of stealing email content from Gmail and AOL.  Cybersecurity firm Volexity attributed the malware to an activity cluster it calls  SharpTongue , which is said to share overlaps with an  adversarial collective  publicly referred to under the name  Kimsuky .  SharpTongue has a history of singling out individuals working for organizations in the U.S., Europe, and South Korea who "work on topics involving North Korea, nuclear issues, weapons systems, and other matters of strategic interest to North Korea," researchers Paul Rascagneres and Thomas Lancaster  said .  Kimsuky 's use of rogue extensions in attacks is not new. In 2018, the actor was seen utilizing a Chrome plugin as part of a campaign called  Stolen Pencil  to infect victims and steal browser cookies and passwords.   But the latest espionage effort is different

CISA Warns of Atlassian Confluence Hard-Coded Credential Bug Exploited in Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/cisa-warns-of-atlassian-confluence-hard.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday  added  the recently disclosed Atlassian security flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.  The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2022-26138 , concerns the use of hard-coded credentials when the Questions For Confluence app is enabled in Confluence Server and Data Center instances.   "A remote unauthenticated attacker can use these credentials to log into Confluence and access all content accessible to users in the confluence-users group," CISA  notes  in its advisory.   Depending on the page restrictions and the information a company has in Confluence, successful exploitation of the shortcoming could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.  Although the bug was addressed by the Atlassian software company last week in versions 2.7.38 and 3.0.5, it has since come under active exploitation , cybersecurity firm Rapid7 disclosed this week.   &quo

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious campaign leveraged seemingly innocuous Android dropper apps on the Google Play Store to compromise users' devices with  banking   malware .  These 17 dropper apps, collectively dubbed  DawDropper  by Trend Micro, masqueraded as productivity and utility apps such as document scanners, QR code readers, VPN services, and call recorders, among others. All these apps in question have been removed from the app marketplace.   "DawDropper uses Firebase Realtime Database, a third-party cloud service, to evade detection and dynamically obtain a payload download address," the researchers  said . "It also hosts malicious payloads on GitHub."   Droppers are apps designed to sneak past Google's Play Store security checks, following which they are used to download more potent and intrusive malware on a device, in this case,  Octo  (Coper),  Hydra ,  Ermac , and  TeaBot .  Attack chains involved the DawDropper malware establishing connections with a Firebase Re

Researchers Warns of Increase in Phishing Attacks Using Decentralized IPFS Network<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/researchers-warns-of-increase-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The decentralized file system solution known as IPFS is becoming the new "hotbed" for hosting phishing sites, researchers have warned.  Cybersecurity firm Trustwave SpiderLabs, which disclosed specifics of the attack campaigns, said it identified no less than 3,000 emails containing IPFS phishing URLs as an attack vector in the last three months.  IPFS , short for InterPlanetary File System, is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to store and share files and data using cryptographic hashes, instead of URLs or filenames, as is observed in a traditional client-server approach. Each hash forms the basis for a unique content identifier ( CID ).  The idea is to create a resilient distributed file system that allows data to be stored across multiple computers. This would allow information to be accessed without having to rely on third parties such as cloud storage providers, effectively making it resistant to censorship.   "Taking down phishing content stored on IPFS can be difficul

How to Combat the Biggest Security Risks Posed by Machine Identities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/how-to-combat-biggest-security-risks_29.html"> Full Text</a>

The rise of  DevOps culture  in enterprises has accelerated product delivery timelines. Automation undoubtedly has its advantages. However,  containerization and the rise of cloud software development  are exposing organizations to a sprawling new attack surface.  Machine identities vastly outnumber human ones in enterprises these days. Indeed, the rise of machine identities is creating cybersecurity debt, and increasing security risks.   Let's take a look at three of the top security risks which machine identities create – and how you can combat them.  Certificate renewal issues  Machine identities are secured differently from human ones. While human IDs can be verified with login and password credentials, machine IDs use certificates and keys. A huge issue with these types of credentials is they have expiration dates.   Generally, certificates remain valid for two years, but the rapid pace of technological improvement has reduced some lifespans to 13 months.

Spanish Police Arrest 2 Nuclear Power Workers for Cyberattacking the Radiation Alert System<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/spanish-police-arrest-2-nuclear-power.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Spanish law enforcement officials have announced the arrest of two individuals in connection with a cyberattack on the country's radioactivity alert network (RAR), which took place between March and June 2021.  The act of sabotage is said to have disabled more than one-third of the sensors that are maintained by the Directorate-General for Civil Protection and Emergencies ( DGPCE ) and used to monitor excessive radiation levels across the country.  The reason for the attacks is unknown as yet.   "The two detainees, former workers, attacked the computer system and caused the connection of the sensors to fail, reducing their detection capacity even in the environment of nuclear power plants," the Policía Nacional  said .  The law enforcement probe, dubbed Operation GAMMA, commenced in June 2021 in the aftermath of an attack perpetrated against the RAR network, which is a mesh of 800 gamma radiation detection sensors deployed in various parts of the country to detect surges

Latest Critical Atlassian Confluence Vulnerability Under Active Exploitation<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/latest-critical-atlassian-confluence.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A week after Atlassian rolled out patches to contain a critical flaw in its Questions For Confluence app for Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center, the shortcoming has now come under active exploitation in the wild.  The bug in question is  CVE-2022-26138 , which concerns the use of a hard-coded password in the app that could be exploited by a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain unrestricted access to all pages in Confluence.   The real-world exploitation follows the release of the hard-coded credentials on Twitter, prompting the Australian software company to prioritize patches to mitigate potential threats targeting the flaw.  "Unsurprisingly, it didn't take long [...] to observe exploitation once the hard-coded credentials were released, given the high value of Confluence for attackers who often jump on Confluence vulnerabilities to execute ransomware attacks," Rapid7 security researcher Glenn Thorpe  said .   It's worth noting that the bug only exists

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Wednesday said it's once again delaying its plans to turn off third-party cookies in the Chrome web browser from late 2023 to the second half of 2024.  "The most consistent feedback we've received is the need for more time to evaluate and test the new Privacy Sandbox technologies before deprecating third-party cookies in Chrome," Anthony Chavez, vice president of Privacy Sandbox,  said .  In keeping this in mind, the internet and ad tech giant said it's taking a "deliberate approach" and  extending the testing window  for its ongoing Privacy Sandbox initiatives prior to phasing out third-party cookies.  Cookies are pieces of data planted on a user's computer or other device by the web browser as a website is accessed, with third-party cookies  fueling much of the digital advertising ecosystem and its ability to track users across different sites to show targeted ads.  Privacy Sandbox is Google's umbrella term for a set of technologies

With Microsoft taking steps to block Excel 4.0 (XLM or XL4) and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros by default across Office apps, malicious actors are responding by refining their new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).  "The use of VBA and XL4 Macros decreased approximately 66% from October 2021 through June 2022," Proofpoint  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  In its place, adversaries are increasingly pivoting away from macro-enabled documents to other alternatives, including container files such as ISO and RAR as well as Windows Shortcut (LNK) files in campaigns to distribute malware.  "Threat actors pivoting away from directly distributing macro-based attachments in email represents a significant shift in the threat landscape," Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, said in a statement.

MSSPs must find ways to balance the need to please existing customers, add new ones, and deliver high-margin services against their internal budget constraints and the need to maintain high employee morale. In an environment where there are thousands of potential alerts each day and cyberattacks are growing rapidly in frequency and sophistication, this isn't an easy balance to maintain.  Customers want airtight security, but adding dozens of security tools to scan for and respond to any potential attack often means that specific analysts become experts in specific tools. It's left to the whole team to manually correlate their findings to discover and respond to multi-layered attacks, and hackers are always finding ways to exploit the gaps in coverage. This is a no-win situation where the analysts are frustrated, customers are dissatisfied, and costs can easily run out of control.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The team behind LibreOffice has released security updates to fix three security flaws in the productivity software, one of which could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on affected systems.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-26305 , the issue has been described as a case of improper certificate validation when checking whether a macro is signed by a trusted author, leading to the execution of rogue code packaged within the macros.   "An adversary could therefore create an arbitrary certificate with a serial number and an issuer string identical to a trusted certificate which LibreOffice would present as belonging to the trusted author, potentially leading to the user to execute arbitrary code contained in macros improperly trusted," LibreOffice said in an advisory.  Also resolved is the use of a static initialization vector ( IV ) during encryption ( CVE-2022-26306 ) that could have weakened the security should a bad actor have access to the user's configuration inform

The U.S. State Department has announced rewards of up to $10 million for any information that could help disrupt North Korea's cryptocurrency theft, cyber-espionage, and other illicit state-backed activities.  "If you have information on any individuals associated with the North Korean government-linked malicious cyber groups (such as Andariel, APT38, Bluenoroff, Guardians of Peace, Kimsuky, or Lazarus Group) and who are involved in targeting U.S. critical infrastructure in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, you may be eligible for a reward," the department  said  in a tweet.  The amount is double the bounty the agency  publicized  in March 2022 for specifics regarding the financial mechanisms employed by state-sponsored actors working on behalf of the North Korean government.   The development comes a week after the Justice Department  disclosed  the seizure of $500,000 worth of Bitcoin from North Korean hackers who extorted digital payments by using a new r

As many as 30 malicious Android apps with cumulative downloads of nearly 10 million have been found on the Google Play Store distributing adware.  "All of them were built into various programs, including image-editing software, virtual keyboards, system tools and utilities, calling apps, wallpaper collection apps, and others," Dr.Web  said  in a Tuesday write-up.  While masquerading as innocuous apps, their primary goal is to request permissions to show windows over other apps and run in the background in order to serve intrusive ads.  To make it difficult for the victims to detect and uninstall the apps, the adware trojans hide their icons from the list of installed apps in the home screen or replace the icons with others that are likely to be less noticed (e.g., SIM Toolkit).   Some of these apps also offer the advertised features, as observed in the case of two apps: "Water Reminder- Tracker & Reminder" and "Yoga- For Beginner to Advanced." However

Facebook business and advertising accounts are at the receiving end of an ongoing campaign dubbed  Ducktail  designed to seize control as part of a financially driven cybercriminal operation.   "The threat actor targets individuals and employees that may have access to a Facebook Business account with an information-stealer malware," Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure (formerly F-Secure Business)  said  in a new report.  "The malware is designed to steal browser cookies and take advantage of authenticated Facebook sessions to steal information from the victim's Facebook account and ultimately hijack any Facebook Business account that the victim has sufficient access to."  The attacks, attributed to a Vietnamese threat actor, are said to have begun in the latter half of 2021, with primary targets being individuals with managerial, digital marketing, digital media, and human resources roles in companies.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Software vulnerabilities are a major threat to organizations today. The cost of these threats is significant, both financially and in terms of reputation. Vulnerability management and patching can easily get out of hand when the number of vulnerabilities in your organization is in the hundreds of thousands of vulnerabilities and tracked in inefficient ways, such as using Excel spreadsheets or multiple reports, especially when many teams are involved in the organization. Even when a process for patching is in place, organizations still struggle to effectively patch vulnerabilities in their assets. This is generally because teams look at the severity of vulnerabilities and tend to apply patches to vulnerabilities in the following severity order: critical > high > medium > low > info. The following sections explain why this approach is flawed and how it can be improved.  Why is Patching Difficult?  While it is well known that vulnerability patching is extremely important, it

Malicious IIS Extensions Gaining Popularity Among Cyber Criminals for Persistent Access<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/malicious-iis-extensions-gaining.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are increasingly abusing Internet Information Services ( IIS ) extensions to backdoor servers as a means of establishing a "durable persistence mechanism."  That's according to a  new warning  from the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team, which said that "IIS backdoors are also harder to detect since they mostly reside in the same directories as legitimate modules used by target applications, and they follow the same code structure as clean modules."  Attack chains taking this approach commence with weaponizing a critical vulnerability in the hosted application for initial access, using this foothold to drop a script web shell as the first stage payload.   This web shell then becomes the conduit for installing a rogue IIS module to provide highly covert and persistent access to the server, in addition to monitoring incoming and outgoing requests as well as running remote commands.  Indeed, earlier this month, Kaspersky researchers disclosed a cam

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have reiterated similarities between the latest iteration of the LockBit ransomware and  BlackMatter , a rebranded variant of the DarkSide ransomware strain that closed shop in November 2021.  The new version of  LockBit , called LockBit 3.0 aka LockBit Black, was released in June 2022, launching a brand new leak site and what's the very first ransomware bug bounty program, alongside Zcash as a cryptocurrency payment option.  Its encryption process involves appending the extension "HLJkNskOq" or "19MqZqZ0s" to each and every file and changing the icons of the locked files to that of the .ico file that's dropped by the LockBit sample to kick-start the infection.  "The ransomware then drops its ransom note, which references 'Ilon Musk' and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)," Trend Micro researchers  said  in a Monday report.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The financial services industry has always been at the forefront of technology adoption, but the 2020 pandemic accelerated the widespread of mobile banking apps, chat-based customer service, and other digital tools.  Adobe's 2022 FIS Trends Report ,  for instance, found that more than half of the financial services and insurance firms surveyed experienced a notable increase in digital/mobile visitors in the first half of 2020. The same report found that four out of ten financial executives say that digital and mobile channels account for more than half of their sales – a trend that's only expected to continue in the next few years.  As financial institutions expand their digital footprint, they have more opportunities to better serve their customers – but are also more exposed to security threats. Every new tool increases the attack surface. A higher number of potential security gaps, may potentially lead to a higher number of security breaches.  According to the  Cisco CISO B

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as 207 websites have been infected with malicious code designed to launch a cryptocurrency miner by leveraging WebAssembly (Wasm) on the browser.  Web security company Sucuri, which published details of the campaign, said it launched an investigation after one of its clients had their computer slowed down significantly every time upon navigating to their own WordPress portal.  This uncovered a compromise of a theme file to inject malicious JavaScript code from a remote server -- hxxps://wm.bmwebm[.]org/auto.js -- that's loaded whenever the website's page is accessed.  "Once decoded, the contents of auto.js immediately reveal the functionality of a cryptominer which starts mining when a visitor lands on the compromised site," Sucuri malware researcher Cesar Anjos  said .  What's more, the deobfuscated auto.js code makes use of WebAssembly to run low-level binary code directly on the browser.   WebAssembly , which is supported by all major browsers, is a  b

Critical FileWave MDM Flaws Open Organization-Managed Devices to Remote Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/critical-filewave-mdm-flaws-open.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
FileWave's mobile device management (MDM) system has been found vulnerable to two critical security flaws that could be leveraged to carry out remote attacks and seize control of a fleet of devices connected to it.  "The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable and enable an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain full control over the MDM platform and its managed devices," Claroty security researcher Noam Moshe  said  in a Monday report.  FileWave MDM is a cross-platform mobile device management solution that allows IT administrators to manage and monitor all of an organization's devices, including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, workstations, and smart TVs.  The platform functions as a channel to push mandatory software and updates, change device settings, and even remotely wipe devices, all of which is delivered from a central server.   The two issues identified by the operational technology firm relate to an authentication bypass (CVE-2022-34907) a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An information-stealing malware called Amadey is being distributed by means of another backdoor called SmokeLoader.  The attacks hinge on tricking users into downloading SmokeLoader that masquerades as software cracks, paving the way for the deployment of Amadey, researchers from the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)  said  in a report published last week.   Amadey , a botnet that  first appeared  around October 2018 on Russian underground forums for $600, is equipped to siphon crendentials, capture screenshots, system metadata, and even information about antivirus engines and additional malware installed on an infected machine.   While an update was spotted last July by Walmart Global Tech  incorporated  functionality for harvesting data from Mikrotik routers and Microsoft Outlook, the toolset has since been upgraded to capture information from FileZilla, Pidgin, Total Commander FTP Client, RealVNC, TightVNC, TigerVNC, and WinSCP.

Malicious actors are exploiting a previously unknown security flaw in the open source PrestaShop e-commerce platform to inject malicious skimmer code designed to swipe sensitive information.  "Attackers have found a way to use a security vulnerability to carry out arbitrary code execution in servers running PrestaShop websites," the company  noted  in an advisory published on July 22.  PrestaShop is  marketed  as the leading open-source e-commerce solution in Europe and Latin America, used by nearly 300,000 online merchants worldwide.   The goal of the infections is to introduce malicious code capable of stealing payment information entered by customers on checkout pages. Shops using outdated versions of the software or other vulnerable third-party modules appear to be the prime targets.   The PrestaShop maintainers also said they found a zero-day flaw in its service that they said has been addressed in  version 1.7.8.7 , although they cautioned that "we cannot be sure

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is now taking steps to prevent Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute-force attacks as part of the latest builds for the Windows 11 operating system in an attempt to raise the  security baseline  to meet the evolving threat landscape.  To that end, the default policy for Windows 11 builds – particularly, Insider Preview builds 22528.1000 and newer – will automatically lock accounts for 10 minutes after 10 invalid sign-in attempts.  "Win11 builds now have a DEFAULT account lockout policy to mitigate RDP and other brute-force password vectors," David Weston, Microsoft's vice president for OS security and enterprise,  said  in a series of tweets last week. "This technique is very commonly used in Human Operated Ransomware and other attacks -- this control will make brute forcing much harder which is awesome!"   It's worth pointing out that while this  account lockout setting  is already incorporated in Windows 10, it's not enabled by default.  The f

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown Chinese-speaking threat actor has been attributed to a new kind of sophisticated UEFI firmware rootkit called  CosmicStrand .  "The rootkit is located in the firmware images of Gigabyte or ASUS motherboards, and we noticed that all these images are related to designs using the H81 chipset," Kaspersky researchers  said  in a new report published today. "This suggests that a common vulnerability may exist that allowed the attackers to inject their rootkit into the firmware's image."  Victims identified are said to be private individuals located in China, Vietnam, Iran, and Russia, with no discernible ties to any organization or industry vertical. The attribution to a Chinese-speaking threat actor stems from code overlaps between CosmicStrand and other malware such as the MyKings botnet and MoonBounce.  Rootkits, which are malware implants that are capable of embedding themselves in the deepest layers of the operating system, are morphed from a rarity t

Magecart Hacks Food Ordering Systems to Steal Payment Data from Over 300 Restaurants<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/magecart-hacks-online-food-ordering.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Three restaurant ordering platforms MenuDrive, Harbortouch, and InTouchPOS were the target of two Magecart skimming campaigns that resulted in the compromise of at least 311 restaurants.  The trio of breaches has led to the theft of more than 50,000 payment card records from these infected restaurants and posted for sale on the dark web.  "The online ordering platforms MenuDrive and Harbortouch were targeted by the same Magecart campaign, resulting in e-skimmer infections on 80 restaurants using MenuDrive and 74 using Harbortouch," cybersecurity firm Recorded Future  revealed  in a report.  "InTouchPOS was targeted by a separate, unrelated Magecart campaign, resulting in e-skimmer infections on 157 restaurants using the platform."   Magecart actors have a history of  infecting e-commerce websites  with JavaScript skimmers to steal online shoppers' payment card data, billing information, and other personally identifiable information (PII).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Racoon Stealer malware as a service platform gained notoriety several years ago for its ability to extract data that is stored within a Web browser. This data initially included passwords and cookies, which sometimes allow a recognized device to be authenticated without a password being entered. Racoon Stealer was also designed to steal auto-fill data, which can include a vast trove of personal information ranging from basic contact data to credit card numbers. As if all of that were not enough, Racoon Stealer also had the ability to steal cryptocurrency and to steal (or drop) files on an infected system.  As bad as Racoon Stealer might have been, its developers have recently created a new version that is designed to be far more damaging than the version that previously existed.    New Racoon Stealer Capabilities  The new version of Raccoon Stealer  still has the ability to steal browser passwords, cookies, and auto-fill data.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The mobile threat campaign tracked as  Roaming Mantis  has been linked to a new wave of compromises directed against French mobile phone users, months after it expanded its targeting to include European countries.  No fewer than 70,000 Android devices are said to have been infected as part of the active malware operation, Sekoia said in a report published last week.  Attack chains involving  Roaming Mantis , a financially motivated Chinese threat actor, are known to either deploy a piece of banking trojan named MoqHao (aka XLoader) or redirect iPhone users to credential harvesting landing pages that mimic the iCloud login page.   "MoqHao (aka Wroba, XLoader for Android) is an Android remote access trojan (RAT) with information-stealing and backdoor capabilities that likely spreads via SMS," Sekoia researchers  said .   It all starts with a phishing SMS, a technique known as smishing, enticing users with package delivery-themed messages containing rogue links, that, when clic

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Network security company SonicWall on Friday rolled out fixes to mitigate a critical SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability affecting its Analytics On-Prem and Global Management System (GMS) products.  The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2022-22280 , is rated 9.4 for severity on the CVSS scoring system and stems from what the company describes is an "improper neutralization of special elements" used in an SQL command that could lead to an unauthenticated SQL injection.

Microsoft has officially resumed blocking Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros by default across Office apps, weeks after temporarily announcing plans to roll back the change.  "Based on our review of customer feedback, we've made updates to both our  end user  and our  IT admin  documentation to make clearer what options you have for different scenarios," the company  said  in an update on July 20.  Earlier this February, Microsoft publicized its plans to disable macros by default in Office applications such as Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, and Word as a way to prevent threat actors from abusing the feature to deliver malware.  It's a known fact that a majority of the damaging cyberattacks today leverage email-based phishing lures to spread bogus documents containing malicious macros as a primary vector for initial access.   "Macros can add a lot of functionality to Office, but they are often used by people with bad intentions to distribute malware to

Google on Thursday said it's backtracking on a  recent change  that removed the app permissions list from the Google Play Store for Android across both the mobile app and the web.  "Privacy and transparency are core values in the Android community," the Android Developers team  said  in a series of tweets. "We heard your feedback that you find the app permissions section in Google Play useful, and we've decided to reinstate it. The app permissions section will be back shortly."  To that end, in addition to showcasing the new Data safety section that offers users a simplified summary of an app's data collection, processing, and security practices, Google also intends to highlight all the permissions required by the app to make sense of its "ability to access specific restricted data and actions."   The reinstatement comes as the internet giant moved to swap out the apps permission section with the newer Data safety labels last week ahead of the

Python has its pros and cons, but it's nonetheless used extensively. For example, Python is frequently used in data crunching tasks even when there are more appropriate languages to choose from.  Why? Well, Python is relatively easy to learn. Someone with a science background can pick up Python much more quickly than, say, C. However, Python's inherent approachability also creates a couple of problems.  Whenever Python is updated, it means a big refactoring workload, which often gets dealt with poorly – or not at all. That leads to poor performance and security vulnerabilities. But maybe there is a better way: a tool to keep your Python tasks running smoothly and securely day in, day out. Let's take a look.  It's slow, but it does the job  Python isn't the fastest language around, but despite its comparative disadvantages, you'll often see it used for intensive data crunching operations. Think machine learning, computer vision, or even pure math in high-perform

Ukrainian radio operator TAVR Media on Thursday became the latest victim of a cyberattack, resulting in the broadcast of a fake message that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was seriously ill.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A never-before-seen Linux malware has been dubbed a "Swiss Army Knife" for its modular architecture and its capability to install rootkits.  This previously undetected Linux threat, called  Lightning Framework  by Intezer, is equipped with a plethora of features, making it one of the most intricate frameworks developed for targeting Linux systems.  "The framework has both passive and active capabilities for communication with the threat actor, including opening up SSH on an infected machine, and a polymorphic malleable command and control configuration," Intezer researcher Ryan Robinson  said  in a new report published today.   Central to the malware is a downloader ("kbioset") and a core ("kkdmflush") module, the former of which is engineered to retrieve at least seven different plugins from a remote server that are subsequently invoked by the core component.  In addition, the downloader is also responsible for establishing the persistence of t

"This access could be leveraged in a variety of ways including deeper access or to launch additional attacks, including the potential for software supply chain compromise," Cisco Talos  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.   Although there are no concrete indicators linking the attack to a single actor or group, the cybersecurity firm's assessment points to Russian nation-state activity.  Public reporting into the use of GoMet in real-world attacks has so far uncovered only two documented cases to date: one in 2020, coinciding with the disclosure of  CVE-2020-5902 , a critical remot

The advanced persistent threat (APT) actor tracked as Evilnum is once again exhibiting signs of renewed activity aimed at European financial and investment entities.  "Evilnum is a backdoor that can be used for data theft or to load additional payloads," enterprise security firm Proofpoint  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The malware includes multiple interesting components to evade detection and modify infection paths based on identified antivirus software."  Targets include organizations with operations supporting foreign exchanges, cryptocurrency, and decentralized finance (DeFi). The latest spate of attacks are said to have commenced in late 2021.  The findings also dovetail with a report from Zscaler last month that  detailed  low-volume targeted attack campaigns launched against companies in Europe and the U.K.   Active since 2018,  Evilnum  is tracked by the wider cybersecurity community using the names TA4563 and DeathStalker, with infection

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Typically, when threat actors look to infiltrate an organization's SaaS apps, they look to SaaS app misconfigurations as a means of entry. However, employees now use their personal devices, whether their phones or laptops, etc., to get their jobs done. If the device's hygiene is not up to par, it increases the risk for the organization and widens the attack surface for bad actors. And so, Endpoint (Device) Protection — through EDR, XDR, and vulnerability management solutions – has arisen as a critical factor in SaaS Security.  The challenge in remediating the threats posed by endpoints and devices lies in the ability to correlate between the SaaS app users, their roles, and permissions with their associated devices' compliance and integrity levels. This end-to-end approach is what's needed for the organization to implement a holistic, zero-trust approach for their SaaS Security.   Not a simple feat, however, automated SaaS Security Posture Management solutions, like Ad

Atlassian has rolled out fixes to remediate a critical security vulnerability pertaining to the use of hard-coded credentials affecting  the Questions For Confluence  app for Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center.  The flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-26138 , arises when the app in question is enabled on either of two services, causing it to create a Confluence user account with the username "disabledsystemuser."  While this account, Atlassian says, is to help administrators migrate data from the app to Confluence Cloud, it's also created with a hard-coded password, effectively allowing viewing and editing all non-restricted pages within Confluence by default.   "A remote, unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded password could exploit this to log into Confluence and access any pages the  confluence-users group  has access to," the company  said  in an advisory, adding that "the hard-coded password is trivial to obtain after downloading an

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has announced the seizure of $500,000 worth of Bitcoin from North Korean hackers who extorted digital payments from several organizations by using a new ransomware strain known as Maui.  "The seized funds include ransoms paid by healthcare providers in Kansas and Colorado," the DoJ  said  in a press release issued Tuesday.  The recovery of the bitcoin ransoms comes after the agency said it took control of two cryptocurrency accounts that were used to receive payments to the tune of $100,000 and $120,000 from the medical centers. The DoJ did not disclose where the rest of the payments originated from.   "Reporting cyber incidents to law enforcement and cooperating with investigations not only protects the United States, it is also good business," said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Growing cyber threats, tightening regulatory demands and strict cyber insurance requirements are driving small to medium-sized enterprises demand for strategic cybersecurity and compliance guidance and management. Since most companies this size don't have in-house CISO expertise – the demand for virtual CISO (vCISO) services is also growing. Yet current vCISO services models still rely on manual, humanCISO expertise. This makes these services costly and tough to scale – leaving MSPs, MSSPs and consulting firms unable to add vCISO service to their portfolio or scale their existing vCISO services to meet the growing demand.  This is the challenge  Cynomi's Automated vCISO platform  is trying to solve. The company's AI-powered vCISO platform automatically generates everything vCISO service providers need to provide their clients, fully customized for each and every client: risk and compliance assessments, gap analysis, tailored security policies, strategic remediation plans w

Google Adds Support for DNS-over-HTTP/3 in Android to Keep DNS Queries Private<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/google-adds-support-for-dns-over-http3.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday officially announced support for DNS-over-HTTP/3 (DoH3) for Android devices as part of a Google Play system update designed to keep DNS queries private.  To that end, Android smartphones running Android 11 and higher are expected to use DoH3 instead of DNS-over-TLS (DoT), which was incorporated into the mobile operating system with Android 9.0.  DoH3 is also an alternative to DNS-over-HTTPS ( DoH ), a mechanism for carrying out remote Domain Name System (DNS) resolution through an encrypted connection, effectively preventing third parties from snooping on users' browsing activities.   HTTP/3 , the first major upgrade to the hypertext transfer protocol since HTTP/2 was introduced in May 2015, is designed to use a new transport layer protocol called  QUIC  that's already supported by major browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.   The low-latency protocol, developed by Google in 2012, relies on the User Datagram Protoc

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Kaspersky security researchers have disclosed details of a brand-new ransomware family written in Rust, making it the third strain after  BlackCat  and  Hive  to use the programming language.  Luna, as it's called, is "fairly simple" and can run on Windows, Linux, and ESXi systems, with the malware banking on a combination of  Curve25519  and  AES  for encryption.   "Both the Linux and ESXi samples are compiled using the same source code with some minor changes from the Windows version," the Russian firm  noted  in a report published today.  Advertisements for Luna on darknet forums suggest that the ransomware is intended for use only by Russian-speaking affiliates. Its core developers are also believed to be of Russian origin owing to spelling mistakes in the ransom note hard-coded within the binary.  "Luna confirms the trend for cross-platform ransomware," the researchers stated, adding how the platform agnostic nature of languages like Golang and R

The 8220 cryptomining group  has expanded in size to encompass as many as 30,000 infected hosts, up from 2,000 hosts globally in mid-2021.  "8220 Gang is one of the many low-skill crimeware gangs we continually observe infecting cloud hosts and operating a botnet and cryptocurrency miners through known vulnerabilities and remote access brute forcing infection vectors," Tom Hegel of SentinelOne  said  in a Monday report.  The growth is said to have been fueled through the use of Linux and common cloud application vulnerabilities and poorly secured configurations for services such as Docker, Apache WebLogic, and Redis.   Active since early 2017, the Chinese-speaking, Monero-mining threat actor was most recently  seen  targeting i686 and x86_64 Linux systems by means of weaponizing a recent remote code execution exploit for Atlassian Confluence Server (CVE-2022-26134) to drop the PwnRig miner payload.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is warning of a handful of unpatched security vulnerabilities in  MiCODUS MV720  Global Positioning System (GPS) trackers outfitted in over 1.5 million vehicles that could lead to remote disruption of critical operations.  "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote actor to exploit access and gain control of the global positioning system tracker," CISA  said . "These vulnerabilities could impact access to a vehicle fuel supply, vehicle control, or allow locational surveillance of vehicles in which the device is installed."  Available on sale for $20 and manufactured by the China-based MiCODUS, the company's tracking devices are employed by major organizations in 169 countries spanning aerospace, energy, engineering, government, manufacturing, nuclear power plant, and shipping sectors.

The Great Resignation – or the Great Reshuffle as some are calling it – and the growing skills gap have been dominating headlines lately. But these issues aren't new to the cybersecurity industry. While many are just now hearing about employee burnout, security teams have faced reality and serious consequences of burnout for years.   One of the biggest culprits? Alert overload.   The average security team gets tens of thousands of alerts  each day . Many analysts feel like they can't get their heads above water…and are starting to give up. This looks like physical burnout and even apathy. Surveys found that some security analysts feel so overwhelmed they ignore alerts and even walk away from their computers.   In fact, these surveys found that  70% of security teams  feel emotionally overwhelmed by alerts, and more than  55% of security professionals  don't feel fully confident that they can prioritize and respond to every alert that really does need attention.   Sadly, th

Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) attributed the malware to Turla, an advanced persistent threat also known as Krypton, Venomous Bear, Waterbug, and Uroburos, and linked to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).  "This is the first known instance of Turla distributing Android-related malware," TAG researcher Billy Leonard  said . "The apps were not distributed through the Google Play Store, but hosted on a domain controlled by the actor and disseminated via links on third party messaging services."   It's worth noting that the  onslaught  of  cyberattacks  in the immediate aftermath of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine prompted the latter to  form an IT Army  to stage counter-DDoS attacks against Russian website

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Russian state-sponsored hacking collective known as APT29 has been attributed to a new phishing campaign that takes advantage of legitimate cloud services like Google Drive and Dropbox to deliver malicious payloads on compromised systems.  "These campaigns are believed to have targeted several Western diplomatic missions between May and June 2022," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42  said  in a Tuesday report. "The lures included in these campaigns suggest targeting of a foreign embassy in Portugal as well as a foreign embassy in Brazil."  APT29, also tracked under the monikers Cozy Bear, Cloaked Ursa, or The Dukes, has been characterized as an organized cyberespionage group working to collect intelligence that aligns with Russia's strategic objectives.  Some aspects of the advanced persistent threat's activities, including the infamous  SolarWinds supply chain attack  of 2020, are separately tracked by Microsoft under the name Nobelium, with Mandiant calling i

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a previously undocumented spyware targeting the Apple macOS operating system.  The malware, codenamed  CloudMensis  by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, is said to exclusively use public cloud storage services such as pCloud, Yandex Disk, and Dropbox for receiving attacker commands and exfiltrating files.  "Its capabilities clearly show that the intent of its operators is to gather information from the victims' Macs by exfiltrating documents, keystrokes, and screen captures," ESET researcher Marc-Etienne M.Léveillé  said  in a report published today.   CloudMensis, written in Objective-C, was first discovered in April 2022 and is designed to strike both Intel and Apple silicon architectures. The initial infection vector for the attacks and the targets remain unknown as yet. But its very limited distribution is an indication that the malware is being used as part of a highly targeted operation directed against entities of i

Security Experts Warn of Two Primary Client-Side Risks Associated with Data Exfiltration and Loss<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/security-experts-warn-of-two-primary.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two client-side risks dominate the problems with data loss and data exfiltration: improperly placed trackers on websites and web applications and malicious client-side code pulled from third-party repositories like NPM.   Client-side security researchers are finding that improperly placed trackers, while not intentionally malicious, are a growing problem and have clear and significant privacy implications when it comes to both compliance/regulatory concerns, like HIPAA or PCI DSS 4.0. To highlight the risks with misplaced trackers, a  recent study  by The Markup (a non-profit news organization) examined Newsweek's top 100 hospitals in America. They found a Facebook tracker on one-third of the hospital websites which sent Facebook highly personal healthcare data whenever the user clicked the "schedule appointment" button. The data was not necessarily anonymized, because the data was connected to an IP address, and both the IP address and the appointment information get delivered to Fac

New Air-Gap Attack Uses SATA Cable as an Antenna to Transfer Radio Signals<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/new-air-gap-attack-uses-sata-cable-as.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new method devised to leak information and jump over air-gaps takes advantage of Serial Advanced Technology Attachment ( SATA ) or Serial ATA cables as a communication medium, adding to a  long list  of electromagnetic, magnetic, electric, optical, and acoustic methods already demonstrated to plunder data.  "Although air-gap computers have no wireless connectivity, we show that attackers can use the SATA cable as a wireless antenna to transfer radio signals at the 6GHz frequency band," Dr. Mordechai Guri, the head of R&D in the Cyber Security Research Center in the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel,  wrote  in a paper published last week.  The technique, dubbed  SATAn , takes advantage of the prevalence of the computer bus interface, making it "highly available to attackers in a wide range of computer systems and IT environments."  Put simply, the goal is to use the SATA cable as a covert channel to emanate electromagnetic signals and transfer a br

Google has taken steps to ax dozens of fraudulent apps from the official Play Store that were spotted propagating Joker, Facestealer, and Coper malware families through the virtual marketplace.  While the Android storefront is considered to be a trusted source for discovering and installing apps, bad actors have repeatedly found ways to sneak past security barriers erected by Google in hopes of luring unsuspecting users into downloading malware-laced apps.  The latest findings from  Zscaler ThreatLabz  and  Pradeo  are no different. "Joker is one of the most  prominent malware families  targeting Android devices," researchers Viral Gandhi and Himanshu Sharma said in a Monday report.  "Despite public awareness of this particular malware, it keeps finding its way into Google's official app store by regularly modifying the malware's trace signatures including updates to the code, execution methods, and payload-retrieving techniques."

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has warned of cyber criminals building rogue cryptocurrency-themed apps to defraud investors in the virtual assets space.  "The FBI has observed cyber criminals contacting U.S. investors, fraudulently claiming to offer legitimate cryptocurrency investment services, and convincing investors to download fraudulent mobile apps, which the cyber criminals have used with increasing success over time to defraud the investors of their cryptocurrency," the agency  said  [PDF].   The illicit scheme, which aims to take advantage of increased interest in the crypto sector, is believed to have netted 244 victims, with losses estimated at $42.7 million between October 4, 2021, and May 13, 2022.  According to the law enforcement authority, threat actors are misusing the names, logos, and other identifying information of legitimate businesses to create fake websites in an attempt to lure potential investors.

New Study Finds Most Enterprise Vendors Failing to Mitigate Speculative Execution Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/new-study-finds-most-enterprise-vendors.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
With speculative execution attacks remaining a stubbornly persistent vulnerability ailing modern processors, new research has highlighted an "industry failure" to adopting mitigations released by AMD and Intel, posing a firmware supply chain threat.  Dubbed  FirmwareBleed  by Binarly, the information leaking assaults stem from the continued exposure of microarchitectural attack surfaces on the part of enterprise vendors either as a result of not correctly incorporating the fixes or only using them partially.  "The impact of such attacks is focused on disclosing the content from privileged memory (including protected by virtualization technologies) to obtain sensitive data from processes running on the same processor (CPU)," the firmware protection firm  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "Cloud environments can have a greater impact when a physical server can be shared by multiple users or legal entities."  In recent years, implementations of

Thai activists involved in the country's pro-democracy protests have had their smartphones infected with the infamous Pegasus government-sponsored spyware.  At least 30 individuals, spanning activists, academics, lawyers, and NGO workers, are believed to have been infected between October 2020 and November 2021, many of whom have been previously detained, arrested and imprisoned for their political activities or criticism of the government.  "The timing of the infections is highly relevant to specific political events in Thailand, as well as specific actions by the Thai justice system," the Citizen Lab  said  in a Sunday report. "In many cases, for example, infections occurred slightly before protests and other political activities by the victims."  The findings are the result of  threat notifications  sent by Apple last November to alert users it believes have been targeted by state-sponsored attackers.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers from Wordfence have  sounded  the alarm about a "sudden" spike in cyber attacks attempting to exploit an unpatched flaw in a WordPress plugin called  Kaswara Modern WPBakery Page Builder Addons .  Tracked as  CVE-2021-24284 , the issue is rated 10.0 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system and relates to an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload that could be abused to gain code execution, permitting attackers to seize control of affected WordPress sites.   Although the bug was originally  disclosed  in April 2021 by the WordPress security company, it continues to remain unresolved to date. To make matters worse, the plugin has been closed and is no longer actively maintained.  Wordfence, which is protecting over 1,000 websites that have the plugin installed, said it has blocked an average of 443,868 attack attempts per day since the start of the month.   The attacks have emanated from 10,215 IP addresses, with a majority of the exploitation attempts narrowed down

Hackers Distributing Password Cracking Tool for PLCs and HMIs to Target Industrial Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/hackers-distributing-password-cracking.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Industrial engineers and operators are the target of a new campaign that leverages password cracking software to seize control of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and co-opt the machines to a botnet.  The software "exploited a vulnerability in the firmware which allowed it to retrieve the password on command," Dragos security researcher Sam Hanson  said . "Further, the software was a malware dropper, infecting the machine with the Sality  malware and turning the host into a peer in Sality's peer-to-peer botnet."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Juniper Networks has pushed security updates to address  several vulnerabilities  affecting multiple products, some of which could be exploited to seize control of affected systems.  The most critical of the flaws affect Junos Space and Contrail Networking, with the tech company urging customers to release versions 22.1R1 and 21.4.0, respectively.  Chief among them is a collection of 31 bugs in the Junos Space network management software, including CVE-2021-23017 (CVSS score: 9.4) that could result in a crash of vulnerable devices or even achieve arbitrary code execution.   "A security issue in nginx resolver was identified, which might allow an attacker who is able to forge UDP packets from the DNS server to cause 1-byte memory overwrite, resulting in worker process crash or potential other impact," the company  said .  The same security vulnerability has also been  remediated  in Northstar Controller in versions 5.1.0 Service Pack 6 and 6.2.2.  Additionally, the networking

Google Removes "App Permissions" List from Play Store for New "Data Safety" Section<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/google-removes-app-permissions-list.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Following the launch of a new "Data safety" section for the Android app on the Play Store, Google appears to be readying to remove the app permissions list from both the mobile app and the web.  The change was  highlighted  by Esper's Mishaal Rahman earlier this week.  The  Data safety  section, which Google began rolling out in late April 2022, is the company's answer to Apple's Privacy Nutrition Labels in iOS, allowing users to have a unified view of an app's data collection and processing practices.   To that end, third-party app developers are required to furnish the required details by July 20, 2022. With this deadline now approaching next week, the tech giant has moved to entirely remove the permissions section.  The decision also appears to be a hasty one, as a number of popular apps such as Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Amazon (including Amazon Prime Video), DuckDuckGo, Discord, and PhonePe are yet to populate their Data safety sections.

Hackers Targeting VoIP Servers By Exploiting Digium Phone Software<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/hackers-targeting-voip-servers-by.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VoIP phones using Digium's software have been targeted to drop a web shell on their servers as part of an attack campaign designed to exfiltrate data by downloading and executing additional payloads.  "The malware installs multilayer obfuscated PHP backdoors to the web server's file system, downloads new payloads for execution, and schedules recurring tasks to re-infect the host system," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42  said  in a Friday report.  The unusual activity is said to have commenced in mid-December 2021 and targets Asterisk, a widely used software implementation of a private branch exchange (PBX) that runs on the open-source Elastix Unified Communications Server.   Unit 42 said the intrusions share similarities with the  INJ3CTOR3 campaign  that Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point disclosed in November 2020, alluding to the possibility that they could be a "resurgence" of the previous attacks.   Coinciding with the sudden surge is the public disclos

New Netwrix Auditor Bug Could Let Attackers Compromise Active Directory Domain<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/new-netwrix-auditor-bug-could-let.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed details about a security vulnerability in the Netwrix Auditor application that, if successfully exploited, could lead to arbitrary code execution on affected devices.   "Since this service is typically executed with extensive privileges in an Active Directory environment, the attacker would likely be able to compromise the Active Directory domain," Bishop Fox  said  in an advisory published this week.   Auditor  is an auditing and visibility platform that enables organizations to have a consolidated view of their IT environments, including Active Directory, Exchange, file servers, SharePoint, VMware, and other systems—all from a single console.  Netwrix, the company behind the software, claims more than 11,500 customers across over 100 countries, such as Airbus, Virgin, King's College Hospital, and Credissimo, among others.   The flaw, which impacts all supported versions prior to 10.5, has been described as an  insecure object deserialization

New survey reveals lack of staff, skills, and resources driving smaller teams to outsource security.  As business begins its return to normalcy (however "normal" may look), CISOs at small and medium-size enterprises (500 – 10,000 employees) were asked to share their  cybersecurity challenges and priorities , and their responses were compared the results with those of a similar survey from 2021.  Here are the 5 key things we learned from 200 responses:  1  —  Remote Work Has Accelerated the Use of EDR Technologies  In 2021, 52% of CISOs surveyed were relying on endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. This year that number has leapt to 85%. In contrast, last year 45% were using network detection and response (NDR) tools, while this year just 6% employ NDR. Compared to 2021, double the number of CISOs and their organizations are seeing the value of extended detection and response (XDR) tools, which combine EDR with integrated network signals. This is likely due to the increase in re

A group of academics from the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) has warned of a novel technique that could be used to defeat  anonymity protections  and identify a unique website visitor.  "An attacker who has complete or partial control over a website can learn whether a specific target (i.e., a unique individual) is browsing the website," the researchers  said . "The attacker knows this target only through a public identifier, such as an email address or a Twitter handle."  The cache-based targeted  de-anonymization attack  is a  cross-site leak  that involves the adversary leveraging a service such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or YouTube to privately share a resource (e.g., image, video, or a YouTube playlist) with the target, followed by embedding the shared resource into the attack website.  This can be achieved by, say, privately sharing the resource with the target using the victim's email address or the appropriate username associated with the serv

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An emerging threat cluster originating from North Korea has been linked to developing and using ransomware in cyberattacks targeting small businesses since September 2021.  The group, which calls itself H0lyGh0st after the ransomware payload of the same name, is being tracked by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center under the moniker DEV-0530, a designation assigned for unknown, emerging, or a developing group of threat activity.  Targeted entities primarily include small-to-midsize businesses such as manufacturing organizations, banks, schools, and event and meeting planning companies.  "Along with their H0lyGh0st payload, DEV-0530 maintains an .onion site that the group uses to interact with their victims," the researchers  said  in a Thursday analysis.  "The group's standard methodology is to encrypt all files on the target device and use the file extension .h0lyenc, send the victim a sample of the files as proof, and then demand payment in Bitcoin in exchange

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The botnet behind the largest HTTPS distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in June 2022 has been linked to a spate of attacks aimed at nearly 1,000 Cloudflare customers.  Calling the powerful botnet  Mantis , the web performance and security company attributed it to more than 3,000 HTTP DDoS attacks against its users.  The most attacked industry verticals include internet and telecom, media, gaming, finance, business, and shopping, of which over 20% of the attacks targeted U.S.-based companies, followed by Russia, Turkey, France, Poland, Ukraine, the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, and Canada.   Last month, the company said it  mitigated  a record-breaking DDoS attack aimed at an unnamed customer website using its Free plan that peaked at 26 million requests per second (RPS), with each node generating approximately 5,200 RPS.  The tsunami of junk traffic lasted less than 30 seconds and generated more than 212 million HTTPS requests from more than 1,500 networks in 121 countries,

Joshua Schulte, a former programmer with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), has been found guilty of leaking a trove of classified hacking tools and exploits dubbed  Vault 7  to WikiLeaks.  The 33-year-old engineer had been  charged  in June 2018 with unauthorized disclosure of classified information and theft of classified material. Schulte also  faces  a separate trial on charges related to possession of child pornographic photos and videos, for which he was arrested on August 24, 2017.   U.S. Attorney Damian Williams  said  in a statement that Schulte was convicted for "one of the most brazen and damaging acts of espionage in American history," adding his actions had a "devastating effect on our intelligence community by providing critical intelligence to those who wish to do us harm."  WikiLeaks would go on to release the documents on March 7, 2017,  calling  it the "largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency." This incl

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Nation-state hacking groups aligned with China, Iran, North Korea, and Turkey have been targeting journalists to conduct espionage and spread malware as part of a series of campaigns since early 2021.  "Most commonly, phishing attacks targeting journalists are used for espionage or to gain key insights into the inner workings of another government, company, or other area of state-designated import," Proofpoint  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The ultimate goal of the intrusions, the enterprise security firm said, is to gain a competitive intelligence edge or spread disinformation and propaganda.   Proofpoint said it identified two Chinese hacking groups, TA412 (aka  Zirconium  or Judgment Panda) and  TA459 , targeting media personnel with malicious emails containing web beacons and weaponized documents respectively that were used to amass information about the recipients' network environments and drop  Chinoxy  malware.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Although there is a greater awareness of cybersecurity threats than ever before, it is becoming increasingly difficult for IT departments to get their security budgets approved. Security budgets seem to shrink each year and IT pros are constantly being asked to do more with less. Even so, the situation may not be hopeless. There are some things that IT pros can do to improve the chances of getting their security budgets approved.   Presenting the Problem in a Compelling Way  If you want to get your proposed security budget approved, you will need to present security problems in a compelling way. While those who are in charge of the organization's finances are likely aware of the need for good security, they have probably also seen enough examples of "a security solution in search of a problem" to make them skeptical of security spending requests. If you want to persuade those who control the money, then you will need to convince them of three things:   You are trying to

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Wednesday shed light on a now patched security vulnerability affecting Apple's operating systems that, if successfully exploited, could allow attackers to escalate device privileges and deploy malware.  "An attacker could take advantage of this sandbox escape vulnerability to gain elevated privileges on the affected device or execute malicious commands like installing additional payloads," Jonathan Bar Or of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team  said  in a write-up.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-26706  (CVSS score: 5.5), the security vulnerability impacts iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS and was fixed by Apple in May 2022.   Calling it an access issue affecting the LaunchServices (launchd) component, the tech giant noted that "A sandboxed process may be able to circumvent sandbox restrictions," adding it mitigates the issue with additional restrictions.  While Apple's  App Sandbox  is designed to tightly regulate a third-party app's access

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as Transparent Tribe  has been attributed to a new ongoing phishing campaign targeting students at various educational institutions in India at least since December 2021.  "This new campaign also suggests that the APT is actively expanding its network of victims to include civilian users," Cisco Talos  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Also tracked under the monikers APT36, Operation C-Major, PROJECTM, Mythic Leopard, the Transparent Tribe actor is  suspected  to be of Pakistani origin and is known to strike government entities and think tanks in India and Afghanistan with custom malware such as CrimsonRAT, ObliqueRAT, and CapraRAT.   But the targeting of educational institutions and students, first  observed  by India-based K7 Labs in May 2022, indicates a deviation from the adversary's typical focus.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have uncovered yet another vulnerability affecting numerous older AMD and Intel microprocessors that could bypass current defenses and result in Spectre-based speculative-execution attacks.  Dubbed  Retbleed  by ETH Zurich researchers Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi, the issues are tracked as CVE-2022-29900 (AMD) and CVE-2022-29901 (Intel), with the chipmakers  releasing   software   mitigations  as part of a coordinated disclosure process.  Retbleed is also the latest addition to a class of  Spectre attacks  known as Spectre-BTI (CVE-2017-5715 or Spectre-V2), which exploit the side effects of an optimization technique called  speculative execution  by means of a timing side channel to trick a program into accessing arbitrary locations in its memory space and leak private information.   Speculative execution attempts to fill the instruction pipeline of a program by predicting which instruction will be executed next in order to gain a performance boost, while also

U.S. FTC Vows to Crack Down on illegal Use and Sharing of Citizens' Sensitive Data<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/us-ftc-vows-to-crack-down-on-illegal.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned this week that it will crack down on tech companies' illegal use and sharing of highly sensitive data and false claims about data anonymization.  "While many consumers may happily offer their location data in exchange for real-time crowd-sourced advice on the fastest route home, they likely think differently about having their thinly-disguised online identity associated with the frequency of their visits to a therapist or cancer doctor," FTC's Kristin Cohen  said .  The sensitive nature of information about users' health and their precise whereabouts has prompted the agency to caution against opaque practices in the "shadowy ad tech and  data broker ecosystem ," with consumers having little to no knowledge of how their personal data is harvested, used, and processed.   What's more, mobile apps are known to embed software development kits (SDKs) that claim to collect and share anonymized user information

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Consumer electronics maker Lenovo on Tuesday  rolled out fixes  to contain three security flaws in its UEFI firmware affecting over 70 product models.  "The vulnerabilities can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution in the early phases of the platform boot, possibly allowing the attackers to hijack the OS execution flow and disable some important security features," Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET  said  in a series of tweets.   Tracked as CVE-2022-1890, CVE-2022-1891, and CVE-2022-1892, all three bugs relate to  buffer overflow vulnerabilities  that have been described by Lenovo as leading to privilege escalation on affected systems. Martin Smolár from ESET has been credited with reporting the flaws.   The bugs stem from an insufficient validation of an NVRAM variable called "DataSize" in three different drivers ReadyBootDxe, SystemLoadDefaultDxe, and SystemBootManagerDxe, leading to a buffer overflow that could be weaponized to achieve code execution.

Microsoft on Tuesday disclosed that a large-scale phishing campaign targeted over 10,000 organizations since September 2021 by hijacking Office 365's authentication process even on accounts secured with multi-factor authentication (MFA).  "The attackers then used the stolen credentials and session cookies to access affected users' mailboxes and perform follow-on business email compromise (BEC) campaigns against other targets," the company's cybersecurity teams  reported .  The intrusions entailed setting up adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing sites, wherein the adversary deploys a proxy server between a potential victim and the targeted website so that recipients of a phishing email are redirected to lookalike landing pages designed to capture credentials and MFA information.  "The phishing page has two different Transport Layer Security (TLS) sessions — one with the target and another with the actual website the target wants to access," the company

Often, organizations think of firewall security as a one-and-done type of solution. They install firewalls, then assume that they are "good to go" without investigating whether or not these solutions are actually protecting their systems in the best way possible. "Set it and forget it!"  Instead of just relying on firewalls and assuming that they will always protect their businesses from cyber risk, executives need to start asking deeper questions about them. As with most areas of business, it's important to take a critical look at each solution that your organization relies on for security. So, let's break down a few questions that you and your team should be asking about firewall security to get a more accurate view into your network defense posture.  1 — What does your team's firewall knowledge look like?   In order to properly service and upkeep firewalls, your team needs to have at least a baseline knowledge of how firewalls operate. It's espe

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered new variants of the  ChromeLoader  information-stealing malware, highlighting its evolving feature set in a short span of time.  Primarily used for hijacking victims' browser searches and presenting advertisements, ChromeLoader came to light in January 2022 and has been distributed in the form of ISO or DMG file downloads advertised via QR codes on Twitter and free gaming sites.  ChromeLoader has also been codenamed Choziosi Loader and ChromeBack by the broader cybersecurity community. What makes the adware notable is that it's fashioned as a browser extension as opposed to a Windows executable (.exe) or Dynamic Link Library (.dll).   The infections typically work by enticing unsuspecting users into downloading movie torrents or cracked video games through malvertising campaigns on pay-per-install sites and social media.  Besides requesting invasive permissions to access browser data and manipulate web requests, it's also designed t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind the Qakbot malware are transforming their delivery vectors in an attempt to sidestep detection.  "Most recently, threat actors have transformed their techniques to evade detection by using ZIP file extensions, enticing file names with common formats, and Excel (XLM) 4.0 to trick victims into downloading malicious attachments that install Qakbot," Zscaler Threatlabz researchers Tarun Dewan and Aditya Sharma  said .   Other methods adopted by the group include code obfuscation, introducing new layers in the attack chain from initial compromise to execution, and using multiple URLs as well as unknown file extensions (e.g., .OCX, .ooccxx, .dat, or .gyp) to deliver the payload.  Also called QBot, QuackBot, or Pinkslipbot, Qakbot has been a  recurring threat  since late 2007, evolving from its initial days as a banking trojan to a modular information stealer capable of deploying next-stage payloads such as  ransomware .

Popular video-sharing platform TikTok on Tuesday agreed to pause a controversial privacy policy update that could have allowed it to serve targeted ads based on users' activity on the social video platform without their permission to do so.  The reversal, reported by  TechCrunch , comes a day after the Italian data protection authority — the Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali — warned the company against the change, citing violations of data protection laws.  "The personal data stored in users' devices may not be used to profile those users and send personalized ads without their explicit consent," the Garante  said .   The formal warning was in response to a privacy policy revision that noted it had historically asked users' "consent" to their on-TikTok activity and off-TikTok activity to serve personalized ads and that, therefore, it intends to stop asking users for their permission to profile their behavior and process personal data.

Avoiding Death by a Thousand Scripts: Using Automated Content Security Policies<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/avoiding-death-by-thousand-scripts.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Businesses know they need to secure their client-side scripts. Content security policies (CSPs) are a great way to do that. But CSPs are cumbersome. One mistake and you have a potentially significant client-side security gap. Finding those gaps means long and tedious hours (or days) in manual code reviews through thousands of lines of script on your web applications. Automated content security policies can help streamline the code review process by first identifying all first- and third-party scripts and the assets they access, and then generating an appropriate content security policy to help better secure the client-side attack surface.   There are few developers or AppSec professionals who claim to enjoy deploying CSPs. First, the CSP has to work for the specific web application. Then the team needs to make sure it provides the appropriate level of protection. The CSP also can't conflict with any existing widgets or plugins (or the decision must be made to not deploy the CSP or dea

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Monday announced the general availability of a feature called Autopatch  that automatically keeps Windows and Office software up-to-date on enrolled endpoints.  The launch, which comes a day before Microsoft is expected to release its monthly round of security patches, is available for customers with Windows Enterprise E3 and E5 licenses. It, however, doesn't support Windows Education (A3) or Windows Front Line Worker (F3) licenses.  "Microsoft will continue to release updates on the second Tuesday of every month and now Autopatch helps streamline updating operations and create new opportunities for IT pros," Lior Bela  said .   Autopatch works by  applying security updates  first to devices in what's called the Test ring, which contains a minimum number of representative devices. After a validation period, the updates are pushed to the First (1% devices), Fast (9%), and Broad (90%) rings.   The service was first  teased  by the tech giant in April 2022

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
GitHub Actions and Azure virtual machines (VMs) are being leveraged for cloud-based cryptocurrency mining, indicating sustained attempts on the part of malicious actors to target cloud resources for illicit purposes.  "Attackers can abuse the  runners  or servers provided by GitHub to run an organization's pipelines and automation by maliciously downloading and installing their own cryptocurrency miners to gain profit easily," Trend Micro researcher Magno Logan  said  in a report last week.  GitHub Actions ( GHAs ) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows users to automate the software build, test, and deployment pipeline. Developers can leverage the feature to create workflows that build and test every pull request to a code repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.   Both Linux and Windows runners are hosted on  Standard_DS2_v2  virtual machines on Azure and come with two vCPUs and 7GB of memory.  The Japanese com

It's not a new concept that Office 365, Salesforce, Slack, Google Workspace or Zoom, etc., are amazing for enabling the hybrid workforce and hyper-productivity in businesses today. However, there are three main challenges that have arisen stemming from this evolution: (1) While SaaS apps include a host of native security settings, they need to be hardened by the security team of the organization. (2) Employees are granting 3rd party app access to core SaaS apps that pose potential threats to the company. (3) These SaaS apps are accessed by different devices without their device hygiene score even being checked.   1 — Misconfiguration Management   It's not an easy task to have every app setting properly configured — at all times. The challenge lies within how burdensome this responsibility is — each app has tens or hundreds of security settings to configure, in addition to thousands of user roles and permission in a typical enterprise, compounded by the many compliance industry

The $540 million hack of Axie Infinity's  Ronin Bridge  in late March 2022 was the consequence of one of its former employees getting tricked by a fraudulent job offer on LinkedIn, it has emerged.   According to a report from  The Block  published last week citing two people familiar with the matter, a senior engineer at the company was duped into applying for a job at a non-existent company, causing the individual to download a fake offer document disguised as a PDF.  "After what one source described as multiple rounds of interviews, a Sky Mavis engineer was offered a job with an extremely generous compensation package," the Block reported.   The offer document subsequently acted as a conduit to deploy malware designed to breach Ronin's network, ultimately facilitating one of the crypto sector's biggest hacks to date.  "Sky Mavis employees are under constant advanced spear-phishing attacks on various social channels and one employee was compromised," t

The maintainers of the official third-party software repository for Python have begun imposing a new two-factor authentication (2FA) condition for projects deemed "critical."  "We've begun rolling out a 2FA requirement: soon, maintainers of critical projects must have 2FA enabled to publish, update, or modify them," Python Package Index (PyPI)  said  in a tweet last week.  "Any maintainer of a critical project (both 'Maintainers' and 'Owners') are included in the 2FA requirement," it  added .   Additionally, the developers of critical projects who have not previously turned on 2FA on PyPi are being offered free hardware security keys from the Google Open Source Security Team.  PyPI, which is run by the Python Software Foundation, houses more than 350,000 projects, of which over  3,500 projects  are said to be tagged with a "critical" designation.

A newly observed phishing campaign is leveraging the recently disclosed Follina security vulnerability to distribute a previously undocumented backdoor on Windows systems.  "Rozena is a backdoor malware that is capable of injecting a remote shell connection back to the attacker's machine," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin  said  in a report this week.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-30190 , the now-patched Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) remote code execution vulnerability has come under heavy exploitation in recent weeks ever since it came to light in late May 2022.  The starting point for the latest attack chain observed by Fortinet is a weaponized  Office document  that, when opened, connects to a  Discord CDN URL  to retrieve an HTML file (" index.htm ") that, in turn, invokes the diagnostic utility using a PowerShell command to download next-stage payloads from the same CDN attachment space.   This includes the Rozena implant ("Word

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are drawing attention to an ongoing wave of attacks linked to a threat cluster tracked as Raspberry Robin that's behind a Windows malware with worm-like capabilities.   Describing it as a "persistent" and "spreading" threat, Cybereason  said  it observed a number of victims in Europe.  The infections involve a worm that propagates over removable USB devices containing malicious a .LNK file and leverages compromised QNAP network-attached storage (NAS) devices for command-and-control. It was  first documented  by researchers from Red Canary in May 2022.   Also codenamed  QNAP worm  by Sekoia, the malware leverages a legitimate Windows installer binary called "msiexec.exe" to download and execute a malicious shared library (DLL) from a compromised QNAP NAS appliance.  "To make it harder to detect, Raspberry Robin leverages process injections in three legitimate Windows system processes," Cybereason researcher Loïc Cast

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
LockBit ransomware attacks are constantly evolving by making use of a wide range of techniques to infect targets while also taking steps to disable endpoint security solutions.  "The affiliates that use LockBit's services conduct their attacks according to their preference and use different tools and techniques to achieve their goal," Cybereason security analysts Loïc Castel and Gal Romano  said . "As the attack progresses further along the kill chain, the activities from different cases tend to converge to similar activities."  LockBit, which operates on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model like most groups, was first observed in September 2019 and has since emerged as the most dominant ransomware strain this year, surpassing other well-known groups like  Conti ,  Hive , and  BlackCat .   This involves the malware authors licensing access to affiliates, who execute the attacks in exchange for using their tools and infrastructure and earn as much as 80% of ea

Five months after announcing plans to disable Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros by default in the Office productivity suite, Microsoft appears to have rolled back its plans.

I apologize for any inconvenience of the rollback starting before the update about the change was made available."   In February 2022, the tech giant  said  it was disabling macros by default across its products, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, and Visio, for documents downloaded from the web in an attempt to mitigate potential attacks that abuse the functionality for deploying malware.   "Bad actors send macros in Office files to end users who unknowingly enable them, malicious payloads are delivered, and the impact can be severe including malware, compromised identity, data loss, and remote access," M

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Progress powers technology forward. But progress also has a cost: by adding new capabilities and features, the developer community is constantly adjusting the building blocks. That includes the fundamental languages used to code technology solutions.  When the building blocks change, the code behind the technology solution must change too. It's a challenging and time-consuming exercise that drains resources. But what if there's an alternative?  The problem: reading code someone else wrote  Let's take a step back and take a look at one of the fundamental challenges in development: editing someone else's code. Editing code you just wrote, or wrote a couple of weeks ago, is just fine. But editing your own code written years ago – never mind someone else's code - that's a different story.  In-house code style rules can help but there are always odd naming conventions for variables and functions, or unusual choices for algorithms. Arguably, a programmer's abilit

A malicious browser extension with 350 variants is masquerading as a Google Translate add-on as part of an adware campaign targeting Russian users of Google Chrome, Opera, and Mozilla Firefox browsers.  Mobile security firm Zimperium dubbed the malware family  ABCsoup , stating the "extensions are installed onto a victim's machine via a Windows-based executable, bypassing most endpoint security solutions, along with the security controls found in the official extension stores."  The rogue browser add-ons come with the same extension ID as that of Google Translate — " aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb " — in an attempt to trick users into believing that they have installed a legitimate extension.   The extensions are not available on the official browser web stores themselves. Rather they are delivered through different Windows executables that install the add-on on the victim's web browser.

TrickBot Gang Shifted its Focus on "Systematically" Targeting Ukraine<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/trickbot-malware-shifted-its-focus-on.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's being described as an "unprecedented" twist, the operators of the TrickBot malware have resorted to systematically targeting Ukraine since the onset of the war in late February 2022.  The group is believed to have orchestrated at least six phishing campaigns aimed at targets that align with Russian state interests, with the emails acting as lures for delivering malicious software such as IcedID, CobaltStrike, AnchorMail, and  Meterpreter .  Tracked under the names ITG23,  Gold Blackburn , and Wizard Spider, the  financially motivated cybercrime gang  is known for its development of the TrickBot banking trojan and was  subsumed  into the now-discontinued  Conti ransomware cartel  earlier this year.  But merely weeks later, the actors associated with the group resurfaced with a revamped version of the  AnchorDNS  backdoor called  AnchorMail  that uses SMTPS and IMAP protocols for command-and-control communications.

North Korean Maui Ransomware Actively Targeting U.S. Healthcare Organizations<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/north-korean-maui-ransomware-actively.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In a new joint cybersecurity advisory, U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have warned about the use of Maui ransomware by North Korean government-backed hackers to target the healthcare sector since at least May 2021.  "North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors used Maui ransomware in these incidents to encrypt servers responsible for healthcare services—including electronic health records services, diagnostics services, imaging services, and intranet services," the authorities  noted .  The  alert  comes courtesy of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of the Treasury.  Cybersecurity firm Stairwell, whose findings formed the basis of the advisory, said the lesser-known ransomware family stands out because of a lack of several key features commonly associated with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups.   This includes the absence of "embedded ransom note to provide recov

Researchers have disclosed a new large-scale cryptocurrency mining campaign targeting the NPM JavaScript package repository.  The malicious activity, attributed to a software supply chain threat actor dubbed  CuteBoi , involves an array of 1,283 rogue modules that were published in an automated fashion from over 1,000 different user accounts.  "This was done using automation which includes the ability to pass the NPM 2FA challenge," Israeli application security testing company Checkmarx  said . "This cluster of packages seems to be a part of an attacker experimenting at this point."   All the released packages in question are said to harbor near-identical source code from an already existing package named eazyminer that's used to mine Monero by means of utilizing unused resources on web servers.  One notable modification entails the URL to which the mined cryptocurrency should be sent, although installing the rogue modules will not bring about a negative effect

Lockdown Mode, when enabled, "hardens device defenses and strictly limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware," Apple  said  in a statement.   This includes blocking most message attachment types other than images and disabling link previews in Messages; rendering inoperative just-in-time ( JIT ) JavaScript compilation; removing support for shared albums in Photos; a

Do you remember that scene in Batman - The Dark Knight, where Batman uses a system that aggregates active sound data from countless mobile phones to create a meta sonar feed of what is going on at any given place?   It is an interesting analogy with what we do at CrowdSec. By aggregating intrusion signals from our community, we can offer a clear picture of what is going on in terms of illegal hacking in the world.  After 2 years of activity and analyzing 1 million intrusion signals daily from tens of thousands of users in 160 countries, we start having an accurate "Batman sonar" global feed of cyber threats. And there are some interesting takeaways to outline.  A cyber threat with many faces   First of all, the global cyber threat is highly versatile. What do we see when looking at the type

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a new and entirely undetected Linux threat dubbed  OrBit , signally a growing trend of malware attacks geared towards the popular operating system.  The malware gets its name from one of the filenames that's utilized to temporarily store the output of executed commands ("/tmp/.orbit"), according to cybersecurity firm Intezer.  "It can be installed either with persistence capabilities or as a volatile implant," security researcher Nicole Fishbein  said . "The malware implements advanced evasion techniques and gains persistence on the machine by hooking key functions, provides the threat actors with remote access capabilities over SSH, harvests credentials, and logs TTY commands."  OrBit is the fourth Linux malware to have come to light in a short span of three months after  BPFDoor ,  Symbiote , and  Syslogk .   The malware also functions a lot like Symbiote in that it's designed to infect all of t

Cisco on Wednesday rolled out patches for  10 security flaws  spanning multiple products, one of which is rated Critical in severity and could be weaponized to conduct absolute path traversal attacks.  The issues, tracked as  CVE-2022-20812 and CVE-2022-20813 , affect Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) and "could allow a remote attacker to overwrite arbitrary files or conduct null byte poisoning attacks on an affected device," the company  said  in an advisory.  CVE-2022-20812 (CVSS score: 9.0), which concerns a case of arbitrary file overwrite in the cluster database API, requires the authenticated, remote attacker to have Administrator read-write privileges on the application so as to be able to mount path traversal attacks as a root user.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has  chosen  the first set of quantum-resistant encryption algorithms that are designed to "withstand the assault of a future quantum computer."  The post-quantum cryptography ( PQC ) technologies include the  CRYSTALS-Kyber  algorithm for general encryption, and  CRYSTALS-Dilithium ,  FALCON , and  SPHINCS+  for digital signatures.   "Three of the selected algorithms are based on a family of math problems called structured lattices, while SPHINCS+ uses hash functions," NIST, which kicked off the standardization process in January 2017,  said  in a statement.  Cryptography, which underpins the security of information in modern computer networks, derives its strength from the difficulty of solving mathematical problems — e.g., factoring large composite integers — using traditional computers.  Quantum computers, should they mature enough, pose a  huge impact  on the current pu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The maintainers of the OpenSSL project have released patches to address a  high-severity bug  in the cryptographic library that could potentially lead to remote code execution under certain scenarios.  The  issue , now assigned the identifier  CVE-2022-2274 , has been described as a case of heap memory corruption with RSA private key operation that was introduced in OpenSSL version 3.0.4 released on June 21, 2022.  First released in 1998, OpenSSL is a general-purpose  cryptography library  that offers open-source implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, enabling users to generate private keys, create certificate signing requests ( CSRs ), install SSL/TLS certificates.   "SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture are affected by this issue," the advisory  noted .

Malicious actors have been observed abusing legitimate adversary simulation software in their attacks in an attempt to stay under the radar and evade detection.  Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said  a  malware sample  uploaded to the VirusTotal database on May 19, 2022, contained a payload associated with Brute Ratel C4, a relatively new sophisticated toolkit "designed to avoid detection by endpoint detection and response (EDR) and antivirus (AV) capabilities."  Authored by an Indian security researcher named  Chetan Nayak , Brute Ratel (BRc4) is analogous to Cobalt Strike and is  described  as a "customized command-and-control center for red team and adversary simulation."   The commercial software was first released in late 2020 and has since gained over 480 licenses across 350 customers. Each license is offered at $2,500 per user for a year, after which it can be renewed for the same duration at the cost of $2,250.  BRc4 is equipped with a wide variety of features,

July may positively disrupt and adrenalize the old-fashioned Dynamic Application Security Scanning (DAST) market, despite the coming holiday season. The pathbreaking innovation comes from ImmuniWeb, a global application security company, well known for, among other things, its free  Community Edition  that processes over 100,000 daily security scans of web and mobile apps.   Today, ImmuniWeb announced that its new product –  Neuron  – is publicly available. This would be another boring press release by a software vendor, but the folks from ImmuniWeb managed to add a secret sauce that you will unlikely be able to resist tasting. The DAST scanning service is flexibly available as a SaaS, and unsurprisingly contains all fashionable features commonly advertised by competitors on the rapidly growing global market, spanning from native CI/CD integrations to advanced configuration of security scanning, pre-programmed or authenticated testing.   But the groundbreaking feature is Neuron's

Military entities located in Bangladesh continue to be at the receiving end of sustained cyberattacks by an advanced persistent threat tracked as Bitter.  "Through malicious document files and intermediate malware stages the threat actors conduct espionage by deploying Remote Access Trojans," cybersecurity firm SECUINFRA  said  in a new write-up published on July 5.  The findings from the Berlin-headquartered company build on a  previous report  from Cisco Talos in May, which disclosed the group's expansion in targeting to strike Bangladeshi government organizations with a backdoor called  ZxxZ .   Bitter, also tracked under the codenames APT-C-08 and T-APT-17, is said to be active  since at least late 2013  and has a track record of targeting China, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia using different tools such as BitterRAT and ArtraDownloader.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators of the Hive ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) scheme have overhauled their file-encrypting software to fully migrate to Rust and adopt a more sophisticated encryption method.  "With its latest variant carrying several major upgrades, Hive also proves it's one of the fastest evolving ransomware families, exemplifying the continuously changing ransomware ecosystem," Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)  said  in a report on Tuesday.  Hive , which was first observed in June 2021, has emerged as one of the most prolific RaaS groups,  accounting  for 17 attacks in the month of May 2022 alone, alongside  Black Basta and Conti .   The shift from GoLang to Rust makes Hive the second ransomware strain after  BlackCat  to be written in the programming language, enabling the malware to gain additional benefits such as memory safety and deeper control over low-level resources as well as make use of a wide range of cryptographic libraries.

Researchers Uncover Malicious NPM Packages Stealing Data from Apps and Web Forms<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/researchers-uncover-malicious-npm.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A widespread software supply chain attack has targeted the NPM package manager at least since December 2021 with rogue modules designed to steal data entered in forms by users on websites that include them.  The coordinated attack, dubbed IconBurst by ReversingLabs, involves no fewer than two dozen NPM packages that include obfuscated JavaScript, which comes with malicious code to harvest sensitive data from forms embedded downstream mobile applications and websites.  "These clearly malicious attacks relied on typo-squatting, a technique in which attackers offer up packages via public repositories with names that are similar to — or common misspellings of — legitimate packages," security researcher Karlo Zanki  said  in a Tuesday report. "Attackers impersonated high-traffic NPM modules like umbrellajs and packages published by ionic.io."   The packages in question, most of which were published in the last months, have been collectively downloaded more than 27,000 t

A pro-China  influence campaign  singled out rare earth mining companies in Australia, Canada, and the U.S. with negative messaging in an unsuccessful attempt to manipulate public discourse to China's benefit.  Targeted firms included Australia's Lynas Rare Earths Ltd, Canada's Appia Rare Earths & Uranium Corp, and the American company USA Rare Earth, threat intelligence firm Mandiant said in a report last week, calling the digital campaign  Dragonbridge .   "It targeted an industry of strategic significance to the PRC, including specifically three commercial entities challenging the  PRC's global market dominance  in that industry," Mandiant  noted .  The goal, the company noted, was to instigate environmental protests against the companies and propagate counter-narratives in response to potential or planned rare earths production activities involving the targets.

Change is a part of life, and nothing stays the same for too long, even with hacking groups, which are at their most dangerous when working in complete silence. The notorious REvil  ransomware  gang, linked to the infamous JBS and Kaseya, has resurfaced three months after the arrest of its members in Russia.  The Russian domestic intelligence service, the FSB, had caught 14 people from the gang. In this apprehension, the 14 members of the gang were found in possession of 426 million roubles, $600,000, 500,000 euros, computer equipment, and 20 luxury cars were brought to justice.  REvil Ransomware Gang- The Context  The financially-motivated cybercriminal threat group Gold Southfield controlled ransomware group known as REvil emerged in 2019 and spread like wildfire after extorting $11 million from the meat-processor JBS.  REvil would incentivize its affiliates to carry out cyberattacks for them by giving a percentage of the ransom pay-outs to those who help with infiltration activitie

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the various measures ransomware actors have taken to obscure their true identity online as well as the hosting location of their web server infrastructure.  "Most ransomware operators use hosting providers outside their country of origin (such as Sweden, Germany, and Singapore) to host their ransomware operations sites," Cisco Talos researcher Paul Eubanks  said . "They use VPS hop-points as a proxy to hide their true location when they connect to their ransomware web infrastructure for remote administration tasks."  Also prominent are the use of the TOR network and DNS proxy registration services to provide an added layer of anonymity for their illegal operations.  But by taking advantage of the threat actors' operational security missteps and other techniques, the cybersecurity firm disclosed last week that it was able to identify TOR hidden services hosted on public IP addresses, some of which are previously unknown in

Update Google Chrome Browser to Patch New Zero-Day Exploit Detected in the Wild<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/update-google-chrome-browser-to-patch.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Monday shipped security updates to address a high-severity zero-day vulnerability in its Chrome web browser that it said is being exploited in the wild.  The shortcoming, tracked as  CVE-2022-2294 , relates to a heap overflow flaw in the  WebRTC  component that provides real-time audio and video communication capabilities in browsers without the need to install plugins or download native apps.  Heap buffer overflows, also referred to as heap overrun or heap smashing, occur when data is overwritten in the  heap area of the memory , leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.   "Heap-based overflows can be used to overwrite function pointers that may be living in memory, pointing it to the attacker's code," MITRE  explains . "When the consequence is arbitrary code execution, this can often be used to subvert any other security service."  Credited with reporting the flaw on July 1, 2022, is Jan Vojtesek from the Avast Thre

The Cyber Police of Ukraine last week disclosed that it apprehended nine members of a criminal gang that embezzled 100 million hryvnias via hundreds of phishing sites that claimed to offer financial assistance to Ukrainian citizens as part of a campaign aimed at capitalizing on the ongoing conflict.  "Criminals created more than 400 phishing links to obtain bank card data of citizens and appropriate money from their accounts," the agency  said  in a press statement last week. "The perpetrators may face up to 15 years behind bars."   The law enforcement operation culminated in the seizure of computer equipment, mobile phones, bank cards as well as the criminal proceeds illicitly obtained through the scheme.  Some of the rogue domains registered by the actors included ross0.yolasite[.]com, foundationua[.]com, ua-compensation[.]buzz, www.bless12[.]store, help-compensation[.]xyz, newsukraine10.yolasite[.]com, and euro24dopomoga0.yolasite[.]com, among others.

Gardeners know that worms are good. Cybersecurity professionals know that worms are  bad . Very bad. In fact, worms are literally the most devasting force for evil known to the computing world. The  MyDoom  worm holds the dubious position of most costly computer malware  ever  – responsible for some  $52 billion  in damage. In second place…  Sobig , another worm.  It turns out, however, that there are exceptions to every rule. Some biological worms are actually  not welcome  in most gardens. And some cyber worms, it seems, can use their powers for good …   Meet Hopper, The Good Worm  Detection tools are not good at  catching non-exploit-based propagation , which is what worms do best. Most cybersecurity solutions are less resilient to worm attack methods like token impersonation and others that take advantage of deficient internal configurations - PAM, segmentation, insecure credential storage, and more.  So, what better way to beat a stealthy worm than with … another stealthy worm?

The admission that some China-based employees can access information from U.S. users came in a letter sent to nine senators, which further noted that the procedure requires the individuals to clear numerous internal security protocols.  The contents of the letter, first  reported  by The New York Times, shares more details about TikTok's plans to address data security concerns through a multi-pronged initiative codenamed "Project Texas."

Microsoft Warns About Evolving Capabilities of Toll Fraud Android Malware Apps<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/microsoft-warns-about-evolving.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has detailed the evolving capabilities of toll fraud malware apps on Android, pointing out its "complex multi-step attack flow" and an improved mechanism to evade security analysis.  Toll fraud belongs to a category of billing fraud wherein malicious mobile applications come with hidden subscription fees, roping in unsuspecting users to premium content without their knowledge or consent.  It's also different from other  fleeceware threats  in that the malicious functions are only carried out when a compromised device is connected to one of its target network operators.  "It also, by default, uses cellular connection for its activities and forces devices to connect to the mobile network even if a Wi-Fi connection is available," Dimitrios Valsamaras and Sang Shin Jung of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team  said  in an exhaustive analysis.  "Once the connection to a target network is confirmed, it stealthily initiates a fraudulent subscription

Google Improves Its Password Manager to Boost Security Across All Platforms<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/google-improves-its-password-manager-to.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Thursday announced a slew of improvements to its  password manager  service aimed at creating a more consistent look and feel across different platforms.  Central to the changes is a "simplified and unified management experience that's the same in Chrome and Android settings," Ali Sarraf, Google Chrome product manager,  said  in a blog post.   The updates are also expected to automatically group multiple passwords for the same sites as well as introduce an option to manually add passwords. Although Google appears to be not ready yet to make Password Manager as a standalone app, users on Android can now add a shortcut to it on the homescreen.   In a related change on iOS, should users opt for Chrome as the  default autofill provider , Password Manager now comes with the ability to generate unique, strong passwords.   The built-in Password Checkup feature on Android is receiving an upgrade of its own too. Beyond checking for hacked credentials, it can further hig

Dubbed  SessionManager , the malicious tool masquerades as a module for Internet Information Services ( IIS ), a web server software for Windows systems, after exploiting one of the ProxyLogon flaws within Exchange servers.   Targets included 24 distinct NGOs, government, military, and industrial organizations spanning Africa, South America, Asia, Europe, Russia and the Middle East. A total of 34 servers have been compromised by a SessionManager variant to date.   This is far from the first time the technique has been  observed in real-world attacks .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Fixing indirect vulnerabilities is one of those complex, tedious and, quite frankly, boring tasks that no one really wants to touch. No one except for  Debricked , it seems. Sure, there are lots of ways to do it manually, but can it be done automatically with minimal risk of breaking changes? The Debricked team decided to find out.   A forest full of fragile trees  So, where do you even start?  Firstly, there needs to be a way to fix the vulnerability, which, for indirect dependencies, is no walk in the park. Secondly, it needs to be done in a safe way, or, without anything breaking.   You see, indirect dependencies are introduced deep down the dependency tree and it's very tricky to get to the exact version you want. As Debricked's Head of R&D once put it, " You are turning the knobs by playing around with your direct dependencies and praying to Torvalds that the correct indirect packages are resolved. When Torvalds is in your favour, you have to sacrifice some cloud

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Amazon, in December 2021, patched a high severity vulnerability affecting its  Photos app  for Android that could have been exploited to steal a user's access tokens.  "The Amazon access token is used to authenticate the user across multiple Amazon APIs, some of which contain personal data such as full name, email, and address," Checkmarx researchers João Morais and Pedro Umbelino  said .
