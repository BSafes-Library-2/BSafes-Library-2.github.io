WASHINGTON, November 15, 2023—The Federal Communications Commission today adopted new rules to protect consumers against scams that aim to commandeer their cell phone accounts. The rules will help protect consumers from scammers who target data and personal information by covertly swapping SIM cards to a new device or porting phone numbers to a new carrier without ever gaining physical control of a consumer’s phone. These updated rules will help protect consumers from SIM swapping scams and port-out fraud while maintaining their well-established freedom to pick their preferred device and provider.

At the same time, irresponsible use could exacerbate societal harms such as fraud, discrimination, bias, and disinformation; displace and disempower workers; stifle competition; and pose risks to national security.  Harnessing AI for good and realizing its myriad benefits requires mitigating its substantial risks.  This endeavor demands a society-wide effort that includes government, the private sector, academia, and civil society.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Intelligence Enterprise Homeland Threat Assessment reflects the insights from across the Department, the Intelligence Community, and other critical homeland security stakeholders. It focuses on the most direct, pressing threats to our Homeland during the next year and is organized into four sections. We organized this assessment around the Department’s missions that most closely align or apply to these threats—public safety, border and immigration, critical infrastructure, and economic security. As such, many of the threat actors and their efforts cut across mission areas and interact in complex and, at times, reinforcing ways.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Akira is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group that started operations in March 2023. Since its discovery, the group has claimed over 60 victims, which have typically ranged in the small- to medium-size business scale. Akira has garnered attention for a couple of reasons, such as their retro 1980s-themed website (see figure below) and the considerable demands for ransom payments ranging from $200,000 to $4 million. Akira has been observed obtaining initial malware delivery through several methods, such as leveraging compromised credentials and exploiting weaknesses in virtual private networks (VPN), typically where multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not being used. Like many ransomware groups, they employed the double-extortion technique against their victims by exfiltrating data prior to encryption. It is also believed that the group may contain some affiliation with Conti due to observed overlap in their code and cryptocurrency wallets. The group has targeted multiple sectors, including finance, real estate, manufacturing, and healthcare.

Rhysida is a new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group that has emerged since May 2023. The group drops an eponymous ransomware via phishing attacks and Cobalt Strike to breach targets’ networks and deploy their payloads. The group threatens to publicly distribute the exfiltrated data if the ransom is not paid. Rhysida is still in early stages of development, as indicated by the lack of advanced features and the program name Rhysida-0.1. The ransomware also leaves PDF notes on the affected folders, instructing the victims to contact the group via their portal and pay in Bitcoin. Its victims are distributed throughout several countries across Western Europe, North and South America, and Australia. They primarily attack education, government, manufacturing, and technology and managed service provider sectors;  however, there has been recent attacks against the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) sector.

The FBI warns of criminal actors posing as legitimate NFT developers in financial fraud schemes targeting active users within the NFT community. Criminals either gain direct access to NFT developer social media accounts or create almost identical accounts to promote new NFT releases. Fraudulent posts often aim to create a sense of urgency, using phrases like "limited supply," and refer to the promotion as a "surprise" or previously unannounced mint. Links provided in these announcements are phishing links directing victims to a spoofed website that appears to be a legitimate extension of a particular NFT project. The spoofed websites invite victims to connect their cryptocurrency wallets and purchase the NFT. The victims unknowingly connect their cryptocurrency wallets to a drainer smart contract, resulting in the transfer of cryptocurrency and NFTs to wallets operated by criminals. Contents stolen from victims' wallets are often processed through a series of cryptocurrency mixers and exchanges to obfuscate the path and final destination of the stolen NFTs.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Technology and humanity are intertwined. Technology itself does not have a value system; rather it carries the values of its owners and operators. Cyberspace is composed not only of technology and protocols, but also people. People are an integral part of cyberspace, both in creating and using it. In less than a generation, technology has transformed our daily lives – among other things, we pay bills, connect with families and friends, build businesses, and build communities. We rely on cyberspace for our national security, economic development, and innovation. More than any other domain – air, space, sea, or land – people conceived of and created cyberspace and will continue to improve it. The Biden-Harris Administration’s 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy establishes an affirmative, valuesdriven vision for a secure and resilient cyberspace that enables us to achieve our collective aspirations.  To achieve a vision aligned with our values, we must ensure that people are appropriately equipped.  This National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy provides a critical element of the President’s approach to securing cyberspace.

Since January 2020, affiliates using LockBit have attacked organizations of varying sizes across an array of critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services, food and agriculture, education, energy, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools and infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This variance in observed ransomware TTPs presents a notable challenge for organizations working to maintain network security and protect against a ransomware threat

North Korea) state-sponsored cyber actors to enable computer network exploitation (CNE) globally against individuals employed by research centers and think tanks, academic institutions, and news media organizations. These North Korean cyber actors are known to conduct spearphishing campaigns posing as real journalists, academics, or other individuals with credible links to North Korean policy circles. The DPRK employs social engineering to collect intelligence on geopolitical events, foreign policy strategies, and diplomatic efforts affecting its interests by gaining illicit access to the private documents, research, and communications of their targets.

The AHA agrees with OCR that a “positive, trusting relationship between individuals and their health care providers is essential to an individual’s health and well-being.”1 The proposed rule will enhance provider-patient relationships by providing heightened privacy protections for information about care that is lawful under the circumstances in which it is provided, but may nonetheless get swept up in criminal, civil or administrative investigations.
