The term ‘prompt injection’ was coined in 2022 to describe a new class of application vulnerability in genAI applications. Prompt injection is where developers concatenate their own instructions with untrusted content in a single prompt, and then treat the model’s response as if there were a robust boundary between ‘what the app asked for’ and anything in the untrusted content.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is warning the public about a growing and evolving online threat group known as The Com, short for The Community. The Com is a primarily English speaking, international, online ecosystem comprised of multiple interconnected networks whose members, many of whom are minors, engage in a variety of criminal violations. The FBI estimates thousands of individuals identify as current or recent members of The Com with varying levels of associated activity. Criminal activity conducted by members of The Com includes, but is not limited to, swatting1/hoax threats, extortion/sextortion of minors, production and distribution of child sexual abuse material, violent crime, and various types of cyber crimes. The latter category is broad and includes distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, subscriber identity module (SIM) swapping2, ransomware, intellectual property theft, extortion, cryptocurrency theft, and money laundering. The motivations behind the criminal activity vary, but often fall within one of the following: financial gain, retaliation, ideology, sexual gratification, and notoriety.

CISA is aware of public reporting regarding potential unauthorized access to a legacy Oracle cloud environment. While the scope and impact remains unconfirmed, the nature of the reported activity presents potential risk to organizations and individuals, particularly where credential material may be exposed, reused across separate, unaffiliated systems, or embedded (i.e., hardcoded into scripts, applications, infrastructure templates, or automation tools). When credential material is embedded, it is difficult to discover and can enable long-term unauthorized access if exposed.

Fast Flux: A National Security Threat <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Apr/02/2003681172/-1/-1/0/CSA-FAST-FLUX.PDF"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
Many networks have a gap in their defenses for detecting and blocking a malicious
technique known as “fast flux.” This technique poses a significant threat to national
security, enabling malicious cyber actors to consistently evade detection. Malicious
cyber actors, including cybercriminals and nation-state actors, use fast flux to obfuscate
the locations of malicious servers by rapidly changing Domain Name System (DNS)
records. Additionally, they can create resilient, highly available command and control
(C2) infrastructure, concealing their subsequent malicious operations. This resilient and
fast changing infrastructure makes tracking and blocking malicious activities that use
fast flux more difficult.
