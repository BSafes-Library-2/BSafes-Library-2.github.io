  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Threat Actors Exploiting Citrix CVE-2023-3519 to Implant Webshells, to warn organizations about threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-3519, an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting NetScaler (formerly Citrix) Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway. In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day to drop a webshell on a critical infrastructure organization’s NetScaler ADC appliance. The webshell enabled the actors to perform discovery on the victim’s active directory (AD) and collect and exfiltrate AD data. The actors attempted to move laterally to a domain controller but network-segmentation controls for the appliance blocked movement.

In 2022, LockBit was the most deployed ransomware variant across the world and continues to be prolific in 2023. Since January 2020, affiliates using LockBit have attacked organizations of varying sizes across an array of critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services, food and agriculture, education, energy, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools and infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This variance in observed ransomware TTPs presents a notable challenge for organizations working to maintain network security and protect against a ransomware threat

At CISA, we are working with partners to take every possible step to reduce the prevalence and impact of ransomware attacks. We recently announced an important initiative to help organizations more quickly fix vulnerabilities that are targeted by ransomware actors. Today, we’re excited to announce a related effort that is already showing impact in actually reducing the harm from ransomware intrusions: our Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative. Like our work to reduce the prevalence of vulnerabilities, this effort is coordinated as part of our interagency Joint Ransomware Task Force.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) (hereafter referred to as the “authoring organizations”) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn network defenders about malicious use of legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software. In October 2022, CISA identified a widespread cyber campaign involving the malicious use of legitimate RMM software. Specifically, cyber criminal actors sent phishing emails that led to the download of legitimate RMM software—ScreenConnect (now ConnectWise Control) and AnyDesk—which the actors used in a refund scam to steal money from victim bank accounts.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
LockBit 3.0 is the newest version of the LockBit ransomware that was first discovered in September 2019.  The ransomware family has a history of using the Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and typically targets organizations that could pay higher ransoms. Historically, this ransomware employs a double extortion technique where sensitive data is encrypted and exfiltrated. The actor requests payment to decrypt data and threatens to leak the sensitive data if the payment is not made. With the new release, it appears that the ransomware is using a triple extortion model where the affected victim may also be asked to purchase their sensitive information. Since its appearance, HC3 is aware of LockBit 3.0 attacks against the Healthcare and Public Healthcare (HPH) sector. Due to the historical nature of ransomware victimizing the healthcare community, LockBit 3.0 should be considered a threat to the HPH sector.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Modern society relies heavily on software-based automation, implicitly trusting developers to write software that operates in the expected way and cannot be compromised for malicious purposes. While developers often perform rigorous testing to prepare the logic in software for surprising conditions, exploitable software vulnerabilities are still frequently based on memory issues. Examples include overflowing a memory buffer and leveraging issues with how software allocates and deallocates memory. Microsoft® revealed at a conference in 2019 that from 2006 to 2018 70 percent of their vulnerabilities were due to memory safety issues. [1] Google® also found a similar percentage of memory safety vulnerabilities over several years in Chrome®. [2] Malicious cyber actors can exploit these vulnerabilities for remote code execution or other adverse effects, which can often compromise a device and be the first step in large-scale network intrusions.

Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute (SEI), in collaboration with CISA, created the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) system in 2019 to provide the cyber community a vulnerability analysis methodology that accounts for a vulnerability's exploitation status, impacts to safety, and prevalence of the affected product in a singular system. CISA worked with SEI in 2020 to develop its own customized SSVC decision tree to examine vulnerabilities relevant to the United States government (USG), as well as state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments, and critical infrastructure entities. Implementing SSVC has allowed CISA to better prioritize its vulnerability response and vulnerability messaging to the public.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As recently as October 2022, the FBI observed several instances nationwide of scammers conducting computer-technical support scams, where criminals pose as service representatives of a company's technical or computer repair service and contact victims through email or by telephone about a highly priced, soon-to-renew subscription. Scammers request victims contact the scammers at a provided telephone number or email to cancel the renewal and receive a varying refund amount. After the victims contact the scammers, they attempt to obtain personal and banking information that is then used to conduct unauthorized wire transfers of funds held within the targeted victim's accounts. Targeted victims generally fall within the elderly population.

Our adversaries are in our networks, exfiltrating our data, and exploiting the Department’s users.  The rapid growth of these offensive threats emphasizes the need for the Department of Defense (DoD) to adapt and significantly improve our deterrence strategies and cybersecurity implementations. Defending DoD networks with high-powered and ever-more sophisticated perimeter defenses is no longer sufficient for achieving cyber resiliency and securing our information enterprise that spans geographic borders, interfaces with external partners, and support to millions of authorized users, many of which now require access to DoD networks outside traditional boundaries, such as work from home. To meet these challenges, the DoD requires an enhanced cybersecurity framework built upon Zero Trust principles that must be adopted across the Department, enterprise-wide, as quickly as possible as described within this document.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The FBI is providing information concerning ongoing hack-and-leak cyber operations conducted by Iranian cyber group Emennet Pasargad. According to FBI information, since at least 2020, Emennet targeted entities primarily in Israel with cyber-enabled information operations that included an initial intrusion, theft and subsequent leak of data, followed by amplification through social media and online forums, and in some cases the deployment of destructive encryption malware. To avoid attribution, Emennet executed false-flag campaigns under the guise of multiple personas like hacktivist or cyber-criminal groups. Although Emennet’s latest attacks have primarily targeted Israel, the FBI judges these techniques may be used to target US entities as seen during Emennet’s cyber-enabled information operation that targeted the 2020 US Presidential election1. Within the past year, the FBI has identified a destructive cyber attack against a US organization – indicating the group remains a cyber threat to the United States.

From November 2021 through January 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) responded to advanced persistent threat (APT) activity on a Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organization’s enterprise network. During incident response activities, CISA uncovered that likely multiple APT groups compromised the organization’s network, and some APT actors had long-term access to the environment. APT actors used an open-source toolkit called Impacket to gain their foothold within the environment and further compromise the network, and also used a custom data exfiltration tool, CovalentStealer, to steal the victim’s sensitive data.

Robotext scams are on the rise and may even be passing robocalls as a tool for con artists.  

Like robocalls, texts can be spoofed to mask the originating number and make it appear that the text is coming from a number you’re more likely to trust. Spoofers may opt for a local number, or impersonate a government agency, such as the IRS, or a company you’re familiar with. Scammers use these methods to get you to respond to a text.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybercriminals are targeting victims by sending text messages with what appear to be bank fraud alerts asking if the customer initiated an instant money transfer using digital payment applications (apps). Once the victim responds to the alert, the cybercriminal then calls from a number which appears to match the financial institution's legitimate 1-800 support number. Under the pretext of reversing the fake money transfer, victims are swindled into sending payment to bank accounts under the control of the cyber actors.
