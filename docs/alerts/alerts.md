Today, the Biden-Harris Administration will issue an Executive Order to bolster the security of the nation’s ports, alongside a series of additional actions that will strengthen maritime cybersecurity, fortify our supply chains and strengthen the United States industrial base. The Administration will also announce its intent to bring domestic onshore manufacturing capacity back to America to provide safe, secure cranes to U.S. ports – thanks to an over $20 billion investment in U.S. port infrastructure under President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda. Today’s actions are clear examples of the President’s work to invest in America, secure the country’s supply chains, and strengthen the cybersecurity of our nation’s critical infrastructure against 21st century threats – priorities his Administration has focused on relentlessly since taking office.

With the publication of the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NOS), Secretary Austin charted the Defense Department's way forward through this decisive decade. Increasingly coercive actions taken by the People's Republic of China demonstrates its intent to reshape the lndo-Pacific region and broader international system to fit its authoritarian preferences, and the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine underscores the acute threat it poses. These threats, along with transboundary challenges like COVID-19, demonstrate the imperative for increased and improved defense capabilities for both the United States and our allies and partners.
