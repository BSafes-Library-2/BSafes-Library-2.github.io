Fast Flux: A National Security Threat <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Apr/02/2003681172/-1/-1/0/CSA-FAST-FLUX.PDF"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
Many networks have a gap in their defenses for detecting and blocking a malicious
technique known as “fast flux.” This technique poses a significant threat to national
security, enabling malicious cyber actors to consistently evade detection. Malicious
cyber actors, including cybercriminals and nation-state actors, use fast flux to obfuscate
the locations of malicious servers by rapidly changing Domain Name System (DNS)
records. Additionally, they can create resilient, highly available command and control
(C2) infrastructure, concealing their subsequent malicious operations. This resilient and
fast changing infrastructure makes tracking and blocking malicious activities that use
fast flux more difficult.
