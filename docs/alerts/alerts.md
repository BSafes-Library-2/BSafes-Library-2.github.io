Online advertising is a key and growing component of the global digital economy. According to an industry review, the UK is expected to spend a projected £3.7 billion on advertising in 2024, and roughly three quarters of that will be digital content. This makes digital advertising a huge contributor to the UK economy, but public and commercial trust in the cyber security of the sector is essential if this is to remain the case.

Post-Quantum Cryptography <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers – machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere.  The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.

Often, these organizations and their employees are targeted by state-sponsored threat actors who seek to undermine democratic values and interests. Regularly conducted as a type of transnational repression (also referred to as digital transnational repression), state-sponsored actors compromise organizational or personal devices and networks to intimidate, silence, coerce, harass, or harm civil society organizations and individuals.

Unlike romance scams involving investment-confidence schemes, commonly referred to as pig-butchering, where victims are convinced to transfer large amounts of money over time, the so called "free" verification schemes involve recurring and costly monthly subscription fees. Additionally, fraudsters collect the information entered by victims at registrations (e.g., emails, phone numbers, and credit card information) and use it to commit further fraudulent activity such as identity theft or selling the information on the dark web.

The Directive was initially issued to federal agencies on April 2nd based upon currently available threat information and limited applicability of relevant actions, which are predicated on notification of exposed credentials by Microsoft. This Directive requires agencies to analyze potentially affected emails, reset any compromised credentials, and take additional steps to secure privileged Microsoft Azure accounts.

With the publication of the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NOS), Secretary Austin charted the Defense Department's way forward through this decisive decade. Increasingly coercive actions taken by the People's Republic of China demonstrates its intent to reshape the lndo-Pacific region and broader international system to fit its authoritarian preferences, and the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine underscores the acute threat it poses. These threats, along with transboundary challenges like COVID-19, demonstrate the imperative for increased and improved defense capabilities for both the United States and our allies and partners.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Voice cloning technology is becoming increasing sophisticated due to improving text-to-speech AI. The technology offers promise, including medical assistance for people who may have lost their voices due to accident or illness. It also poses significant risk: families and small businesses can be targeted with fraudulent extortion scams; creative professionals, such as voice artists, can have their voices appropriated in ways that threaten their livelihoods and deceive the public.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Adversaries can deliberately confuse or even “poison” artificial intelligence (AI) systems to make them malfunction — and there’s no foolproof defense that their developers can employ. Computer scientists from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and their collaborators identify these and other vulnerabilities of AI and machine learning (ML) in a new publication.
