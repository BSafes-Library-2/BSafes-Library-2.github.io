<details>
CISA has observed widespread and active exploitation of vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure solutions, hereafter referred to as “affected products.” Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities in these affected products allows a malicious threat actor to move laterally, perform data exfiltration, and establish persistent system access, resulting in full compromise of target information systems.

With the publication of the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NOS), Secretary Austin charted the Defense Department's way forward through this decisive decade. Increasingly coercive actions taken by the People's Republic of China demonstrates its intent to reshape the lndo-Pacific region and broader international system to fit its authoritarian preferences, and the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine underscores the acute threat it poses. These threats, along with transboundary challenges like COVID-19, demonstrate the imperative for increased and improved defense capabilities for both the United States and our allies and partners.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Voice cloning technology is becoming increasing sophisticated due to improving text-to-speech AI. The technology offers promise, including medical assistance for people who may have lost their voices due to accident or illness. It also poses significant risk: families and small businesses can be targeted with fraudulent extortion scams; creative professionals, such as voice artists, can have their voices appropriated in ways that threaten their livelihoods and deceive the public.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Adversaries can deliberately confuse or even “poison” artificial intelligence (AI) systems to make them malfunction — and there’s no foolproof defense that their developers can employ. Computer scientists from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and their collaborators identify these and other vulnerabilities of AI and machine learning (ML) in a new publication.
