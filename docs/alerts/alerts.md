The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) helps the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) critical infrastructure sector prepare for and respond to cyber threats, adapt to the evolving threat landscape, and build a more resilient sector. As outlined in the HHS Healthcare Sector Cybersecurity concept paper, HHS is publishing these voluntary healthcare specifc Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) to help healthcare organizations prioritize implementation of high-impact cybersecurity practices. The HPH CPGs are designed to better protect the healthcare sector from cyberattacks, improve response when events occur, and minimize residual risk. HPH CPGs include both essential goals to outline minimum foundational practices for cybersecurity performance and enhanced goals to encourage adoption of more advanced practices.

With the publication of the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NOS), Secretary Austin charted the Defense Department's way forward through this decisive decade. Increasingly coercive actions taken by the People's Republic of China demonstrates its intent to reshape the lndo-Pacific region and broader international system to fit its authoritarian preferences, and the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine underscores the acute threat it poses. These threats, along with transboundary challenges like COVID-19, demonstrate the imperative for increased and improved defense capabilities for both the United States and our allies and partners.

Voice cloning technology is becoming increasing sophisticated due to improving text-to-speech AI. The technology offers promise, including medical assistance for people who may have lost their voices due to accident or illness. It also poses significant risk: families and small businesses can be targeted with fraudulent extortion scams; creative professionals, such as voice artists, can have their voices appropriated in ways that threaten their livelihoods and deceive the public.
