  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Rhysida is a new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group that has emerged since May 2023. The group drops an eponymous ransomware via phishing attacks and Cobalt Strike to breach targets’ networks and deploy their payloads. The group threatens to publicly distribute the exfiltrated data if the ransom is not paid. Rhysida is still in early stages of development, as indicated by the lack of advanced features and the program name Rhysida-0.1. The ransomware also leaves PDF notes on the affected folders, instructing the victims to contact the group via their portal and pay in Bitcoin. Its victims are distributed throughout several countries across Western Europe, North and South America, and Australia. They primarily attack education, government, manufacturing, and technology and managed service provider sectors;  however, there has been recent attacks against the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) sector.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The FBI warns of criminal actors posing as legitimate NFT developers in financial fraud schemes targeting active users within the NFT community. Criminals either gain direct access to NFT developer social media accounts or create almost identical accounts to promote new NFT releases. Fraudulent posts often aim to create a sense of urgency, using phrases like "limited supply," and refer to the promotion as a "surprise" or previously unannounced mint. Links provided in these announcements are phishing links directing victims to a spoofed website that appears to be a legitimate extension of a particular NFT project. The spoofed websites invite victims to connect their cryptocurrency wallets and purchase the NFT. The victims unknowingly connect their cryptocurrency wallets to a drainer smart contract, resulting in the transfer of cryptocurrency and NFTs to wallets operated by criminals. Contents stolen from victims' wallets are often processed through a series of cryptocurrency mixers and exchanges to obfuscate the path and final destination of the stolen NFTs.

Our nation is at a moment of opportunity. The 2023 U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy outlines a new vision for cybersecurity, a vision grounded in collaboration, in innovation, and in accountability. Now is the moment where our country has a choice: to invest in a future where collaboration is a default rather than an exception; where innovation in defense and resilience dramatically outpaces that of those seeking to do us harm; and where the burden of cybersecurity is allocated toward those who are most able to bear it. We must be clear-eyed about the future we seek, one in which damaging cyber intrusions are a shocking anomaly, in which organizations are secure and resilient, in which technology products are safe and secure by design and default. This is a shared journey and a shared challenge, and CISA, as America’s cyber defense agency, is privileged to serve a foundational role in the global cybersecurity community as we achieve measurable progress to our shared end state.

Technology and humanity are intertwined. Technology itself does not have a value system; rather it carries the values of its owners and operators. Cyberspace is composed not only of technology and protocols, but also people. People are an integral part of cyberspace, both in creating and using it. In less than a generation, technology has transformed our daily lives – among other things, we pay bills, connect with families and friends, build businesses, and build communities. We rely on cyberspace for our national security, economic development, and innovation. More than any other domain – air, space, sea, or land – people conceived of and created cyberspace and will continue to improve it. The Biden-Harris Administration’s 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy establishes an affirmative, valuesdriven vision for a secure and resilient cyberspace that enables us to achieve our collective aspirations.  To achieve a vision aligned with our values, we must ensure that people are appropriately equipped.  This National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy provides a critical element of the President’s approach to securing cyberspace.

In 2022, LockBit was the most deployed ransomware variant across the world and continues to be prolific in 2023. Since January 2020, affiliates using LockBit have attacked organizations of varying sizes across an array of critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services, food and agriculture, education, energy, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools and infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This variance in observed ransomware TTPs presents a notable challenge for organizations working to maintain network security and protect against a ransomware threat

At CISA, we are working with partners to take every possible step to reduce the prevalence and impact of ransomware attacks. We recently announced an important initiative to help organizations more quickly fix vulnerabilities that are targeted by ransomware actors. Today, we’re excited to announce a related effort that is already showing impact in actually reducing the harm from ransomware intrusions: our Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative. Like our work to reduce the prevalence of vulnerabilities, this effort is coordinated as part of our interagency Joint Ransomware Task Force.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) (hereafter referred to as the “authoring organizations”) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn network defenders about malicious use of legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software. In October 2022, CISA identified a widespread cyber campaign involving the malicious use of legitimate RMM software. Specifically, cyber criminal actors sent phishing emails that led to the download of legitimate RMM software—ScreenConnect (now ConnectWise Control) and AnyDesk—which the actors used in a refund scam to steal money from victim bank accounts.
