<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coordinated law enforcement operation across 25 African countries has led to the arrest of 14 suspected cybercriminals, INTERPOL&nbsp; announced &nbsp;Friday. The exercise, conducted in partnership with AFRIPOL, enabled investigators to identify 20,674 cyber networks that were linked to financial losses of more than $40 million. "The four-month Africa Cyber Surge II operation was launched in April 2023 and focused on identifying cybercriminals and compromised infrastructure," the agency said. As part of the operation, three suspects were arrested in Cameroon in connection with an online scam involving the fraudulent sale of works of art worth $850,000. Another suspect was arrested in Nigeria for defrauding a Gambian victim. Also arrested were two money mules linked to scams initiated through messaging platforms. The cyber networks comprised 3,786 command-and-control (C2) servers, 14,134 victim IP addresses tied to data stealer infections, 1,415 phishing links and domains, 939

Cybercriminals Abusing Cloudflare R2 for Hosting Phishing Pages, Experts Warn<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/cybercriminals-abusing-cloudflare-r2.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors' use of Cloudflare R2 to host phishing pages has witnessed a 61-fold increase over the past six months. "The majority of the phishing campaigns target Microsoft login credentials, although there are some pages targeting Adobe, Dropbox, and other cloud apps," Netskope security researcher Jan Michael&nbsp; said . Cloudflare R2 , analogous to Amazon Web Service S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage, is a data storage service for the cloud. The development comes as the total number of cloud apps from which malware downloads originate has&nbsp; increased to 167 , with Microsoft OneDrive, Squarespace, GitHub, SharePoint, and Weebly taking the top five spots. The phishing campaigns identified by Netskope not only abuse Cloudflare R2 to distribute static phishing pages, but also leverage the company's&nbsp; Turnstile &nbsp;offering, a CAPTCHA replacement, to place such pages behind anti-bot barriers to evade detection. In doing so, it prevents online scanners like

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind the Monti ransomware have resurfaced after a two-month break with a new Linux version of the encryptor in its attacks targeting government and legal sectors. Monti&nbsp; emerged &nbsp;in June 2022, weeks after the Conti ransomware group shut down its operations, deliberately imitating the tactics and tools associated with the latter, including its leaked source code. Not anymore. The new version, per Trend Micro, is a departure of sorts, exhibiting significant changes from its other Linux-based predecessors. "Unlike the earlier variant, which is primarily based on the leaked Conti source code, this new version employs a different encryptor with additional distinct behaviors," Trend Micro researchers Nathaniel Morales and Joshua Paul Ignacio&nbsp; said . A&nbsp; BinDiff analysis &nbsp;has revealed that while the older iterations had a 99% similarity rate with Conti, the latest version has only a 29% similarity rate, suggesting an overhaul.

Interpol has announced the takedown of a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform called 16Shop, in addition to the arrests of three individuals in Indonesia and Japan. 16Shop specialized in the sales of phishing kits that other cybercriminals can purchase to mount phishing attacks on a large scale, ultimately facilitating the theft of credentials and payment details from users of popular services such as Apple, PayPal, American Express, Amazon, and Cash App, among others. "Victims typically receive an email with a pdf file or link that redirects to a site requesting the victims' credit card or other personally identifiable information," Interpol&nbsp; said . "This information is then stolen and used to extract money from the victims." No less than 70,000 users across 43 countries are estimated to have been compromised via services offered on 16Shop.

Cybercriminals Renting WikiLoader to Target Italian Organizations with Banking Trojan<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/cybercriminals-renting-wikiloader-to.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Organizations in Italy are the target of a new phishing campaign that leverages a new strain of malware called&nbsp; WikiLoader &nbsp;with an ultimate aim to install a banking trojan, stealer, and spyware referred to as&nbsp; Ursnif &nbsp;(aka Gozi). "It is a sophisticated downloader with the objective of installing a second malware payload," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. "The malware uses multiple mechanisms to evade detection and was likely developed as a malware that can be rented out to select cybercriminal threat actors." WikiLoader is so named due to the malware making a request to Wikipedia and checking that the response has the string "The Free." The enterprise security firm said it first detected the malware in the wild on December 27, 2022, in connection with an intrusion set mounted by a threat actor it tracks as&nbsp; TA544 , which is also known as Bamboo Spider and Zeus Panda. The campaigns are centered around the use of emails containing either Micro

Tax-paying individuals in Mexico and Chile have been targeted by a Mexico-based cybercrime group that goes by the name&nbsp; Fenix &nbsp;to breach targeted networks and steal valuable data. A key hallmark of the operation entails cloning official portals of the Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT) in Mexico and the Servicio de Impuestos Internos (SII) in Chile and redirecting potential victims to those sites.&nbsp; "These fake websites prompt users to download a supposed security tool, claiming it will enhance their portal navigation safety," Metabase Q security researchers Gerardo Corona and Julio Vidal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a recent analysis. "However, unbeknownst to the victims, this download actually installs the initial stage of malware, ultimately enabling the theft of sensitive information such as credentials." The goal of Fenix, according to the Latin America-focused cybersecurity firm, is to act as an initial access broker and get a foothold into different companies in t

On April 5, 2023, the FBI and Dutch National Police&nbsp; announced the takedown of Genesis Market , one of the largest dark web marketplaces. The operation, dubbed "Operation Cookie Monster," resulted in the arrest of 119 people and the seizure of over $1M in cryptocurrency. You can read the FBI's warrant&nbsp; here &nbsp;for details specific to this case. In light of these events, I'd like to discuss how OSINT can assist with dark web investigations. The Dark Web's anonymity attracts a variety of users, from whistleblowers and political activists to cybercriminals and terrorists. There are several techniques that can be used to try and identify the individuals behind these sites and personas. Technical Vulnerabilities While not considered OSINT, there have been instances when technical vulnerabilities have existed in the technology used to host dark websites. These vulnerabilities may exist in the software itself or be due to misconfigurations, but they can sometimes revea

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The financially motivated threat actor known as FIN8 has been observed using a "revamped" version of a backdoor called&nbsp; Sardonic &nbsp;to deliver the&nbsp; BlackCat ransomware . According to the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, the development is an attempt on the part of the e-crime group to diversify its focus and maximize profits from infected entities. The intrusion attempt took place in December 2022. FIN8 is being tracked by the cybersecurity company under the name Syssphinx. Known to be active since at least 2016, the adversary was originally attributed to attacks targeting point-of-sale (PoS) systems using malware such as PUNCHTRACK and BADHATCH. The group resurfaced after more than a year in March 2021 with an updated version of BADHATCH, following it up with a completely new bespoke implant called Sardonic , which was disclosed by Bitdefender in August 2021.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are actively exploiting a recently disclosed critical security flaw in the WooCommerce Payments WordPress plugin as part of a massive targeted campaign. The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-28121 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), is a case of authentication bypass that enables unauthenticated attackers to impersonate arbitrary users and perform some actions as the impersonated user, including an administrator, potentially leading to site takeover. "Large-scale attacks against the vulnerability, assigned CVE-2023-28121, began on Thursday, July 14, 2023 and continued over the weekend, peaking at 1.3 million attacks against 157,000 sites on Saturday, July 16, 2023," Wordfence security researcher Ram Gall&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday post. Versions 4.8.0 through 5.6.1 of WooCommerce Payments are vulnerable. The plugin is installed on over 600,000 sites.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft Word documents exploiting known remote code execution flaws are being used as phishing lures to drop malware called&nbsp; LokiBot &nbsp;on compromised systems. "LokiBot, also known as Loki PWS, has been a well-known information-stealing Trojan active since 2015," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . "It primarily targets Windows systems and aims to gather sensitive information from infected machines." The cybersecurity company, which spotted the campaign in May 2023, said the attacks take advantage of&nbsp; CVE-2021-40444 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2022-30190 &nbsp;(aka Follina) to achieve code execution. The Word file that weaponizes CVE-2021-40444 contains an external GoFile link embedded within an XML file that leads to the download of an HTML file, which exploits Follina to download a next-stage payload, an injector module written in Visual Basic that decrypts and launches LokiBot.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
With generative artificial intelligence (AI) becoming all the rage these days, it's perhaps not surprising that the technology has been repurposed by malicious actors to their own advantage, enabling avenues for accelerated cybercrime. According to findings from SlashNext, a new generative AI cybercrime tool called&nbsp; WormGPT &nbsp;has been advertised on underground forums as a way for adversaries to launch sophisticated phishing and business email compromise ( BEC ) attacks. "This tool presents itself as a blackhat alternative to GPT models, designed specifically for malicious activities," security researcher Daniel Kelley&nbsp; said . "Cybercriminals can use such technology to automate the creation of highly convincing fake emails, personalized to the recipient, thus increasing the chances of success for the attack." The author of the software has described it as the "biggest enemy of the well-known ChatGPT" that "lets you do all sorts of illegal stuff.

Hackers Steal $20 Million by Exploiting Flaw in Revolut's Payment Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/hackers-steal-20-million-by-exploiting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors exploited an unknown flaw in Revolut's payment systems to steal more than $20 million of the company's funds in early 2022. The development was&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by the Financial Times, citing multiple unnamed sources with knowledge of the incident. The breach has not been disclosed publicly. The fault stemmed from discrepancies between Revolut's U.S. and European systems, causing funds to be erroneously refunded using its own money when some transactions were declined. The problem was first detected in late 2021. But before it could be closed, the report said organized criminal groups leveraged the loophole by "encouraging individuals to try to make expensive purchases that would go on to be declined." The refunded amounts would then be withdrawn from ATMs. The exact technical details associated with the flaw are currently unclear. About $23 million was stolen in total, with some funds recovered by pursuing those who had withdrawn cash. The mass

An e-crime actor of Mexican provenance has been linked to an Android mobile malware campaign targeting financial institutions globally, but with a specific focus on Spanish and Chilean banks, from June 2021 to April 2023.

BlackCat Operators Distributing Ransomware Disguised as WinSCP via Malvertising<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/blackcat-operators-distributing.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the&nbsp; BlackCat ransomware &nbsp;have been observed employing malvertising tricks to distribute rogue installers of the WinSCP file transfer application. "Malicious actors used malvertising to distribute a piece of malware via cloned webpages of legitimate organizations," Trend Micro researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. "In this case, the distribution involved a webpage of the well-known application WinSCP, an open-source Windows application for file transfer." Malvertising &nbsp; refers &nbsp;to the use of&nbsp; SEO poisoning techniques &nbsp;to spread malware via online advertising. It typically involves hijacking a chosen set of keywords to display bogus ads on Bing and Google search results pages with the goal of redirecting unsuspecting users to sketchy pages. The idea is to trick users searching for applications like WinSCP into downloading malware, in this instance, a backdoor that contains a&nbsp; Cobalt Strike Beacon &nbsp;that connects to a

Cybercriminals Hijacking Vulnerable SSH Servers in New Proxyjacking Campaign<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/cybercriminals-hijacking-vulnerable-ssh.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An active financially motivated campaign is targeting vulnerable SSH servers to covertly ensnare them into a proxy network. "This is an active campaign in which the attacker leverages SSH for remote access, running malicious scripts that stealthily enlist victim servers into a peer-to-peer (P2P) proxy network, such as Peer2Profit or Honeygain," Akamai researcher Allen West said in a Thursday report. Unlike cryptojacking, in which a compromised system's resources are used to illicitly mine cryptocurrency, proxyjacking offers the ability for threat actors to leverage the victim's unused bandwidth to covertly run different services as a P2P node. This offers two-fold benefits: It not only enables the attacker to monetize the extra bandwidth with a significantly reduced resource load that would be necessary to carry out cryptojacking, it also reduces the chances of discovery. "It is a stealthier alternative to cryptojacking and has serious implications that ca

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have exposed the workings of a scam ring called CryptosLabs that's estimated to have made €480 million in illegal profits by targeting users in French-speaking individuals in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg since April 2018. The syndicate's massive fake investment schemes primarily involve impersonating 40 well-known banks, fin-techs, asset management firms, and crypto platforms, setting up a scam infrastructure spanning over 350 domains hosted on more than 80 servers, Group-IB&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep-dive report. The Singapore-headquartered company described the criminal outfit as "operated by a hierarchy of kingpins, sales agents, developers, and call center operators" who are recruited to ensnare potential victims by promising high returns on their capital. "CryptoLabs made their scam schemes more convincing through region-focused tactics, such as hiring French-speaking callers as 'managers' and creating fake landing pages, socia

A U.K. citizen who took part in the massive July 2020 hack of Twitter has been sentenced to five years in prison in the U.S. Joseph James O'Connor (aka PlugwalkJoe), 24, was awarded the sentence on Friday in the Southern District of New York, a little over a month&nbsp; after &nbsp;he&nbsp; pleaded guilty &nbsp;to the criminal schemes. He was&nbsp; arrested &nbsp;in Spain in July 2021. The infamous Twitter breach allowed the defendant and his co-conspirators to obtain unauthorized access to backend tools used by Twitter, abusing them to hijack 130 popular accounts to perpetrate a crypto scam that netted them about $120,000 in illegal profits. "In other instances, the co-conspirators sold access to Twitter accounts to others," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)&nbsp; said . "O'Connor communicated with others regarding purchasing unauthorized access to a variety of Twitter accounts, including accounts associated with public figures around the world."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor known as&nbsp; Muddled Libra &nbsp;is targeting the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry with persistent attacks that leverage advanced social engineering ploys to gain initial access. "The attack style defining Muddled Libra appeared on the cybersecurity radar in late 2022 with the release of the 0ktapus phishing kit, which offered a prebuilt hosting framework and bundled templates," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. Libra is the&nbsp; designation &nbsp;given by the cybersecurity company for cybercrime groups. The "muddled" moniker for the threat actor stems from the prevailing ambiguity with regards to the use of the 0ktapus framework. 0ktapus , also known as Scatter Swine, refers to an intrusion set that first came to light in August 2022 in connection with smishing attacks against over 100 organizations, including Twilio and Cloudflare.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has charged two Russian nationals in connection with masterminding the 2014 digital heist of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox. According to unsealed indictments released last week, Alexey Bilyuchenko, 43, and Aleksandr Verner, 29, have been accused of conspiring to launder approximately 647,000 bitcoins stolen from September 2011 through at least May 2014 as a result of unauthorized access to a server holding crypto wallets used by Mt.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A fully undetectable (FUD) malware obfuscation engine named&nbsp; BatCloak &nbsp;is being used to deploy various malware strains since September 2022, while persistently evading antivirus detection. The samples grant "threat actors the ability to load numerous malware families and exploits with ease through highly obfuscated batch files," Trend Micro researchers&nbsp; said . About 79.6% of the total 784 artifacts unearthed have no detection across all security solutions, the cybersecurity firm added, highlighting BatCloak's ability to circumvent traditional detection mechanisms. The BatCloak engine forms the crux of an off-the-shelf batch file builder tool called Jlaive, which comes with capabilities to bypass Antimalware Scan Interface ( AMSI ) as well as compress and encrypt the primary payload to achieve heightened security evasion.

Brazilian Cybercriminals Using LOLBaS and CMD Scripts to Drain Bank Accounts<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/brazilian-cybercriminals-using-lolbas.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown cybercrime threat actor has been observed targeting Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking victims to compromise online banking accounts in Mexico, Peru, and Portugal. "This threat actor employs tactics such as LOLBaS (living-off-the-land binaries and scripts), along with CMD-based scripts to carry out its malicious activities," the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. The cybersecurity company attributed the campaign, dubbed Operation CMDStealer , to a Brazilian threat actor based on an analysis of the artifacts. The attack chain primarily leverages social engineering, banking on Portuguese and Spanish emails containing tax- or traffic violation-themed lures to trigger the infections and gain unauthorized access to victims' systems. The emails come fitted with an HTML attachment that contains obfuscated code to fetch the next-stage payload from a remote server in the form of a RAR archive file. The files, which are

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unmasked the identity of one of the individuals who is believed to be associated with the e-crime actor known as&nbsp; XE Group . According to&nbsp; Menlo Security , which pieced together the information from different online sources, "Nguyen Huu Tai, who also goes by the names Joe Nguyen and Thanh Nguyen, has the strongest likelihood of being involved with the XE Group." XE Group (aka XeThanh), previously documented by&nbsp; Malwarebytes &nbsp;and&nbsp; Volexity , has a history of carrying out cyber criminal activities since at least 2013. It's suspected to be a threat actor of Vietnamese origin. Some of the entities targeted by the threat actor span government agencies, construction organizations, and healthcare sectors. It's known to compromise internet-exposed servers with known exploits and monetize the intrusions by installing password theft or&nbsp; credit card skimming code &nbsp;for online services.

Cybercriminals Targeting Apache NiFi Instances for Cryptocurrency Mining<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/cybercriminals-targeting-apache-nifi.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A financially motivated threat actor is actively scouring the internet for unprotected&nbsp; Apache NiFi instances &nbsp;to covertly install a cryptocurrency miner and facilitate lateral movement. The findings come from the SANS Internet Storm Center (ISC), which detected a spike in HTTP requests for "/nifi" on May 19, 2023. "Persistence is achieved via timed processors or entries to cron,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Dr. Johannes Ullrich, dean of research for SANS Technology Institute. "The attack script is not saved to the system. The attack scripts are kept in memory only." A honeypot setup allowed the ISC to determine that the initial foothold is weaponized to drop a shell script that removes the "/var/log/syslog" file, disables the firewall, and terminates competing crypto-mining tools, before downloading and launching the Kinsing malware from a remote server. It's worth pointing out that&nbsp; Kinsing &nbsp;has a&nbsp; track record &nbsp;of&nbsp; leveraging &nbsp;publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in publicly accessible web applicati

CAPTCHA-Breaking Services with Human Solvers Helping Cybercriminals Defeat Security<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/captcha-breaking-services-with-human.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are warning about CAPTCHA-breaking services that are being offered for sale to bypass systems designed to distinguish legitimate users from bot traffic. "Because cybercriminals are keen on breaking CAPTCHAs accurately, several services that are primarily geared toward this market demand have been created," Trend Micro&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "These CAPTCHA-solving services don't use [optical character recognition] techniques or advanced machine learning methods; instead, they break CAPTCHAs by farming out CAPTCHA-breaking tasks to actual human solvers." CAPTCHA &nbsp;– short for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart – is a tool for differentiating real human users from automated users with the goal of combating spam and restricting fake account creation. While CAPTCHA mechanisms can be a&nbsp; disruptive user experience , they are seen as an effective means to counter attacks from bot-ori

The threat actors behind the nascent&nbsp; Buhti &nbsp;ransomware have eschewed their custom payload in favor of leaked LockBit and Babuk ransomware families to strike Windows and Linux systems.

Buhti was first highlighted by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 in February 2023,&nbsp; describing &nbsp;it as a Golang ransomware targeting the Linux platform. Later that same month, Bitdefender revealed the use of a Windows variant that was deployed against Zoho ManageEngine products that were vulnerable to critical remote code execution flaws ( CVE-2022-47966 ).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A financially motivated threat actor of Indonesian origin has been observed leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances to carry out illicit crypto mining operations. Cloud security company's Permiso P0 Labs, which first detected the group in November 2021, has assigned it the moniker&nbsp; GUI-vil &nbsp;(pronounced Goo-ee-vil).

"Upon gaining AWS Console access, they conduct their operations directly through the web browser." Attack chains mounted by GUI-vil entail obtaining initial access by weaponizing AWS keys in publicly exposed source code repositories on GitHub or scanning for GitLab instances that are vulnerable to remote code execution flaws (e.g.,&nbsp; CVE-2021-22205 ).

The notorious cybercrime group known as FIN7 has been observed deploying&nbsp; Cl0p &nbsp;(aka Clop) ransomware, marking the threat actor's first ransomware campaign since late 2021.

The National Police of Spain said it arrested 40 individuals for their alleged involvement in an organized crime gang called Trinitarians . Among those apprehended include two hackers who carried out bank scams through phishing and smishing techniques and 15 other members of the crime syndicate, who have all been charged with a number of offenses such as bank fraud, forging documents, identity theft, and money laundering. In all, the nefarious scheme is believed to have defrauded more than 300,000 victims, resulting in losses of over €700,000. "The criminal organization used hacking tools and business logistics to carry out computer scams," officials&nbsp; said . To pull off the attacks, the cybercriminals sent bogus links via SMS that, when clicked, redirected users to a phishing panel masquerading as legitimate financial institutions to steal their credentials and abuse the access to request for loans and link the cards to cryptocurrency wallets under their control.

U.S. Authorities Seize 13 Domains Offering Criminal DDoS-for-Hire Services<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/us-authorities-seize-13-domains.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. authorities have announced the seizure of 13 internet domains that offered DDoS-for-hire services to other criminal actors. The takedown is part of an ongoing international initiative dubbed&nbsp; Operation PowerOFF &nbsp;that's aimed at dismantling criminal DDoS-for-hire infrastructures worldwide. The development comes almost five months after a "sweep" in December 2022&nbsp; dismantled 48 similar services &nbsp;for abetting paying users to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets of interest. This includes school districts, universities, financial institutions, and government websites, according to the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ). Ten of the 13 illicit domains seized are "reincarnations" of booter or stresser services that were previously shuttered towards the end of last year. "In recent years, booter services have continued to proliferate, as they offer a low barrier to entry for users looking to engage in cybercriminal activity,

An international law enforcement operation has resulted in the arrest of 288 vendors who are believed to be involved in drug trafficking on the dark web, adding to a long list of&nbsp; criminal enterprises &nbsp;that have been shuttered in recent years. The effort, codenamed Operation SpecTor , also saw the authorities confiscating more than $53.4 million in cash and virtual currencies, 850 kg of drugs, and 117 firearms. The largest number of arrests were made in the U.S. (153), followed by the U.K. (55), Germany (52), the Netherlands (10), Austria (9), France (5), Switzerland (2), Poland (1), and Brazil (1). "This represents the most funds seized and the highest number of arrests in any coordinated international action," U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland&nbsp; said . "The drug traffickers are confident that, by operating anonymously on the dark web, they can operate outside the bounds of the law. They are wrong."

The notorious North Korea-aligned state-sponsored actor known as the&nbsp; Lazarus Group &nbsp;has been attributed to a new campaign aimed at Linux users.

It also&nbsp; exhibits overlaps &nbsp;with two other Lazarus clusters known as Operation In(ter)ception and Operation North Star.

A new strain of malware developed by threat actors likely affiliated with the FIN7 cybercrime group has been put to use by the members of the now-defunct Conti ransomware gang, indicating collaboration between the two crews.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious loader programs capable of trojanizing Android applications are being traded on the criminal underground for up to $20,000 as a way to evade Google Play Store defenses. "The most popular application categories to hide malware and unwanted software include cryptocurrency trackers, financial apps, QR-code scanners, and even dating apps," Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report based on messages posted on online forums between 2019 and 2023. Dropper apps &nbsp;are the primary means for threat actors looking to sneak malware via the Google Play Store. Such apps often masquerade as seemingly innocuous apps, with malicious updates introduced upon clearing the review process and the applications have amassed a significant user base. This is achieved by using a loader program that's responsible for injecting malware into a clean app, which is then made available for download from the app marketplace.

Coinciding with the infrastructure seizure, the major crackdown, which involved authorities from 17 countries, culminated in 119 arrests and 208 property searches in 13 nations. However, the&nbsp; .onion mirror of the market &nbsp;appears to be still up and running . The "unprecedented"&nbsp; law &nbsp; enforcement &nbsp; exercise &nbsp;has been codenamed&nbsp; Operation Cookie Monster . Genesis Market, since its inception in March 2018, evolved into a major hub for criminal activities, offering access to data stolen from over 1.5 million compromised computers across the world totaling more than 80 million credentials. A majority of infections associated with Genesis Market related malware have been detected in the U.S., Mexico, Germany, Turkey, Sweden, Italy, France, Spain, Po

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's a case of setting a thief to catch a thief, the U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) revealed that it has created a network of fake DDoS-for-hire websites to infiltrate the online criminal underground. "All of the NCA-run sites, which have so far been accessed by around several thousand people, have been created to look like they offer the tools and services that enable cyber criminals to execute these attacks," the law enforcement agency&nbsp; said . "However, after users register, rather than being given access to cyber crime tools, their data is collated by investigators." The effort is part of an ongoing international joint effort called Operation PowerOFF in collaboration with authorities from the U.S., the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, and Europol aimed at dismantling criminal DDoS-for-hire infrastructures worldwide. DDoS-for-hire (aka "Booter" or "Stresser") services rent out access to a network of infected devices to other crim

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In a sudden turn of events, Baphomet, the current administrator of BreachForums, said in an update on March 21, 2023, that the hacking forum has been officially taken down but emphasized that "it's not the end." "You are allowed to hate me, and disagree with my decision but I promise what is to come will be better for us all," Baphomet noted in a message posted on the BreachForums Telegram channel. The&nbsp; shutdown &nbsp;is suspected to have been prompted by suspicions that law enforcement may have obtained access to the site's configurations, source code, and information about the forum's users. The development follows the&nbsp; arrest of its administrator &nbsp;Conor Brian Fitzpatrick (aka "pompompurin"), who has been charged with a single count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud. Over the past few months, BreachForums filled the void left by RaidForums last year, becoming a lucrative destination to purchase and sell stolen databases from variou

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. law enforcement authorities have arrested a New York man in connection with running the infamous BreachForums hacking forum under the online alias " Pompompurin ." The development, first reported by&nbsp; Bloomberg Law , comes after News 12 Westchester, earlier this week, said that federal investigators "spent hours inside and outside of a home in Peekskill." "At one point, investigators were seen removing several bags of evidence from the house," the New York-based local news service&nbsp; added . According &nbsp;to an&nbsp; affidavit &nbsp;filed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the suspect identified himself as Conor Brian Fitzpatrick and that he admitted to being the owner of the BreachForums website. "When I arrested the defendant on March 15, 2023, he stated to me in substance and in part that: a) his name was Conor Brian Fitzpatrick; b) he used the alias 'pompompurin,' and c) he was the owner and administrator of 'BreachForums,'&amp;

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coalition of law enforcement agencies across Europe and the U.S.&nbsp; announced &nbsp;the takedown of ChipMixer, an unlicensed cryptocurrency mixer that began its operations in August 2017. "The ChipMixer software blocked the blockchain trail of the funds, making it attractive for cybercriminals looking to launder illegal proceeds from criminal activities such as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, ransomware attacks, and payment card fraud," Europol&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. The coordinated exercise, besides dismantling the clearnet and dark web websites associated with ChipMixer, also resulted in the seizure of $47.5 million in Bitcoin and 7 TB of data. Mixers, also called tumblers,&nbsp; offer full anonymity &nbsp;for a fee by commingling cryptocurrency from different users – both legitimate and criminally-derived funds – in a manner that makes it hard to trace the origins. This is achieved by funneling different payments into a single pool before splitting up each amount and transmit

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coordinated international law enforcement exercise has taken down the online infrastructure associated with a cross-platform remote access trojan (RAT) known as NetWire . Coinciding with the seizure of the sales website www.worldwiredlabs[.]com, a Croatian national who is suspected to be the website's administrator has been arrested. While the suspect's name was not released, investigative journalist Brian Krebs&nbsp; identified &nbsp;Mario Zanko as the owner of the domain. "NetWire is a licensed commodity RAT offered in underground forums to non-technical users to carry out their own criminal activities," Europol's European Cybercrime Center (EC3)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a tweet. Advertised&nbsp; since &nbsp; at least 2012 , the malware is typically distributed via&nbsp; malspam campaigns &nbsp;and gives a remote attacker complete control over a Windows, macOS, or Linux system.

The North Korea-linked&nbsp; Lazarus Group &nbsp;has been observed weaponizing flaws in an undisclosed software to breach a financial business entity in South Korea twice within a span of a year. While the first attack in May 2022 entailed the use of a vulnerable version of a certificate software that's widely used by public institutions and universities, the re-infiltration in October 2022 involved the exploitation of a zero-day in the same program. Cybersecurity firm AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;it's refraining from mentioning the software owing to the fact that "the vulnerability has not been fully verified yet and a software patch has not been released." The adversarial collective, after obtaining an initial foothold by an unknown method, abused the zero-day bug to perform lateral movement, shortly after which the AhnLab V3 anti-malware engine was disabled via a&nbsp; BYOVD attack .

Core Members of DoppelPaymer Ransomware Gang Targeted in Germany and Ukraine<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/core-members-of-doppelpaymer-ransomware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Law enforcement authorities from Germany and Ukraine have targeted suspected core members of a cybercrime group that has been behind large-scale attacks using DoppelPaymer ransomware. The operation, which took place on February 28, 2023, was carried out with support from the Dutch National Police (Politie) and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), according to Europol. This encompassed a raid of a German national's house as well as searches in the Ukrainian cities of Kiev and Kharkiv. A Ukrainian national was also interrogated. Both individuals are believed to have taken up crucial positions in the DoppelPaymer group. "Forensic analysis of the seized equipment is still ongoing to determine the exact role of the suspects and their links to other accomplices," the agency further&nbsp; said . DoppelPaymer , according to cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, emerged in April 2019 and shares most of its code with another ransomware strain known as BitPaymer, which is attri

Cybercriminals Targeting Law Firms with GootLoader and FakeUpdates Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/cybercriminals-targeting-law-firms-with.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Six different law firms were targeted in January and February 2023 as part of two disparate threat campaigns distributing&nbsp; GootLoader &nbsp;and&nbsp; FakeUpdates &nbsp;(aka SocGholish) malware strains. GootLoader , active since late 2020, is a first-stage downloader that's capable of delivering a wide range of secondary payloads such as Cobalt Strike and ransomware. It notably&nbsp; employs &nbsp;search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning to funnel victims searching for business-related documents toward drive-by download sites that drop the JavaScript malware. In the&nbsp; campaign &nbsp;detailed by cybersecurity company eSentire, the threat actors are said to have compromised legitimate, but vulnerable, WordPress websites and added new blog posts without the owners' knowledge. "When the computer user navigates to one of these malicious web pages and hits the link to download the purported business agreement, they are unknowingly downloading GootLoader," eSentire researcher Keegan Keplinger&nbsp; said

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Dutch police announced the arrest of three individuals in connection with a "large-scale" criminal operation involving data theft, extortion, and money laundering. The suspects include two 21-year-old men from Zandvoort and Rotterdam and an 18-year-old man without a permanent residence. The arrests were made on January 23, 2023. It's estimated that the hackers stole personal data belonging to tens of millions of individuals. This comprised names, addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, credit cards, passwords, license plates, social security numbers, and passport details. The Politie said its cybercrime team started the investigation nearly two years ago, in March 2021, after a large Dutch company suffered a security breach. The name of the company was not disclosed but some of the firms that were hit by a cyber attack around that time included&nbsp; RDC ,&nbsp; Shell , and&nbsp; Ticketcounter , the last of which was also a victim of an extortion att

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Norwegian police agency Økokrim has announced the seizure of 60 million NOK (about $5.84 million) worth of cryptocurrency stolen by the Lazarus Group in March 2022 following the Axie Infinity Ronin Bridge hack. "This case shows that we also have a great capacity to follow the money on the blockchain, even if the criminals use advanced methods," the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. The development comes more than 10 months after the U.S. Treasury Department&nbsp; implicated &nbsp;the North Korea-backed hacking group for the theft of $620 million from the Ronin cross-chain bridge. Then in September 2022, the U.S. government&nbsp; announced &nbsp;the recovery of more than $30 million worth of cryptocurrency, representing 10% of the stolen funds. Økokrim said it worked with international law enforcement partners to follow and piece together the money trail, thereby making it more difficult for criminal actors to carry out money laundering activities.

A Russian national on February 7, 2023, pleaded guilty in the U.S. to money laundering charges and for attempting to conceal the source of funds obtained in connection with Ryuk ransomware attacks. Denis Mihaqlovic Dubnikov, 30, was&nbsp; arrested &nbsp;in Amsterdam in November 2021 before he was extradited from the Netherlands in August 2022. He is awaiting sentencing on April 11, 2023.

Dubnikov and his accomplices are said to have engaged in various criminal schemes designed to obscure the trail of the ill-gotten proceeds. According to DoJ, a chunk of the 250 Bitcoin ransom paid by a U.S. company in July 2019 after a Ryuk attack was sent to Dubnikov in exchange for about $400,000.

An Iranian nation-state group sanctioned by the U.S. government has been attributed to the hack of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in early January 2023. Microsoft, which disclosed details of the incident, is tracking the activity cluster under its chemical element-themed moniker&nbsp; NEPTUNIUM , which is an Iran-based company known as Emennet Pasargad. In January 2022, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)&nbsp; tied &nbsp;the state-backed cyber unit to a sophisticated influence campaign carried out to&nbsp; interfere &nbsp;with the 2020 presidential elections. Two Iranian nationals have been accused for their role in the disinformation and threat campaign. Microsoft's disclosure comes after a "hacktivist" group named Holy Souls (now identified as NEPTUNIUM) claimed to be in possession of the personal information of more than 200,000 Charlie Hebdo customers, including their full names, telephone numbers, and home and email addresses.

In what's a case of hacking the hackers, the darknet infrastructure associated with the Hive ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation has been seized as part of a coordinated law enforcement effort involving 13 countries.

FBI Says North Korean Hackers Behind $100 Million Horizon Bridge Crypto Theft<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/fbi-says-north-korean-hackers-behind.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Monday confirmed that North Korean threat actors were responsible for the theft of $100 million in cryptocurrency assets from&nbsp; Harmony Horizon Bridge &nbsp;in June 2022. The law enforcement agency attributed the hack to the&nbsp; Lazarus Group &nbsp;and APT38 (aka BlueNoroff, Copernicium, and Stardust Chollima), the latter of which&nbsp;is a North Korean state-sponsored threat group that specializes in financial cyber operations. The FBI further stated the Harmony intrusion leveraged an attack campaign dubbed&nbsp; TraderTraitor &nbsp;that was disclosed by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in April 2022. The modus operandi entailed utilizing social engineering tricks to deceive employees of cryptocurrency companies into downloading rogue applications as part of a seemingly benign recruitment effort. "On Friday, January 13, 2023, North Korean cyber actors used RAILGUN, a privacy protocol, to launder over $60 million worth of

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Wednesday announced the arrest of Anatoly Legkodymov (aka Gandalf and Tolik), the cofounder of Hong Kong-registered cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato, for allegedly&nbsp;processing $700 million in illicit funds. The 40-year-old Russian national, who was arrested in Miami, was charged in a U.S. federal court with "conducting a money transmitting business that transported and transmitted illicit funds and that failed to meet U.S. regulatory safeguards, including anti-money laundering requirements," the DoJ&nbsp; said . According to court documents, Bitzlato is said to have advertised itself as a virtual currency exchange with minimal identification requirements for its users, breaking the rules requiring the vetting of customers. This lack of know your customer (KYC) enforcement led to the service becoming a "haven for criminal proceeds" and facilitating transactions worth more than $700 million on the Hydra darknet marketplace prior

Cybercriminals Using Polyglot Files in Malware Distribution to Fly Under the Radar<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/cybercriminals-using-polyglot-files-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Remote access trojans such as StrRAT and Ratty are being distributed as a combination of polyglot and malicious Java archive ( JAR ) files, once again highlighting how threat actors are continuously finding new ways to fly under the radar. "Attackers now use the polyglot technique to confuse security solutions that don't properly validate the JAR file format," Deep Instinct security researcher Simon Kenin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. Polyglot files &nbsp;are files that combine syntax from two or more different formats in a manner such that each format can be parsed without raising any error. One such 2022 campaign spotted by the cybersecurity firm is the use of JAR and MSI formats – i.e., a file that's valid both as a JAR and an MSI installer – to deploy the StrRAT payload. This also means that the file can be executed by both Windows and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) based on how it's interpreted. Another instance involves the use of CAB and JAR polyglots to deliver bot

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A cybercrime group dubbed Bluebottle has been linked to a set of targeted attacks against the financial sector in Francophone countries located in Africa from at least July 2022 to September 2022. "The group makes extensive use of living-off-the-land, dual use tools, and commodity malware, with no custom malware deployed in this campaign," Symantec, a division of Broadcom Software,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity firm said the activity shares overlaps with a threat cluster tracked by Group-IB under the name&nbsp; OPERA1ER , which has carried out dozens of attacks aimed at banks, financial services, and telecom companies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America between 2018 and 2022. The attribution stems from similarities in the toolset used, the attack infrastructure, the absence of bespoke malware, and the targeting of French-speaking nations in Africa. Three different unnamed financial institutions in three African nations were breached, although

The ransomware crew, also known as&nbsp; Tropical Scorpius , has been observed targeting financial services, government facilities, healthcare, critical manufacturing, and IT sectors, while simultaneously expanding its tactics to gain initial access and interact with breached networks.   It's worth noting that despite the name "Cuba," there is no evidence to suggest that the actors have any connection or affiliation with the island country.

Interpol on Thursday&nbsp; announced &nbsp;the seizure of $130 million worth of virtual assets in connection with a global crackdown on cyber-enabled financial crimes and money laundering.  The international police operation, dubbed&nbsp; HAECHI-III , transpired between June 28 and November 23, 2022, resulting in the arrests of 975 individuals and the closure of more than 1,600 cases.  This comprised two fugitives wanted by South Korea for their supposed involvement in a Ponzi scheme to embezzle €28 million from 2,000 victims.   Another instance pertained to a call center scam based out of India, wherein a group of criminals impersonated Interpol and Europol officers to trick victims in Austria into transferring funds. The call centers operated from New Delhi and Noida.  The illegal activity informed the victims that their "identities were stolen and crime pertaining to narcotics drugs were committed in their names," forcing them to make a money transfer.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Companies based in the U.S. have been at the receiving end of an "aggressive" Qakbot malware campaign that leads to Black Basta ransomware infections on compromised networks.  "In this latest campaign, the Black Basta ransomware gang is using QakBot malware to create an initial point of entry and move laterally within an organization's network," Cybereason researchers Joakim Kandefelt and Danielle Frankel&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Black Basta, which emerged in April 2022, follows the tried-and-tested approach of double extortion to steal sensitive data from targeted companies and use it as leverage to extort cryptocurrency payments by threatening to release the stolen information.   This is not the first time the ransomware crew has been observed using Qakbot (aka QBot, QuackBot, or Pinkslipbot).

First advertised on Russian cybercrime forums in April 2022, Aurora was offered as a commodity malware for other threat actors, describing it as a "multi-purpose botnet with stealing, downloading and remote access capabilities."   In the intervening months, the malware has been scaled down to a stealer that can harvest files of interest, data from 40 cryptocurrency wallets, and applications like Telegram.  Aurora also comes with a loader that can deploy a next-stage payloading using a PowerShell command.

Luna Moth Gang Invests in Call Centers to Target Businesses with Callback Phishing Campaigns<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/luna-moth-gang-invests-in-call-centers.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Luna Moth campaign has extorted hundreds of thousands of dollars from several victims in the legal and retail sectors.  The attacks are notable for employing a technique called&nbsp; callback phishing &nbsp;or telephone-oriented attack delivery ( TOAD ), wherein the victims are social engineered into making a phone call through phishing emails containing invoices and subscription-themed lures.  Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said the attacks are the "product of a single highly organized campaign," adding, "this threat actor has significantly invested in call centers and infrastructure that's unique to each victim."  The cybersecurity firm&nbsp; described &nbsp;the activity as a "pervasive multi-month campaign that is actively evolving."   What's notable about callback phishing is that the email messages are completely devoid of any malicious attachment or booby-trapped link, allowing them to evade detection and slip past email protection solutions.  These messages ty

The cybercrime group called Daixin Team  has leaked sample data belonging to AirAsia, a Malaysian low-cost airline, on its data leak portal.  The development comes a little over a week after the company fell victim to a ransomware attack on November 11 and 12, per&nbsp; DataBreaches.net .   The threat actors allegedly claim to have obtained the personal data associated with five million unique passengers and all of its employees.  The samples uploaded to the leak site reveal passenger information and the booking IDs as well as personal data related to the company's staff.   A spokesperson for the threat actor told DataBreaches.net that further attacks were not pursued owing to AirAsia's poor security measures and "the chaotic organization of the network."  Daixin Team was recently the subject of an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;from the U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies, which warned of attacks mainly aimed at the healthcare sector.

The threat actors behind the Hive ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) scheme have launched attacks against over 1,300 companies across the world, netting the gang $100 million in illicit payments as of November 2022.  "Hive ransomware has targeted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure sectors, including government facilities, communications, critical manufacturing, information technology, and — especially — Healthcare and Public Health (HPH)," U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence authorities&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert.  Active since June 2021, Hive's RaaS operation involves a mix of developers, who create and manage the malware, and affiliates, who are responsible for conducting the attacks on target networks by often purchasing initial access from initial access brokers (IABs).   In most cases, gaining a foothold involves the exploitation of&nbsp; ProxyShell flaws &nbsp;in Microsoft Exchange Server, followed by taking steps to terminate processes associated with antivirus engi

A Ukrainian national who has been wanted by the U.S for over a decade has been arrested by Swiss authorities for his role in a notorious cybercriminal ring that stole millions of dollars from victims' bank accounts using malware called Zeus .

The Raspberry Robin  worm is becoming an access-as-a-service malware for deploying other payloads, including&nbsp; IcedID ,&nbsp; Bumblebee ,&nbsp; TrueBot &nbsp;(aka Silence), and&nbsp; Clop ransomware .  It is "part of a complex and interconnected malware ecosystem, with links to other malware families and alternate infection methods beyond its original USB drive spread," the Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a detailed write-up.  Raspberry Robin , also called QNAP Worm owing to the use of compromised QNAP storage servers for command-and-control, is the name given to a malware by cybersecurity company Red Canary that spreads to Windows systems through infected USB drives.  MSTIC is keeping tabs on the activity group behind the USB-based Raspberry Robin infections as&nbsp; DEV-0856 , adding it's aware of at least four confirmed entry points that all have the likely end goal of deploying ransomware.

Two point-of-sale (PoS) malware variants have been put to use by a threat actor to steal information related to more than 167,000 credit cards from payment terminals.  According to Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity company Group-IB, the stolen data dumps could net the operators as much as $3.34 million by selling them on underground forums.  While a significant proportion of attacks aimed at gathering payment data rely on&nbsp; JavaScript sniffers &nbsp;(aka web skimmers) stealthily inserted on e-commerce websites, PoS malware continues to be an ongoing, if less popular, threat.  Just last month, Kaspersky detailed new tactics adopted by a Brazilian threat actor known as&nbsp; Prilex &nbsp;to steal money by means of fraudulent transactions.   "Almost all PoS malware strains have a similar card dump extraction functionality, but different methods for maintaining persistence on infected devices, data exfiltration and processing," researchers Nikolay Shelekhov and Said Khamchiev&nbsp; said .

The Federal Police of Brazil on Wednesday announced it had arrested an individual for purported links to the notorious LAPSUS$ extortionist gang.

Also confiscated by the officials as part of the arrests were criminal assets worth €1,098,500, not to mention an internet domain that allegedly advertised the service online.

The threat actor behind the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) called Eternity has been linked to new piece of malware called LilithBot .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Australian Federal Police (AFP) has arrested a 19-year-old teen from Sydney for allegedly attempting to leverage the data leaked following the Optus data breach late last month to extort victims.  The suspect is said to have carried out a text message blackmail scam, demanding that the recipients transfer $2,000 to a bank account or risk getting their personal information misused for fraudulent activities.  The source of the data, the agency said, was a sample database of 10,200 records that was posted briefly on a cybercrime forum accessible on the clearnet by an actor named "optusdata," before taking it down.   Details of the scam were&nbsp; previously shared &nbsp;by 9News Australia reporter Chris O'Keefe on September 27, 2022.  The AFP further said it executed a search warrant at the home of the offender, leading to the seizure of a mobile phone used to send the text messages to about 93 Optus customers.

The&nbsp; BlackCat ransomware crew &nbsp;has been spotted fine-tuning their malware arsenal to fly under the radar and expand their reach.  "Among some of the more notable developments has been the use of a new version of the Exmatter data exfiltration tool, and the use of Eamfo, information-stealing malware that is designed to steal credentials stored by Veeam backup software," researchers from Symantec&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.

U.S. Seizes Cryptocurrency Worth $30 Million Stolen by North Korean Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/us-seizes-cryptocurrency-worth-30.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More than $30 million worth of cryptocurrency plundered by the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group from online video game Axie Infinity has been recovered, marking the first time digital assets stolen by the threat actor have been seized.  "The seizures represent approximately 10% of the total funds stolen from Axie Infinity (accounting for price differences between time stolen and seized), and demonstrate that it is becoming more difficult for bad actors to successfully cash out their ill-gotten crypto gains," Erin Plante, senior director of investigations at Chainalysis,&nbsp; said .  The development arrives more than five months after the&nbsp; crypto hack &nbsp;resulted in the theft of $620 million from the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Ronin Network, with the attackers laundering a majority of the proceeds – amounting to $455 million – through the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency tumbler Tornado Cash.   The March 2022 cryptocurrency heist resulted in losses totaling 173,600 ETH wort

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Former members of the Conti cybercrime cartel have been implicated in five different campaigns targeting Ukraine from April to August 2022.  The findings, which come from Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), builds upon a&nbsp; prior report &nbsp;published in July 2022, detailing the continued cyber activity aimed at the Eastern European nation amid the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war.  "UAC-0098 is a threat actor that historically delivered the&nbsp; IcedID banking trojan , leading to human-operated ransomware attacks," TAG researcher Pierre-Marc Bureau&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.   "The attacker has recently shifted their focus to targeting Ukrainian organizations, the Ukrainian government, and European humanitarian and non-profit organizations."  UAC-0098 is believed to have functioned as an initial access broker for ransomware groups such as Quantum and&nbsp; Conti &nbsp;(aka FIN12, Gold Ulrick, or Wizard Spiker), the former of which was&nbsp; subsumed by Conti &nbsp;in Apri

Ransomware Attackers Abuse Genshin Impact Anti-Cheat System to Disable Antivirus<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/ransomware-attackers-abuse-genshin.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A vulnerable anti-cheat driver for the Genshin Impact video game has been leveraged by a cybercrime actor to disable antivirus programs to facilitate the deployment of ransomware, according to findings from Trend Micro.  The ransomware infection, which was triggered in the last week of July 2022, banked on the fact that the driver in question ("mhyprot2.sys") is signed with a valid certificate, thereby making it possible to circumvent privileges and terminate services associated with endpoint protection applications.  Genshin Impact is a popular action role-playing game that was developed and published by Shanghai-based developer miHoYo in September 2020.   The driver used in the attack chain is said to have been built in August 2020, with the existence of the flaw in the module&nbsp; discussed &nbsp;after the release of the game, and leading to&nbsp; exploits &nbsp; demonstrating &nbsp;the ability to kill any arbitrary process and escalate to kernel mode.

Nation-state threat actors are&nbsp; increasingly adopting &nbsp;and integrating the Sliver  command-and-control (C2) framework in their intrusion campaigns as a replacement for Cobalt Strike.  "Given Cobalt Strike's popularity as an attack tool, defenses against it have also improved over time," Microsoft security experts&nbsp; said . "Sliver thus presents an attractive alternative for actors looking for a lesser-known toolset with a low barrier for entry."  Sliver, first made public in late 2019 by cybersecurity company BishopFox, is a Go-based&nbsp; open source C2 platform &nbsp;that supports user-developed extensions, custom implant generation, and other commandeering options.   "A C2 framework usually includes a server that accepts connections from implants on a compromised system, and a client application that allows the C2 operators to interact with the implants and launch malicious commands," Microsoft said.

Bitcoin ATM manufacturer General Bytes confirmed that it was a victim of a cyberattack that exploited a previously unknown flaw in its software to plunder cryptocurrency from its users.

CAS is short for&nbsp; Crypto Application Server , a self-hosted product from General Bytes that enables companies to manage Bitcoin ATM ( BATM ) machines from a central location via a web browser on a desktop or a mobile device.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. State Department on Thursday&nbsp; announced &nbsp;a $10 million reward for information related to five individuals associated with the Conti ransomware group.  The reward offer, first&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by WIRED, is also notable for the fact that it marks the first time the face of a Conti associate, known as "Target," has been unmasked. The four other associates have been referred to as "Tramp," "Dandis," "Professor," and "Reshaev."  The government, besides seeking information about the five operators that could lead to their identification or location, is also calling on people to share details about Conti and its affiliated groups&nbsp; TrickBot &nbsp;and&nbsp; Wizard Spider .   Since its rebrand from Ryuk to Conti, the transnational organized crime group has been linked to hundreds of ransomware incidents over the past two years.  As of January 2022, the Russia-based ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation is estimated to have hit over 1,000 entities, w

Conti Cybercrime Cartel Using 'BazarCall' Phishing Attacks as Initial Attack Vector<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/conti-cybercrime-cartel-using-bazarcall.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A trio of offshoots from the notorious Conti cybercrime cartel have resorted to the technique of call-back phishing as an initial access vector to breach targeted networks.  "Three autonomous threat groups have since adopted and independently developed their own targeted phishing tactics derived from the call back phishing methodology," cybersecurity firm AdvIntel&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report.  These targeted campaigns "substantially increased" attacks against entities in finance, technology, legal, and insurance sectors, the company added.  The actors in question include Silent Ransom, Quantum, and Roy/Zeon, all of which split from Conti after the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) cartel&nbsp; orchestrated its shutdown &nbsp;in May 2022 following its public support for Russia in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict.   The advanced social engineering tactic, also called&nbsp; BazaCall &nbsp;(aka BazarCall), came under the spotlight in 2020/2021 when it was put to use by operators of the

A 24-year-old Australian national has been charged for his purported role in the creation and sale of spyware for use by domestic violence perpetrators and child sex offenders.  Jacob Wayne John Keen, who currently resides at Frankston, Melbourne, is said to have created the remote access trojan (RAT) when he was 15, while also administering the tool from 2013 until its shutdown in 2019  as part of a coordinated Europol-led exercise.  "The Frankston man engaged with a network of individuals and sold the spyware, named Imminent Monitor  (IM), to more than 14,500 individuals across 128 countries," the Australian Federal Police (AFP)&nbsp; alleged &nbsp;in a press release over the weekend.   The defendant has been slapped with six counts of committing a computer offense by developing and supplying the malware, in addition to profiting off its illegal sale.

Spanish law enforcement officials have announced the arrest of two individuals in connection with a cyberattack on the country's radioactivity alert network (RAR), which took place between March and June 2021.  The act of sabotage is said to have disabled more than one-third of the sensors that are maintained by the Directorate-General for Civil Protection and Emergencies ( DGPCE ) and used to monitor excessive radiation levels across the country.  The reason for the attacks is unknown as yet.   "The two detainees, former workers, attacked the computer system and caused the connection of the sensors to fail, reducing their detection capacity even in the environment of nuclear power plants," the Policía Nacional&nbsp; said .  The law enforcement probe, dubbed Operation GAMMA, commenced in June 2021 in the aftermath of an attack perpetrated against the RAR network, which is a mesh of 800 gamma radiation detection sensors deployed in various parts of the country to detect surges

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has announced the seizure of $500,000 worth of Bitcoin from North Korean hackers who extorted digital payments from several organizations by using a new ransomware strain known as Maui.  "The seized funds include ransoms paid by healthcare providers in Kansas and Colorado," the DoJ&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a press release issued Tuesday.  The recovery of the bitcoin ransoms comes after the agency said it took control of two cryptocurrency accounts that were used to receive payments to the tune of $100,000 and $120,000 from the medical centers. The DoJ did not disclose where the rest of the payments originated from.   "Reporting cyber incidents to law enforcement and cooperating with investigations not only protects the United States, it is also good business," said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G.

The $540 million hack of Axie Infinity's&nbsp; Ronin Bridge &nbsp;in late March 2022 was the consequence of one of its former employees getting tricked by a fraudulent job offer on LinkedIn, it has emerged.&nbsp;  According to a report from&nbsp; The Block &nbsp;published last week citing two people familiar with the matter, a senior engineer at the company was duped into applying for a job at a non-existent company, causing the individual to download a fake offer document disguised as a PDF.  "After what one source described as multiple rounds of interviews, a Sky Mavis engineer was offered a job with an extremely generous compensation package," the Block reported.   The offer document subsequently acted as a conduit to deploy malware designed to breach Ronin's network, ultimately facilitating one of the crypto sector's biggest hacks to date.

The Cyber Police of Ukraine last week disclosed that it apprehended nine members of a criminal gang that embezzled 100 million hryvnias via hundreds of phishing sites that claimed to offer financial assistance to Ukrainian citizens as part of a campaign aimed at capitalizing on the ongoing conflict.  "Criminals created more than 400 phishing links to obtain bank card data of citizens and appropriate money from their accounts," the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a press statement last week. "The perpetrators may face up to 15 years behind bars."   The law enforcement operation culminated in the seizure of computer equipment, mobile phones, bank cards as well as the criminal proceeds illicitly obtained through the scheme.  Some of the rogue domains registered by the actors included ross0.yolasite[.]com, foundationua[.]com, ua-compensation[.]buzz, www.bless12[.]store, help-compensation[.]xyz, newsukraine10.yolasite[.]com, and euro24dopomoga0.yolasite[.]com, among others.

Vulnerability coordination and bug bounty platform HackerOne on Friday disclosed that a former employee at the firm improperly accessed security reports submitted to it for personal gain.

"In under 24 hours, we worked quickly to contain the incident by identifying the then-employee and cutting off access to data."  The employee, who had access to HackerOne systems between April 4 and June 23, 2022, for triaging vulnerability disclosures associated with different customer programs, has since been terminated by the San Francisco-headquartered company as of June 30.   Calling the incident as a "clear violation" of its values, culture, policies, and employment contracts, HackerOne said it was alerted to the breach on June 22 by an unnamed customer, which asked it to "investigate a suspicious vulnerabi

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) on Thursday disclosed it had acted to block as many as 36 malicious domains operated by hack-for-hire groups from India, Russia, and the U.A.E.  In a manner analogous to the&nbsp; surveillanceware ecosystem , hack-for-hire firms equip their clients with capabilities to enable targeted attacks aimed at corporates as well as activists, journalists, politicians, and other high-risk users.  Where the two stand apart is that while customers purchase the spyware from commercial vendors and then deploy it themselves, the operators behind hack-for-hire attacks are known to conduct the intrusions on their clients' behalf in order to obscure their role.  "The hack-for-hire landscape is fluid, both in how the attackers organize themselves and in the wide range of targets they pursue in a single campaign at the behest of disparate clients," Shane Huntley, director of Google TAG,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.

BlackCat Ransomware Gang Targeting Unpatched Microsoft Exchange Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/blackcat-ransomware-gang-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning that the BlackCat ransomware crew is leveraging exploits for&nbsp; unpatched Exchange server &nbsp;vulnerabilities to gain access to targeted networks.  Upon gaining an entry point, the attackers swiftly moved to gather information about the compromised machines, followed by carrying out credential theft and lateral movement activities, before harvesting intellectual property and dropping the ransomware payload.  The entire sequence of events played out over the course of two full weeks, the Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week.  "In another incident we observed, we found that a ransomware affiliate gained initial access to the environment via an internet-facing Remote Desktop server using compromised credentials to sign in," the researchers said, pointing out how "no two BlackCat 'lives' or deployments might look the same."   BlackCat , also known by the names ALPHV and Noberus, is a relatively n

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the workings of a fully-featured malware loader dubbed&nbsp; PureCrypter &nbsp;that's being purchased by cyber criminals to deliver remote access trojans (RATs) and information stealers.  "The loader is a .NET executable obfuscated with SmartAssembly and makes use of compression, encryption, and obfuscation to evade antivirus software products," Zscaler's Romain Dumont&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.   Some of the malware families distributed using PureCrypter include&nbsp; Agent Tesla ,&nbsp; Arkei ,&nbsp; AsyncRAT ,&nbsp; AZORult ,&nbsp; DarkCrystal RAT &nbsp;(DCRat),&nbsp; LokiBot ,&nbsp; NanoCore ,&nbsp; RedLine Stealer ,&nbsp; Remcos ,&nbsp; Snake Keylogger , and&nbsp; Warzone RAT .   Sold for a price of $59 by its developer named "PureCoder" for a one-month plan (and $249 for a one-off lifetime purchase) since at least March 2021, PureCrypter is advertised as the "only crypter in the market that uses offline and online delivery technique."

Cybercriminals are impersonating popular crypto platforms such as Binance, Celo, and Trust Wallet with spoofed emails and fake login pages in an attempt to steal login details and deceptively transfer virtual funds.

"The rise and proliferation of cryptocurrency has also provided attackers with a new method of financial extraction."  The targeting of sensitive cryptocurrency data by threat actors was recently echoed by the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team, which warned about the emerging threat of&nbsp; cryware &nbsp;wherein private keys, seed phrases, and wallet addresses are plundered with the goal of siphoning virtual currencies by means of fraudulent transfers.

An illicit online marketplace known as SSNDOB  was taken down in operation led by U.S. law enforcement agencies, the Department of Justice (DoJ) announced Tuesday.  SSNDOB trafficked in personal information such as names, dates of birth, credit card numbers, and Social Security numbers of about 24 million individuals in the U.S., generating its operators $19 million in sales revenue.  The action saw the seizure of several domains associated with the marketplace — ssndob.ws, ssndob.vip, ssndob.club, and blackjob.biz — in cooperation with authorities from Cyprus and Latvia.  According to blockchain analytics firm&nbsp; Chainalysis , SSNDOB's Bitcoin payment processing system has received nearly $22 million worth of Bitcoin across over 100,000 transactions since April 2015.   Furthermore, bitcoin transfers to the tune of more than $100,000 have been unearthed between SSNDOB and&nbsp; Joker's Stash , another darknet market that specialized in stolen credit card information and voluntarily c

The threat cluster dubbed UNC2165, which shares numerous overlaps with a Russia-based cybercrime group known as Evil Corp, has been linked to multiple LockBit ransomware intrusions in an attempt to get around&nbsp; sanctions &nbsp;imposed by the U.S. Treasury in December 2019.

Conti Leaks Reveal Ransomware Gang's Interest in Firmware-based Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/conti-leaks-reveal-ransomware-gangs.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of&nbsp; leaked chats &nbsp;from the notorious&nbsp; Conti ransomware group &nbsp;earlier this year has revealed that the syndicate has been working on a set of firmware attack techniques that could offer a path to accessing privileged code on compromised devices.  "Control over firmware gives attackers virtually unmatched powers both to directly cause damage and to enable other long-term strategic goals," firmware and hardware security firm Eclypsium&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "Such level of access would allow an adversary to cause irreparable damage to a system or to establish ongoing persistence that is virtually invisible to the operating system."   Specifically, this includes attacks aimed at embedded microcontrollers such as the Intel&nbsp; Management Engine &nbsp;( ME ), a privileged component that's part of the company's processor chipsets and which can completely bypass the operating system.  It's worth noting that the reason for this evolv

Interpol on Monday announced the arrest of three suspected global scammers in Nigeria for using remote access trojans (RATs) such as Agent Tesla to facilitate malware-enabled cyber fraud.

One of the scammers in question, named Hendrix Omorume, has been charged and convicted of three counts of financial fraud and has been sentenced to a 12-month prison term. The two other suspects are still on trial.  The three Nigerian individuals, who are aged between 31 and 38, have been apprehended for being in possession of fake documents such as fraudulent invoices and forged official letters.

A year-long international investigation has resulted in the arrest of the suspected head of the SilverTerrier cybercrime group by the Nigeria Police Force.  "The suspect is alleged to have run a transnational cybercrime syndicate that launched mass phishing campaigns and business email compromise schemes targeting companies and individual victims," Interpol&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement.   Operation Delilah, as the coordinated international effort is called, involved tracking the 37-year-old Nigerian man's physical movements, before he was apprehended at Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos.  Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity company Group-IB said  it provided threat intelligence that led to the arrest as part of the police operation that commenced in May 2021.   The development is the third in a series of law enforcement actions aimed at the identification and arrest of the suspected members of the SilverTerrier gang (aka TMT).

Even as the operators of Conti threatened to&nbsp; overthrow the Costa Rican government , the notorious cybercrime gang officially took down their infrastructure in favor of migrating their criminal activities to other ancillary operations, including Karakurt and BlackByte.  "From the negotiations site, chatrooms, messengers to servers and proxy hosts - the Conti brand, not the organization itself, is shutting down," AdvIntel researchers Yelisey Bogusalvskiy and Vitali Kremez&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "However, this does not mean that the threat actors themselves are retiring."  The voluntary termination, with the exception of its name-and-shame blog, is said to have occurred on May 19, 2022, while an organizational rejig was happening simultaneously to ensure a smooth transition of the ransomware group's members.

Threat actors behind web skimming campaigns are leveraging malicious JavaScript code that mimics Google Analytics and Meta Pixel scripts in an attempt to sidestep detection.

Skimming attacks, such as those by Magecart, are carried out with the goal of harvesting and exporting users' payment information, such as credit card details, entered into online payment forms in e-commerce platforms, typically during the checkout process.   This is achieved by taking advantage of security vulnerabilities in third-party plugins and other tools to inject rogue JavaScript code into the online portals without the owners' knowledge.

At least two research institutes located in Russia and a third likely target in Belarus have been at the receiving end of an espionage attack by a Chinese nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT).  The attacks, codenamed " Twisted Panda ," come in the backdrop of Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, prompting a&nbsp; wide range &nbsp;of&nbsp; threat actors &nbsp;to swiftly adapt their campaigns on the ongoing conflict to distribute malware and stage opportunistic attacks.  They have materialized in the form of social engineering schemes with topical war and sanctions-themed baits orchestrated to trick potential victims into clicking malicious links or opening weaponized documents.  Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point, which&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;details of the latest intelligence-gathering operation, attributed it a Chinese threat actor, with connections to that of&nbsp; Stone Panda &nbsp;(aka&nbsp; APT 10 , Cicada, or Potassium) and&nbsp; Mustang Panda &nbsp;(aka Bronze President, HoneyMyte, or RedDelta).

A 28-year-old Ukrainian national has been sentenced to four years in prison for siphoning thousands of server login credentials and selling them on the dark web for monetary gain as part of a credential theft scheme.

The illegal sale involved the trafficking of login credentials to servers located across the world and personally identifiable information such as dates of birth and Social Security numbers belonging to U.S. residents on a darknet marketplace.   The unnamed site purportedly offered over 700,000 compromised servers for sale, including at least 150,000 in the U.S. alone. Believed to have been operational from around October 2014, the underground marketplace was seized by law enforcement authorities on January 24, 2019, according to court documents.

New REvil Samples Indicate Ransomware Gang is Back After Months of Inactivity<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/new-revil-samples-indicate-ransomware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious ransomware operation known as REvil (aka Sodin or Sodinokibi) has resumed after six months of inactivity, an analysis of new ransomware samples has revealed.  "Analysis of these samples indicates that the developer has access to REvil's source code, reinforcing the likelihood that the threat group has reemerged," researchers from Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Monday.  "The identification of multiple samples with varying modifications in such a short period of time and the lack of an official new version indicates that REvil is under heavy active development once again."  REvil, short for Ransomware Evil, is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) scheme and attributed to a Russia-based/speaking group known as&nbsp; Gold Southfield , arising just as&nbsp; GandCrab &nbsp;activity declined and the latter announced their retirement.   It's also one of the earliest groups to adopt the double extortion scheme in which stolen data from

The U.S. State Department has&nbsp; announced &nbsp;rewards of up to $10 million for any information leading to the identification of key individuals who are part of the infamous Conti cybercrime gang.  Additionally, it's offering another $5 million for intelligence information that could help arrest or convict individuals who are conspiring or attempting to affiliate with the group in a ransomware attack.  The department called the Conti variant the "costliest strain of ransomware ever documented."   Conti , the work of a Russia-based transnational organized crime group dubbed Gold Ulrick, is one most prolific ransomware cartels that has continued to strike entities globally while simultaneously&nbsp; expanding its empire &nbsp;by absorbing TrickBot and running side hustles that involve data extortion.  After the syndicate expressed public support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, it&nbsp; suffered a major breach &nbsp;of its own after its source code and internal chats were released

Experts Analyze Conti and Hive Ransomware Gangs' Chats With Their Victims<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/experts-analyze-conti-and-hive.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of four months of chat logs spanning more than 40 conversations between the operators of Conti and Hive ransomware and their victims has offered an insight into the groups' inner workings and their negotiation techniques.  In one exchange, the Conti Team is said to have significantly reduced the ransom demand from a staggering $50 million to $1 million, a 98% drop, suggesting a willingness to settle for a far lower amount.  "Both Conti and Hive are quick to lower ransom demands, routinely offering substantial reductions multiple times throughout negotiations," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This signals that despite popular belief, victims of a ransomware attack actually have significant negotiating power."  Conti &nbsp;and&nbsp; Hive &nbsp;are among the most prevalent ransomware strains in the threat landscape, cumulatively accounting for&nbsp; 29.1% of attacks &nbsp;detected during the three-month-period between October and December 2021.

Chinese Hackers Caught Exploiting Popular Antivirus Products to Target Telecom Sector<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/chinese-hackers-caught-exploiting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese-aligned cyberespionage group has been observed striking the telecommunication sector in Central Asia with versions of malware such as ShadowPad and PlugX.  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne tied the intrusions to an actor it tracks under the name "Moshen Dragon," with tactical overlaps between the collective and another threat group referred to as Nomad Panda (aka&nbsp; RedFoxtrot ).  "PlugX and ShadowPad have a well-established history of use among Chinese-speaking threat actors primarily for espionage activity," SentinelOne's Joey Chen&nbsp; said . "Those tools have flexible, modular functionality and are compiled via shellcode to easily bypass traditional endpoint protection products."   ShadowPad , labeled a "masterpiece of privately sold malware in Chinese espionage," emerged as a successor to PlugX in 2015, even as variants of the latter have continually popped up as part of different campaigns associated with Chinese threat actors.

Cybercriminal actors previously observed delivering BazaLoader and IcedID as part of their malware campaigns are said to have transitioned to a new loader called Bumblebee that's under active development.

Campaigns distributing the new highly sophisticated loader are said to have commenced in March 2022, while&nbsp;sharing overlaps with malicious activity  leading to the deployment of Conti and Diavol ransomware, raising the possibility that the loader could act as a precursor for ransomware attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An 18-month-long analysis of the PYSA ransomware operation has revealed that the cybercrime cartel followed a five-stage software development cycle from August 2020, with the malware authors prioritizing features to improve the efficiency of its workflows.  This included a user-friendly tool like a full-text search engine to facilitate the extraction of metadata and enable the threat actors to find and access victim information quickly.  "The group is known to carefully research high-value targets before launching its attacks, compromising enterprise systems and forcing organizations to pay large ransoms to restore their data," Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an exhaustive report published last week.  PYSA, short for "Protect Your System, Amigo" and a successor of the Mespinoza ransomware, was first observed in December 2019 and has emerged as the third most prevalent ransomware strain detected during the fourth quarter of 2021.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Treasury Department has implicated the North Korea-backed Lazarus Group (aka Hidden Cobra) in the theft of $540 million from video game Axie Infinity's Ronin Network last month.  On Thursday, the Treasury&nbsp; tied &nbsp;the Ethereum&nbsp; wallet address &nbsp;that received the stolen funds to the threat actor and sanctioned the funds by adding the address to the Office of Foreign Assets Control's (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals ( SDN ) List.  "The FBI, in coordination with Treasury and other U.S. government partners, will continue to expose and combat the DPRK's use of illicit activities – including cybercrime and cryptocurrency theft – to generate revenue for the regime," the intelligence and law enforcement agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement.  The cryptocurrency heist, the second-largest cyber-enabled theft  to date, involved the siphoning of 173,600 Ether (ETH) and 25.5 million USD Coins from the Ronin cross-chain bridge, which allows users to transfer their digital as

A crimeware-related threat actor known as Haskers Gang  has released an&nbsp; information-stealing malware &nbsp;called ZingoStealer for free on, allowing other criminal groups to leverage the tool for nefarious purposes.  "It features the ability to steal sensitive information from victims and can download additional malware to infected systems," Cisco Talos researchers Edmund Brumaghin and Vanja Svajcer&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "In many cases, this includes the&nbsp; RedLine Stealer &nbsp;and an XMRig-based cryptocurrency mining malware that is internally referred to as 'ZingoMiner.'"  But in an interesting twist, the criminal group announced on Thursday that the ownership of the ZingoStealer project is changing hands to a new threat actor, in addition to offering to sell the source code for a negotiable price of $500.   Since its inception last month, ZingoStealer is said to be undergoing consistent development and deployed specifically against Russi

Germany Shuts Down Russian Hydra Darknet Market; Seizes $25 Million in Bitcoin<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/germany-shuts-down-russian-hydra.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office, the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA), on Tuesday announced the official takedown of Hydra, the world's largest illegal dark web marketplace that has cumulatively facilitated over $5 billion in Bitcoin transactions to date.  "Bitcoins amounting to currently the equivalent of approximately €23 million were seized, which are attributed to the marketplace," the BKA said  in a press release. Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic confirmed  that the seizure occurred on April 5, 2022 in a series of 88 transactions amounting to 543.3 BTC.   The agency attributed the shutdown of Hydra to an extensive investigation operation conducted by its Central Office for Combating Cybercrime (ZIT) in partnership with U.S. law enforcement authorities since August 2021.  Launched in 2015, Hydra was a Russian-language darknet marketplace that opened as a competitor to the now-defunct Russian Anonymous Marketplace (aka RAMP), primarily known for its high-traffic

You don't like having the FBI knocking on your door at 6 am in the morning. Surprisingly, nor does your usual cybercriminal. That is why they hide (at least the good ones), for example, behind layers of proxies, VPNs, or TOR nodes.  Their IP address will never be exposed directly to the target's machine. Cybercriminals will always use third-party IP addresses to deliver their attacks.  There are countless ways to deliver cyberattacks. But one thing is common to all of them. The need for a pool of IP addresses to serve as a medium. Criminals need IP addresses to deliver distributed denial of service attacks.  Criminals need IP addresses to hide behind when probing services. Criminals need IP addresses to attempt brute force attacks. Criminals need IP addresses to run bot networks and services. In a nutshell, criminals need to maintain IP addresses under their control for pretty much anything. It is their most important asset and is the ammo they need to deliver attacks.  So how

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of two ransomware attacks has&nbsp; identified overlaps &nbsp;in the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) between BlackCat and BlackMatter, indicating a strong connection between the two groups.  While it's typical of ransomware groups to rebrand their operations in response to increased visibility into their attacks,&nbsp; BlackCat &nbsp;(aka Alphv) marks a new frontier in that the cyber crime cartel is built out of affiliates of other ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations.  BlackCat first emerged in November 2021 and has since targeted several organizations worldwide over the past few months. It has been called out for being similar to&nbsp; BlackMatter , a short-lived ransomware family that originated from&nbsp; DarkSide , which attracted notoriety for its high-profile attack on&nbsp; Colonial Pipeline &nbsp;in May 2021.   In an interview with Recorded Future's The Record last month, a BlackCat representative dismissed rumors that it's a rebranding of BlackMatter, while noting that it

Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) took the wraps off a new&nbsp; initial access broker &nbsp;that it said is closely affiliated to a Russian cyber crime gang notorious for its Conti and Diavol ransomware operations.  Dubbed Exotic Lily, the financially motivated threat actor has been observed exploiting a now-patched critical flaw in the Microsoft Windows MSHTML platform ( CVE-2021-40444 ) as part of widespread phishing campaigns that involved sending no fewer than 5,000 business proposal-themed emails a day to 650 targeted organizations globally.  "Initial access brokers are the opportunistic locksmiths of the security world, and it's a full-time job," TAG researchers Vlad Stolyarov and Vlad Stolyarov&nbsp; said . "These groups specialize in breaching a target in order to open the doors — or the Windows — to the malicious actor with the highest bid."

Many of them are from the top leadership of the enemy army," the SBU&nbsp; alleged , adding it confiscated the equipment that was used to pull off the operation.

A Russian-speaking ransomware outfit likely targeted an unnamed entity in the gambling and gaming sector in Europe and Central America by repurposing custom tools developed by other APT groups like Iran's MuddyWater, new research has found.  The unusual attack chain involved the abuse of stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to the victim network, ultimately leading to the deployment of Cobalt Strike payloads on compromised assets,&nbsp; said &nbsp;Felipe Duarte and Ido Naor, researchers at Israeli incident response firm Security Joes, in a report published last week.   Although the infection was contained at this stage, the researchers characterized the compromise as a case of a suspected ransomware attack.  The intrusion is said to have taken place in February 2022, with the attackers making use of post-exploitation tools such as&nbsp; ADFind , NetScan,&nbsp; SoftPerfect , and&nbsp; LaZagne .

"With the exception of the overhauled C2 communication mechanism, AnchorMail's behavior aligns very closely to that of its AnchorDNS predecessor."   The cybercrime actor behind TrickBot, ITG23 aka Wizard Spider, is also known for its development of the Anchor malware framework, a backdoor reserved for targeting selected high value victims since at least 2018 via TrickBot and BazarBackdoor (aka BazarLoader), an additiona

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
TrickBot, the infamous Windows crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS) solution that's used by a variety of threat actors to deliver next-stage payloads like ransomware, appears to be undergoing a transition of sorts, with no new activity recorded since the start of the year.  The lull in the malware campaigns is "partially due to a big shift from Trickbot's operators, including working with the operators of Emotet," researchers from Intel 471&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The last set of attacks involving TrickBot were registered on December 28, 2021, even as command-and-control (C2) infrastructure associated with the malware has continued to serve additional plugins and&nbsp; web injects &nbsp;to infected nodes in the botnet.   Interestingly, the decrease in the volume of the campaigns has also been accompanied by the TrickBot gang working closely with the&nbsp; operators of Emotet , which witnessed a resurgence late last year after a 10-month-long break following law en

NFTs , short for non-fungible tokens, are digital tokens that act like certificates of authenticity for, and in some cases represent ownership of, assets that range from expensive illustrations to collectibles and physical goods.  The opportunistic social engineering scam&nbsp; swindled the users &nbsp;by using the same email from OpenSea notifying users about the upgrade, with the copycat email redirecting the victims to a lookalike webpage, prompting them to sign a seemingly legitimate transaction, only to steal all the NFTs in one go.   "By signing the transaction, an atomicMatch_ request would be sent to the attacker contract," Check Point researchers&nbsp; explained . "From there, the atomicMatch_ would be forwarded to the OpenSea contract," leading t

Spanish Police Arrest SIM Swappers Who Stole Money from Victims Bank Accounts<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/spanish-police-arrest-sim-swappers-who.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Spain's National Police Agency, the Policía Nacional, said last week it dismantled an unnamed cybercriminal organization and arrested eight individuals in connection with a series of SIM swapping attacks that were carried out with the goal of financial fraud.  The suspects of the crime ring masqueraded as trustworthy representatives of banks and other organizations and used traditional phishing and smishing techniques to obtain personal information and bank data of victims before draining money from their accounts.  "They usurped the identity of their victims through the falsification of official documents and tricked employees of telephone stores into getting the duplicate of SIM cards, cards where they received security confirmation messages from banks that allowed them to empty their victims' accounts," the authorities&nbsp; said .   Seven of the arrests were made in Barcelona and one in Seville. As many as 12 bank accounts were frozen as part of the illicit operation.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A special law enforcement operation undertaken by Russia has led to the seizure and shutdown of four online bazaars that specialized in the theft and sales of stolen credit cards, as the government continues to take active measures against harboring cybercriminals on its territory.  To that end, the domains operated by the card fraud forms and marketplaces, Ferum Shop, Sky-Fraud, Trump's Dumps, and UAS, were confiscated and plastered with a banner that warned "theft of funds from bank cards is illegal." Also embedded into the HTML source code was a message asking, "Which one of you is next?"  The seizures were orchestrated by the Department "K," a division of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation that focuses primarily on information technology-related crimes, according to&nbsp; Flashpoint . In a related development, state-owned news agency TASS&nbsp; said &nbsp;that six Russian individuals were being charged with "the illegal circulation o

"Bitfinex will work with the DoJ and follow appropriate legal processes to establish our rights to a return of the stolen bitcoin," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement, adding "We have been cooperating extensively with the DoJ since its investigation began and will continue to do so."

An Israeli national was sentenced to 97 months in prison in connection with operating the DeepDotWeb ( DDW ) clearnet website, nearly a year after the individual pleaded guilty to the charges.

He&nbsp; pleaded guilty &nbsp;to money laundering charges in March 2021 and agreed to forfeit the illegally amassed profits.  DDW, until its seizure in May 2019, ostensibly&nbsp; served &nbsp;as a "news" website that connected internet users with underground marketplaces on the dark web that operate via darknets such as Tor, enabling the purchase of illegal firearms, malware and hacking tools, stolen financial data, heroin, fentanyl, and other illicit materials.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coordinated law enforcement operation has resulted in the arrest of 11 members allegedly belonging to a Nigerian cybercrime gang notorious for perpetrating business email compromise (BEC) attacks targeting more than 50,000 victims in recent years.  The disruption of the BEC network is the result of a ten-day investigation dubbed&nbsp; Operation Falcon II &nbsp;undertaken by the Interpol along with participation from the Nigeria Police Force's Cybercrime Police Unit in December 2021.  Cybersecurity firms&nbsp; Group-IB &nbsp;and Palo Alto Networks'&nbsp; Unit 42 , both of which shared information on the threat actors and their infrastructure, said six of the 11 suspects are believed to be a part of a prolific group of Nigerian cyber actors known as SilverTerrier (aka TMT).   BEC attacks, which began to gain dominance in 2013, are&nbsp; sophisticated scams &nbsp;that target legitimate business email accounts through social engineering schemes to infiltrate corporate networks and subsequently leverage their acce

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Gone are the days when ransomware operators were happy with encrypting files on-site and more or less discretely charged their victims money for a decryption key. What we commonly find now is encryption with the additional threat of leaking stolen data, generally called Double-Extortion (or, as we like to call it: Cyber Extortion or Cy-X). This is a unique form of cybercrime in that we can observe and analyze some of the criminal action via 'victim shaming' leak sites.  Since January 2020, we have applied ourselves to identifying as many of these sites as possible to record and document the victims who feature on them. Adding our own research, analyzing, and enriching data scraped from the various Cy-X operators and market sites, we can provide direct insights into the victimology from this specific perspective.  We must be clear that what we are analyzing is a limited perspective on the crime. Nevertheless, the data gleaned from an analysis of the leak-threats proves to be ex

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VPNLab.net, a&nbsp; VPN provider &nbsp;that was used by malicious actors to deploy ransomware and facilitate other cybercrimes, was taken offline following a coordinated law enforcement operation.  Europol said it took action against the misuse of the VPN service by grounding 15 of its servers on January 17 and rendering it inoperable as part of a disruptive action that took place across Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Latvia, Ukraine, the U.S., and the U.K.  A second outcome of the seizure is that at least 100 businesses that have been identified as at risk of impending cyber attacks are being notified. Europol didn't disclose the names of the companies.   Established in 2008, the tool provided an advanced level of anonymity by offering double VPN connections to its clients — wherein the internet traffic is routed through two VPN servers located in different countries instead of one — for as cheap as $60 a year.

"It is [a] weighted decision, we are not young and our health do[es] not allow [us] to work like this any longer."  The UniCC team also gave its users 10 days to spend their balances, while also warning customers to "not follow any fakes tied to our comeback."

Cryptocurrency trading platform BitMart has disclosed a "large-scale security breach" that it blamed on a stolen private key, resulting in the theft of more than $150 million in various cryptocurrencies.  The breach is said to have impacted two of its hot wallets on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and the Binance smart chain (BSC). The company&nbsp; noted &nbsp;that the wallets carried only a "small percentage" of the assets." Hot wallets, as opposed to their cold counterparts, are connected to the internet and allow cryptocurrency owners to receive and send tokens.   Blockchain security and data analytics company PeckShield&nbsp; estimated &nbsp;the total loss to be around $200 million, calling the whole chain of events as "Pretty straightforward: transfer-out, swap, and wash."  "This security breach was mainly caused by a stolen private key that had two of our hot wallets compromised," BitMart's chief executive Sheldon Xia&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets sent

A joint four-month operation coordinated by Interpol, the international criminal police organization, has culminated in the arrests of more than 1,000 cybercriminals and the recovery of $27 million in illicit proceeds.  Codenamed " HAECHI-II ," the crackdown enabled law enforcement units from across 20 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macao, close 1,660 cases alongside blocking 2,350 bank accounts linked to the fraudulent illicit funds amassed from a range of online financial crimes, such as romance scams, investment fraud, and money laundering associated with illegal online gambling.  "The results of Operation HAECHI-II show that the surge in online financial crime generated by the COVID-19 pandemic shows no signs of waning,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock in a press statement issued on November 26.

The clearnet and dark web payment portals operated by the&nbsp; Conti &nbsp;ransomware group have gone down in what appears to be an attempt to shift to new infrastructure after details about the gang's inner workings and its members were made public.  According to&nbsp; MalwareHunterTeam , "while both the clearweb and Tor domains of the leak site of the Conti ransomware gang is online and working, both their clearweb and Tor domains for the payment site (which is obviously more important than the leak) is down."  It's not clear what prompted the shutdown, but the development comes as Swiss cybersecurity firm PRODAFT&nbsp; offered &nbsp;an unprecedented look into the group's ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, wherein the developers sell or lease their ransomware technology to affiliates hired from darknet forums, who then carry out attacks on their behalf while also netting about 70% of each ransom payment extorted from the victims.

A Russian national, who was arrested in South Korea last month and extradited to the U.S. on October 20, appeared in a federal court in the state of Ohio on Thursday to face charges for his alleged role as a member of the infamous TrickBot group.  Court documents showed that Vladimir Dunaev , 28, along with other members of the transnational, cybercriminal organization, stole money and confidential information from unsuspecting victims, including individuals, financial institutions, school districts, utility companies, government entities, and private businesses.   Starting its roots as a banking trojan in 2016, TrickBot has&nbsp; evolved &nbsp;into a modular, multi-stage Windows-based crimeware solution capable of pilfering valuable personal and financial information, and even dropping ransomware and post-exploitation toolkits on compromised devices. The malware is also&nbsp; notorious &nbsp;for its&nbsp; resilience , having survived at least two takedowns spearheaded by Microsoft and the U.S. Cyber Command

The Russian-led REvil ransomware gang was felled by an active multi-country law enforcement operation that resulted in its infrastructure being hacked and&nbsp; taken offline &nbsp;for a second time earlier this week, in what's the&nbsp; latest action &nbsp;taken by governments to disrupt the lucrative ecosystem.  The takedown was first reported by&nbsp; Reuters , quoting multiple private-sector cyber experts working with the U.S. government, noting that the&nbsp; May cyber attack &nbsp;on Colonial Pipeline relied on encryption software developed by REvil associates, officially corroborating DarkSide's&nbsp; connections &nbsp;to the prolific criminal outfit.   Coinciding with the development, blockchain analytics firm Elliptic&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;that $7 million in bitcoin held by the DarkSide ransomware group were moved through a series of new wallets, with a small fraction of the amount being transferred with each transfer to make the laundered money more difficult to track and&nbsp; convert &nbsp; the funds &nbsp;into fiat currency through

Two Eastern European nationals have been sentenced in the U.S. for offering "bulletproof hosting" services to cybercriminals, who used the technical infrastructure to distribute malware and attack financial institutions across the country between 2009 to 2015.

The development comes months after Stassi and Shorodumov, along with Aleksandr Grichishkin and Andrei Skvortsov of Russia,&nbsp; pleaded guilty &nbsp;to Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization (RICO) charges earlier this May. The U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) said the other two co-defendants, Grichishkin and Skvortsov, are pending sentencing and face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
REvil, the notorious ransomware gang behind a string of cyberattacks in recent years, appears to have gone off the radar once again, a little over a month after the cybercrime group staged a surprise return following a two-month-long hiatus.  The development, first&nbsp; spotted &nbsp;by Recorded Future's&nbsp; Dmitry Smilyanets , comes after a member affiliated with the REvil operation posted on the XSS hacking forum that unidentified actors had taken control of the gang's Tor payment portal and data leak website.   "The server was compromised and they were looking for me. To be precise, they deleted the path to my hidden service in the&nbsp; torrc file &nbsp;and raised their own so that I would (sic) go there. I checked on others - this was not. Good luck everyone, I'm off," user 0_neday said in the post.  As of writing, it isn't clear exactly who was behind the compromise of REvil's servers, although it wouldn't be entirely surprising if law enforcement agencies played a r

An "aggressive" financially motivated threat actor has been identified as linked to a string of RYUK ransomware attacks since October 2018, while maintaining close partnerships with TrickBot-affiliated threat actors and using a publicly available arsenal of tools such as Cobalt Strike Beacon payloads to interact with victim networks.  Cybersecurity firm Mandiant attributed the intrusions to a Russian-speaking hacker group codenamed FIN12, and previously tracked as&nbsp; UNC1878 , with a disproportionate focus on healthcare organizations with more than $300 million in revenue, among others, including education, financial, manufacturing, and technology sectors, located in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific.  "FIN12 relies on partners to obtain initial access to victim environments," Mandiant researchers&nbsp; said .

Law enforcement agencies have announced the arrest of two "prolific ransomware operators" in Ukraine who allegedly conducted a string of targeted attacks against large industrial entities in Europe and North America since at least April 2020, marking the latest step in combating ransomware incidents.  The joint exercise was undertaken on September 28 by officials from the French National Gendarmerie, the Ukrainian National Police, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), alongside participation from the Europol's European Cybercrime Centre and the INTERPOL's Cyber Fusion Centre.   "The criminals would deploy malware and steal sensitive data from these companies, before encrypting their files," Europol&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a press statement on Monday. "They would then proceed to offer a decryption key in return for a ransom payment of several millions of euros, threatening to leak the stolen data on the dark web should their demands not be met."

Unidentified threat actors breached a server running an unpatched, 11-year-old version of Adobe's ColdFusion 9 software in minutes to remotely take over control and deploy file-encrypting Cring ransomware on the target's network 79 hours after the hack.  The server, which belonged to an unnamed services company, was used to collect timesheet and accounting data for payroll as well as to host a number of virtual machines, according to a report published by Sophos and shared with The Hacker News. The attacks originated from an internet address assigned to the Ukrainian ISP Green Floid.   "Devices running vulnerable, outdated software are low-hanging-fruit for cyberattackers looking for an easy way into a target," Sophos principal researcher Andrew Brandt&nbsp; said .

Europol Busts Major Crime Ring, Arrests Over 100 Online Fraudsters<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/europol-busts-major-cybercrime-ring.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Law enforcement agencies in Italy and Spain have dismantled an organized crime group linked to the Italian Mafia that was involved in online fraud, money laundering, drug trafficking, and property crime, netting the gang about €10 million ($11.7 million) in illegal proceeds in just a year.  "The suspects defrauded hundreds of victims through phishing attacks and other types of online fraud such as SIM swapping and business email compromise before laundering the money through a wide network of money mules and shell companies," Europol&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement published today.&nbsp;   The group operated out of Tenerife, located in Spain's Canary Islands.  The development comes following a year-long sting operation that saw as many as 16 house searches, resulting in 106 arrests — mostly in Spain and Italy — and seizure of electronic devices, 224 credit cards, SIM cards, point-of-sale terminals, a marijuana plantation, and equipment used for its cultivation and distribution. 118 ban

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Tuesday disclosed it fined three intelligence community and military personnel $1.68 million in penalties for their role as cyber-mercenaries working on behalf of a U.A.E.-based cybersecurity company.  The trio in question — Marc Baier, 49, Ryan Adams, 34, and Daniel Gericke, 40 — are accused of "knowingly and willfully combine, conspire, confederate, and agree with each other to commit offenses, "furnishing defense services to persons and entities in the country over a three year period beginning around December 2015 and continuing through November 2019, including developing invasive spyware capable of breaking into mobile devices without any action by the targets.  "The defendants worked as senior managers at a United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.)-based company (U.A.E.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind the REvil ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)&nbsp; staged &nbsp;a surprise return after a two-month hiatus following the widely publicized attack on technology services provider Kaseya on July 4.   Two of the dark web portals, including the gang's Happy Blog data leak site and its payment/negotiation site, have resurfaced online, with the most recent victim added on July 8, five days before the sites&nbsp; mysteriously went off the grid &nbsp;on July 13. It's not immediately clear if REvil is back in the game or if they have launched new attacks.  "Unfortunately, the Happy Blog is back online," Emsisoft threat researcher Brett Callow&nbsp; tweeted &nbsp;on Tuesday.  The development comes a little over two months after a&nbsp; wide-scale supply chain ransomware attack &nbsp;aimed at Kaseya, which saw the Russia-based cybercrime gang encrypting approximately 60 managed service providers (MSPs) and over 1,500 downstream businesses using a zero-day vulnerability in the Kaseya VSA remote manage

Network security solutions provider Fortinet confirmed that a malicious actor had unauthorizedly disclosed VPN login names and passwords associated with 87,000 FortiGate SSL-VPN devices.  "These credentials were obtained from systems that remained unpatched against&nbsp; CVE-2018-13379 &nbsp;at the time of the actor's scan.

Threat actors are capitalizing on the growing popularity of proxyware platforms like Honeygain and Nanowire to monetize their own malware campaigns, once again illustrating how attackers are quick to&nbsp; repurpose and weaponize legitimate platforms &nbsp;to their advantage.  "Malware is currently leveraging these platforms to monetize the internet bandwidth of victims, similar to how malicious cryptocurrency mining attempts to monetize the CPU cycles of infected systems," researchers from Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. "In many cases, these applications are featured in multi-stage, multi-payload malware attacks that provide adversaries with multiple monetization methods."   Proxyware, also called internet-sharing applications, are legitimate services that allow users to carve out a percentage of their internet bandwidth for other devices, often for a fee, through a client application offered by the provider, enabling other customers to access the internet using

Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday took the wraps off four up-and-coming ransomware groups that could pose a serious threat to enterprises and critical infrastructure, as the ripple effect of a recent spurt in ransomware incidents show that attackers are growing more sophisticated and more profitable in extracting payouts from victims.  "While the ransomware crisis appears poised to get worse before it gets better, the cast of cybercrime groups that cause the most damage is constantly changing," Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "Groups sometimes go quiet when they've achieved so much notoriety that they become a priority for law enforcement. Others reboot their operations to make them more lucrative by revising their tactics, techniques and procedures, updating their software and launching marketing campaigns to recruit new affiliates."   The development comes as ransomware attacks are g

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
ShinyHunters, a notorious cybercriminal underground group that's been on a data breach spree since last year, has been observed searching companies' GitHub repository source code for vulnerabilities that can be abused to stage larger scale attacks, an analysis of the hackers' modus operandi has revealed.  "Primarily operating on Raid Forums, the collective's moniker and motivation can partly be derived from their avatar on social media and other forums: a shiny Umbreon Pokémon," Intel 471  researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "As Pokémon players hunt and collect "shiny" characters in the game, ShinyHunters collects and resells user data."  The revelation comes as the&nbsp; average cost of a data breach &nbsp;rose from $3.86 million to $4.24 million, making it the highest average cost in 17 years, with compromised credentials responsible for 20% of the breaches reported by over 500 organizations.

A Nigerian threat actor has been observed attempting to recruit employees by offering them to pay $1 million in bitcoins to deploy Black Kingdom ransomware on companies' networks as part of an insider threat scheme.

"The employee is told they can launch the ransomware physically or remotely. The sender provided two methods to contact them if the employee is interested—an Outlook email account and a Telegram username."   Black Kingdom, also known as DemonWare and DEMON, attracted attention earlier this March when threat actors were found&nbsp; exploiting ProxyLogon flaws &nbsp;impacting Microsoft Exchange Servers to infect unpatched systems with the ransomware strain.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details about an early development version of a nascent ransomware strain called Diavol that has been linked to threat actors behind the infamous TrickBot syndicate.  The latest&nbsp; findings &nbsp;from IBM X-Force show that the ransomware sample shares similarities to other malware that has been attributed to the cybercrime gang, thus establishing a clearer connection between the two.  In early July, Fortinet&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;specifics of an unsuccessful ransomware attack involving Diavol payload targeting one of its customers, highlighting the payload's source code overlaps with that of Conti and its technique of reusing some language from Egregor ransomware in its ransom note.   "As part of a rather unique encryption procedure, Diavol operates using user-mode Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs) without a symmetric encryption algorithm," Fortinet researchers previously said.

Two new ransomware-as-service (RaaS) programs have appeared on the threat radar this month, with one group professing to be a successor to&nbsp; DarkSide &nbsp;and&nbsp; REvil , the two infamous ransomware syndicates that went off the grid following major attacks on Colonial Pipeline and Kaseya over the past few months.  "The project has incorporated in itself the best features of DarkSide, REvil, and LockBit," the operators behind the new BlackMatter group said in their darknet public blog, making promises to not strike organizations in several industries, including healthcare, critical infrastructure, oil and gas, defense, non-profit, and government sectors.   According to Flashpoint, the BlackMatter threat actor registered an account on Russian-language forums XSS and Exploit on July 19, quickly following it up with a post stating they are looking to purchase access to infected corporate networks comprising anywhere between 500 and 15,000 hosts in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the U.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Law enforcement authorities in the Netherlands have&nbsp; arrested &nbsp;two alleged individuals belonging to a Dutch cybercriminal collective who were involved in developing, selling, and renting sophisticated phishing frameworks to other threat actors in what's known as a "Fraud-as-a-Service" operation.  The apprehended suspects, a 24-year-old software engineer and a 15-year-old boy, are said to have been the main developer and seller of the phishing frameworks that were employed to collect login data from bank customers. The attacks primarily singled out users in the Netherlands and Belgium.  Believed to be active since at least 2020, the cybercriminal syndicate has been codenamed " Fraud Family " by cybersecurity firm Group-IB. The frameworks come with phishing kits, tools designed to steal information, and web panels, which allow the fraudsters to interact with the actual phishing site in real time and retrieve the stolen user data.

A U.K. citizen has been arrested in the Spanish town of Estepona over his alleged involvement in the July 2020 hack of Twitter, resulting in the compromise of 130 high-profile accounts.  Joseph O'Connor , 22, has been&nbsp; charged &nbsp;with intentionally accessing a computer without authorization and obtaining information from a protected computer, as well as for making extortive communications. The Spanish National Police made the arrest pursuant to a U.S. warrant.   Besides his role in the Twitter hack, O'Connor is also charged with computer intrusions related to takeovers of TikTok and Snapchat user accounts and cyberstalking an unnamed juvenile victim.  The&nbsp; great Twitter hack &nbsp;of July 15, 2020, emerged as one of the biggest security lapses in the social media platform's history after O'Connor, along with&nbsp; Mason Sheppard, Nima Fazeli, and Graham Ivan Clark , managed to gain access to Twitter's internal tools, abusing it to breach the accounts of politicians, celebritie

REvil, the infamous ransomware cartel behind some of the biggest cyberattacks targeting JBS and Kaseya, has mysteriously disappeared from the dark web, leading to speculations that the criminal enterprise may have been taken down.  Multiple darknet and clearnet sites maintained by the Russia-linked cybercrime syndicate, including the data leak, extortion, and payment portals, remained inaccessible, displaying an error message "Onionsite not found."&nbsp;  The group's&nbsp; Tor network infrastructure &nbsp;on the dark web consists of one data leak blog site and 22 data hosting sites. It's not immediately clear what prompted the infrastructure to be knocked offline.  REvil is one of the most prolific ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups that first appeared on the threat landscape in April 2019. It's an evolution of the&nbsp; GandCrab &nbsp;ransomware, which hit the underground markets in early 2018.  "If REvil has been permanently disrupted, it'll mark the end of a group which ha

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A cyber-espionage group has been observed increasingly targeting Indian government personnel as part of a broad campaign to infect victims with as many as four new custom remote access trojans (RATs), signaling a "boost in their development operations."  Attributed to a group tracked as SideCopy, the intrusions culminate in the deployment of a variety of modular plugins, ranging from file enumerators to browser credential stealers and keyloggers (Xeytan and Lavao), Cisco Talos said in a report published Wednesday.  "Targeting tactics and themes observed in SideCopy campaigns indicate a high degree of similarity to the Transparent Tribe APT (aka APT36) also targeting India," researchers Asheer Malhotra and Justin Thattil&nbsp; said . "These include using decoys posing as operational documents belonging to the military and think tanks and honeytrap-based infections."   First documented in September 2020 by Indian cybersecurity firm Quick Heal,&nbsp; SideCopy &nbsp;has a

Organizations today already have an overwhelming number of dangers and threats to look out for, from spam to phishing attempts to new infiltration and ransomware tactics. There is no chance to rest, since attack groups are constantly looking for more effective means of infiltrating and infecting systems.  Today, there are hundreds of groups devoted to infiltrating almost every industry, constantly devising more sophisticated methods to attack organizations.  It's even more troubling to note that some groups have started to collaborate, creating complex and stealthy tactics that leave even the best security teams scrambling to respond. Such is the case noted by XDR Provider Cynet, as the company observes in its newest Research Webinar ( register here ).  Cynet's research team noted that two of the most infamous attack groups – Lunar Spider and Wizard Spider – have started working together to infect organizations with ransomware.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The cybercrime ring that was apprehended last week in connection with Clop (aka Cl0p) ransomware attacks against dozens of companies in the last few months helped launder money totaling $500 million for several malicious actors through a plethora of illegal activities.  "The group — also known as FANCYCAT — has been running multiple criminal activities: distributing cyber attacks; operating a high-risk exchanger; and laundering money from dark web operations and high-profile cyber attacks such as Cl0p and Petya ransomware," popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance&nbsp; said &nbsp;Thursday.   On June 16, the Ukraine Cyber Police&nbsp; nabbed six individuals &nbsp;in the city of Kyiv, describing the arrests as resulting from an international operation involving law enforcement authorities from Korea, the U.S., and Interpol.  While the bust was seen as a major blow to the operations of the Clop gang, the hackers published earlier this week a fresh batch of confidential employee records stolen from

A Middle Eastern advanced persistent threat (APT) group has resurfaced after a two-month hiatus to target government institutions in the Middle East and global government entities associated with geopolitics in the region in a rash of new campaigns observed earlier this month.  Sunnyvale-based enterprise security firm Proofpoint attributed the activity to a politically motivated threat actor it tracks as TA402 , and known by other monikers such as&nbsp; Molerats &nbsp;and GazaHackerTeam.  The threat actor is believed to be active for a decade, with a history of striking organizations primarily located in Israel and Palestine, and spanning multiple verticals such as technology, telecommunications, finance, academia, military, media, and governments.   The latest wave of attacks commenced with spear-phishing emails written in Arabic and containing PDF attachments that come embedded with a malicious geofenced URL to selectively direct victims to a password-protected archive only if the source IP a

Ukrainian law enforcement officials on Wednesday announced the arrest of the&nbsp; Clop ransomware &nbsp;gang, adding it disrupted the infrastructure employed in attacks targeting victims worldwide since at least 2019.  As part of a joint operation between the National Police of Ukraine and authorities from the Republic of Korea and the U.S., six defendants have been accused of running a double extortion scheme wherein victims refusing to pay a ransom were threatened with the leak of sensitive financial, customer, or personal data stolen from them prior to encrypting the files.   The ransomware attacks amount to $500 million in monetary damages, the National Police&nbsp; said , noting that "law enforcement has managed to shut down the infrastructure from which the virus spreads and block channels for legalizing criminally acquired cryptocurrencies."  Law enforcement officers are said to have conducted 21 searches in the Ukrainian capital and Kyiv region, including the homes of the defendan

As ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure skyrocket, new research shows that threat actors behind such disruptions are increasingly shifting from using email messages as an intrusion route to purchasing access from cybercriminal enterprises that have already infiltrated major targets.  "Ransomware operators often buy access from independent cybercriminal groups who infiltrate major targets and then sell access to the ransomware actors for a slice of the ill-gotten gains," researchers from Proofpoint said in a write-up  shared with The Hacker News.  "Cybercriminal threat groups already distributing banking malware or other trojans may also become part of a ransomware affiliate network."  Besides angling for a piece of the illegal profits, the email and cloud security firm said it is currently tracking at least 10 different threat actors who play the role of "initial access facilitators" to supply affiliates and other cybercrime groups with an e

Even as a massive data breach affecting Air India came to light the previous month, India's flag carrier airline appears to have suffered a separate cyber assault that lasted for a period of at least two months and 26 days, new research has revealed, which attributed the incident with moderate confidence to a Chinese nation-state threat actor called APT41.  Group-IB dubbed the campaign "ColunmTK" based on the names of command-and-control (C2) server domains that were used for facilitating communications with the compromised systems.&nbsp;  "The potential ramifications of this incident for the entire airline industry and carriers that might yet discover traces of ColunmTK in their networks are significant," the Singapore-headquartered threat hunting company&nbsp; said .  While Group-IB alluded that this may have been a supply chain attack targeting SITA, the Swiss aviation information technology company told The Hacker News that they are two different security incidents.

Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday took the wraps off a new cyberespionage group that has been behind a series of targeted attacks against diplomatic entities and telecommunication companies in Africa and the Middle East since at least 2017.  Dubbed " BackdoorDiplomacy ," the campaign involves targeting weak points in internet-exposed devices such as web servers to perform a panoply of cyber hacking activities, including laterally moving across the network to deploy a custom implant called Turian that's capable of exfiltrating sensitive data stored in removable media.   "BackdoorDiplomacy shares tactics, techniques, and procedures with other Asia-based groups. Turian likely represents a next stage evolution of&nbsp; Quarian , the backdoor last observed in use in 2013 against diplomatic targets in Syria and the U.S," said Jean-Ian Boutin, head of threat research at Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET.

Cybercriminals Widely Abusing Excel 4.0 Macro to Distribute Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/cybercriminals-widely-abusing-excel-40.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are increasingly adopting&nbsp; Excel 4.0 documents &nbsp;as an initial stage vector to distribute malware such as&nbsp; ZLoader &nbsp;and Quakbot, according to new research.  The findings come from an analysis of 160,000 Excel 4.0 documents between November 2020 and March 2021, out of which more than 90% were classified as malicious or suspicious.   "The biggest risk for the targeted companies and individuals is the fact that security solutions still have a lot of problems with detecting malicious Excel 4.0 documents, making most of these slip by conventional signature based detections and analyst written YARA rules," researchers from ReversingLabs said in a report&nbsp; published today .   Excel 4.0 macros (XLM), the precursor to Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), is a legacy feature incorporated in Microsoft Excel for backward compatibility reasons. Microsoft warns in its&nbsp; support document &nbsp;that enabling all macros can cause "potentially dangerous code" to run.   The eve

Cybercriminals Using Telegram Messenger to Control ToxicEye Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/cybercriminals-using-telegram-messenger.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Adversaries are increasingly abusing Telegram as a "command-and-control" system to distribute malware into organizations that could then be used to capture sensitive information from targeted systems.  "Even when Telegram is not installed or being used, the system allows hackers to send malicious commands and operations remotely via the instant messaging app," said researchers from cybersecurity firm Check Point , who have identified no fewer than 130 attacks over the past three months that make use of a new multi-functional remote access trojan (RAT) called "ToxicEye."   The use of Telegram for facilitating malicious activities is not new. In September 2019, an information stealer dubbed&nbsp; Masad Stealer &nbsp;was found to plunder information and cryptocurrency wallet data from infected computers using Telegram as an exfiltration channel. Then last year,&nbsp; Magecart groups &nbsp;embraced the same tactic to send stolen payment details from compromised websites back to

Cybercriminals are resorting to search engine poisoning techniques to lure business professionals into seemingly legitimate Google sites that install a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) capable of carrying out a wide range of attacks.

Users attempting to download the alleged document templates are&nbsp; redirected , without their knowledge, to a malicious website that hosts the malware.   "Once the RAT is on the victim's computer and activated, the threat actors can send commands and upload additional malware to the infected system, such as ransomware, a credential stealer, a banking trojan, or simply use the RAT as a foothold into the victim's network," researchers from eSentire&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published on Tuesday.

Law enforcement agencies from the US, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, France, along with Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), announced today the coordinated takedown of Safe-Inet, a popular virtual private network (VPN) service that was used to facilitate criminal activity.  The three domains in question — insorg[.]org, safe-inet[.]com, and safe-inet[.]net — were shut down, and their infrastructure seized as part of a joint investigation called "Operation Nova."  Europol called Safe-Inet a cybercriminals' " favorite ."  A crucial reason for the domains' seizure has been their central role in facilitating ransomware, carrying out web-skimming, spear-phishing, and account takeover attacks.
