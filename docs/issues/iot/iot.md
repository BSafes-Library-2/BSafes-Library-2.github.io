  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Today's enterprise networks are complex environments with different types of wired and wireless devices being connected and disconnected. The current device discovery solutions have been mainly focused on identifying and monitoring servers, workstation PCs, laptops and infrastructure devices such as network firewalls, switches and routers, because the most valuable information assets of organizations are being stored, processed and transferred over those devices, hence making them the prime target of security breaches and intrusions.  However, a new trend has been emerging in the past four years,&nbsp; where attackers have been targeting purpose-built connected devices &nbsp;such as network printers and video conferencing systems as an entry point and data exfiltration route.  These devices cannot be identified properly by the current IT asset discovery solutions for the following main reasons:   Proprietary protocols are often used for managing and monitoring such devices that are not know

Detecting Evasive Malware on IoT Devices Using Electromagnetic Emanations<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/detecting-evasive-malware-on-iot.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have proposed a novel approach that leverages electromagnetic field emanations from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices as a side-channel to glean precise knowledge about the different kinds of malware targeting the embedded systems, even in scenarios where obfuscation techniques have been applied to hinder analysis.  With the rapid adoption of IoT appliances presenting an attractive attack surface for threat actors, in part due to them being equipped with higher processing power and capable of running fully functional operating systems, the latest research aims to improve malware analysis to mitigate potential security risks.  The findings were presented by a group of academics from the Research Institute of Computer Science and Random Systems (IRISA) at the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference ( ACSAC ) held last month.   "[Electromagnetic] emanation that is measured from the device is practically undetectable by the malware," the res

IoT SAFE — An Innovative Way to Secure IoT<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/iot-safe-innovative-way-to-secure-iot.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
By the end of 2021, there will be 12 billion connected IoT devices, and by 2025, that number will rise to 27 billion .  All these devices will be connected to the internet and will send useful data that will make industries, medicine, and cars more intelligent and more efficient.  However, will all these devices be safe? It's worth asking what you can do to prevent (or at least reduce) becoming a victim of a cybercrime such as data theft or other forms of cybercrime in the future?  Will IoT security ever improve?  In recent years, the number of security vulnerabilities related to the Internet of Things has increased significantly.  Let us start at the very beginning — most IoT devices come with default and publicly disclosed passwords. Moreover, the fact is that there are many cheap and low-capacity Internet of Things devices that lack even the most basic security.  And that's not all — security experts are discovering new critical vulnerabilities every day. Numerous IoT devic
