  <summary>Abstract</summary>
SecDevOps is, just like DevOps, a transformational change that organizations undergo at some point during their lifetime. Just like many other big changes, SecDevOps is commonly adopted after a reality check of some kind: a big damaging cybersecurity incident, for example.  A major security breach or, say, consistent problems in achieving development goals signals to organizations that the existing development framework doesn't work and that something new is needed. But what exactly is SecDevOps, why should you embrace it – and how can you do it more easily in practice?  The fundamentals of SecDevOps  By itself, SecDevOps is not just one single improvement. You may see it as a new tool, or set of tools, or perhaps a different mindset. Some might see SecDevOps as a culture. In reality, it's all of those factors wrapped into a new approach to development that's intended to put security first.  SecDevOps rely on highly reproducible scenarios, touching on topics such as system

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
How much time do developers spend actually writing code?  According to recent studies , developers spend more time maintaining, testing and securing existing code than they do writing or improving code. Security vulnerabilities have a bad habit of popping up during the software development process, only to surface after an application has been deployed. The disappointing part is that many of these security flaws and bugs could have been resolved in an earlier stage and there are proper methods and tools to uncover them.  How much time does a developer spend on learning to write a functioning code? And how much is spent on learning about code security? Or learning how not to code?"  Wouldn't it be better to eradicate the problem from the system rather than having it there, and then trying to detect and stop an ongoing attack targeting it?  You can test your secure coding skills with this short&nbsp; self-assessment.  The true cost of bugs  Everyone makes mistakes, even developers.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
So far 2022 confirms that passwords are not dead yet. Neither will they be anytime soon. Even though Microsoft and Apple are championing passwordless authentication methods, most applications and websites will not remove this option for a very long time.  Think about it, internal apps that you do not want to integrate with third-party identity providers, government services, legacy applications, and even SaaS providers may not want to invest in new integrations or restrict their existing authentication methods. After all, online businesses are interested in user traction, and security usually brings friction. For example, a few days ago,&nbsp; Kickstarter sent out millions of password reset &nbsp;emails "simplifying its login process," including for people that used social login without a password.&nbsp;  Though you may be able to remove passwords from many enterprise components, a large portion of third-party providers, government portals, business suppliers, and SaaS services will still

RubyGems Makes Multi-Factor Authentication Mandatory for Top Package Maintainers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/rubygems-makes-multi-factor.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
RubyGems, the official package manager for the Ruby programming language, has become the latest platform to mandate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for popular package maintainers, following the footsteps of&nbsp; NPM &nbsp;and&nbsp; PyPI .  To that end, owners of gems with over 180 million total downloads are mandated to turn on MFA effective August 15, 2022.   "Users in this category who do not have MFA enabled on the UI and API or UI and gem sign-in level will not be able to edit their profile on the web, perform privileged actions (i.e. push and yank gems, or add and remove gem owners), or sign in on the command line until they configure MFA," RubyGems&nbsp; noted .  What's more, gem maintainers who cross 165 million cumulative downloads are expected to receive reminders to turn on MFA until the download count touches the 180 million thresholds, at which point it will be made mandatory.  The development is seen as an attempt by package ecosystems to&nbsp; bolster the software supply chain

Credential Theft Is (Still) A Top Attack Method<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/credential-theft-is-still-top-attack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Credential theft is clearly still a problem. Even after years of warnings, changing password requirements, and multiple forms of authentication,&nbsp; password &nbsp;stealing remains a top attack method used by cyber criminals.  The latest&nbsp; report &nbsp;from the Ponemon Institute shares that 54% of security incidents were caused by credential theft, followed by ransomware and DDoS attacks. 59% of organizations aren't revoking credentials that are no longer needed, meaning passwords can go unattended and dormant like a sitting duck (similar to what happened with Colonial Pipeline). And&nbsp; Verizon's Data Breach Investigations Report &nbsp;cites that nearly 50% of all data breaches were caused by stolen credentials.  The stats don't lie. Cybercriminals are advancing, there's no doubt, but if there's an option to take the path of least resistance, they'll take it. Too often, that means compromising passwords and exploiting vulnerable access points.&nbsp;  Credential Theft and Critical Access

The Truth About False Positives in Security<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/the-truth-about-false-positives-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
TL;DR: As weird as it might sound, seeing a few false positives reported by a security scanner is probably a good sign and certainly better than seeing none. Let's explain why.  Introduction  False positives have made a somewhat unexpected appearance in our lives in recent years. I am, of course, referring to the COVID-19 pandemic, which required massive testing campaigns in order to control the spread of the virus. For the record, a false positive is a result that appears positive (for COVID-19 in our case), where it is actually negative (the person is not infected). More commonly, we speak of false alarms.  In computer security, we are also often confronted with false positives. Ask the security team behind any SIEM what their biggest operational challenge is, and chances are that false positives will be mentioned. A recent&nbsp; report &nbsp;estimates that as much as 20% of all the alerts received by security professionals are false positives, making it a big source of fatigue.  Yet the

A few days ago, a friend and I were having a rather engaging conversation that sparked my excitement. We were discussing my prospects of becoming a red teamer as a natural career progression. The reason I got stirred up is not that I want to change either my job or my position, as I am a happy camper being part of Cymulate's blue team.  What upset me was that my friend could not grasp the idea that I wanted to keep working as a blue teamer because, as far as he was concerned, the only natural progression is to move to the red team.&nbsp;  Red teams include many roles ranging from penetration testers to attackers and exploit developers. These roles attract most of the buzz, and the many certifications revolving around these roles (OSCP, OSEP, CEH) make them seem fancy. Movies usually make hackers the heroes, while typically ignoring the defending side, the complexities and challenges of blue teamers' roles are far less known.  While blue teams' defending roles might not sound as

Imagine this: a company-wide lockout to the company CRM, like Salesforce, because the organization's external admin attempts to disable MFA for themselves. They don't think to consult with the security team and don't consider the security implications, only the ease which they need for their team to use their login.&nbsp;  This CRM, however, defines MFA as a top-tier security setting; for example, Salesforce has a "High Assurance Login Value" configuration and immediately locks out all users as a safety precaution. The entire organization hits a standstill and is frustrated and confused.&nbsp;  Deeply concerning, this is not a one-off event, admins for business-critical SaaS apps often sit outside the security department and have profound control. Untrained and not focused on security measures, these admins are working towards their departmental KPIs.

MSSPs must find ways to balance the need to please existing customers, add new ones, and deliver high-margin services against their internal budget constraints and the need to maintain high employee morale. In an environment where there are thousands of potential alerts each day and cyberattacks are growing rapidly in frequency and sophistication, this isn't an easy balance to maintain.  Customers want airtight security, but adding dozens of security tools to scan for and respond to any potential attack often means that specific analysts become experts in specific tools. It's left to the whole team to manually correlate their findings to discover and respond to multi-layered attacks, and hackers are always finding ways to exploit the gaps in coverage. This is a no-win situation where the analysts are frustrated, customers are dissatisfied, and costs can easily run out of control.  To win in the marketplace, MSSPs must find ways to make their teams highly efficient while driving higher

The financial services industry has always been at the forefront of technology adoption, but the 2020 pandemic accelerated the widespread of mobile banking apps, chat-based customer service, and other digital tools.&nbsp; Adobe's 2022 FIS Trends Report ,&nbsp; for instance, found that more than half of the financial services and insurance firms surveyed experienced a notable increase in digital/mobile visitors in the first half of 2020. The same report found that four out of ten financial executives say that digital and mobile channels account for more than half of their sales – a trend that's only expected to continue in the next few years.  As financial institutions expand their digital footprint, they have more opportunities to better serve their customers – but are also more exposed to security threats. Every new tool increases the attack surface. A higher number of potential security gaps, may potentially lead to a higher number of security breaches.  According to the &nbsp;Cisco CISO B

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has officially resumed blocking Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros by default across Office apps, weeks after temporarily announcing plans to roll back the change.  "Based on our review of customer feedback, we've made updates to both our&nbsp; end user &nbsp;and our&nbsp; IT admin &nbsp;documentation to make clearer what options you have for different scenarios," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an update on July 20.  Earlier this February, Microsoft publicized its plans to disable macros by default in Office applications such as Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, and Word as a way to prevent threat actors from abusing the feature to deliver malware.  It's a known fact that a majority of the damaging cyberattacks today leverage email-based phishing lures to spread bogus documents containing malicious macros as a primary vector for initial access.   "Macros can add a lot of functionality to Office, but they are often used by people with bad intentions to distribute malware to

Google on Thursday said it's backtracking on a&nbsp; recent change &nbsp;that removed the app permissions list from the Google Play Store for Android across both the mobile app and the web.  "Privacy and transparency are core values in the Android community," the Android Developers team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets. "We heard your feedback that you find the app permissions section in Google Play useful, and we've decided to reinstate it. The app permissions section will be back shortly."  To that end, in addition to showcasing the new Data safety section that offers users a simplified summary of an app's data collection, processing, and security practices, Google also intends to highlight all the permissions required by the app to make sense of its "ability to access specific restricted data and actions."   The reinstatement comes as the internet giant moved to swap out the apps permission section with the newer Data safety labels last week ahead of the

Python has its pros and cons, but it's nonetheless used extensively. For example, Python is frequently used in data crunching tasks even when there are more appropriate languages to choose from.  Why? Well, Python is relatively easy to learn. Someone with a science background can pick up Python much more quickly than, say, C. However, Python's inherent approachability also creates a couple of problems.  Whenever Python is updated, it means a big refactoring workload, which often gets dealt with poorly – or not at all. That leads to poor performance and security vulnerabilities. But maybe there is a better way: a tool to keep your Python tasks running smoothly and securely day in, day out. Let's take a look.  It's slow, but it does the job  Python isn't the fastest language around, but despite its comparative disadvantages, you'll often see it used for intensive data crunching operations. Think machine learning, computer vision, or even pure math in high-perform

The New Weak Link in SaaS Security: Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/the-new-weak-link-in-saas-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Typically, when threat actors look to infiltrate an organization's SaaS apps, they look to SaaS app misconfigurations as a means of entry. However, employees now use their personal devices, whether their phones or laptops, etc., to get their jobs done. If the device's hygiene is not up to par, it increases the risk for the organization and widens the attack surface for bad actors. And so, Endpoint (Device) Protection — through EDR, XDR, and vulnerability management solutions – has arisen as a critical factor in SaaS Security.  The challenge in remediating the threats posed by endpoints and devices lies in the ability to correlate between the SaaS app users, their roles, and permissions with their associated devices' compliance and integrity levels. This end-to-end approach is what's needed for the organization to implement a holistic, zero-trust approach for their SaaS Security.&nbsp;  Not a simple feat, however, automated SaaS Security Posture Management solutions, like Ad

The Great Resignation – or the Great Reshuffle as some are calling it – and the growing skills gap have been dominating headlines lately. But these issues aren't new to the cybersecurity industry. While many are just now hearing about employee burnout, security teams have faced reality and serious consequences of burnout for years.&nbsp;  One of the biggest culprits? Alert overload.&nbsp;  The average security team gets tens of thousands of alerts&nbsp; each day . Many analysts feel like they can't get their heads above water…and are starting to give up. This looks like physical burnout and even apathy. Surveys found that some security analysts feel so overwhelmed they ignore alerts and even walk away from their computers.&nbsp;  In fact, these surveys found that&nbsp; 70% of security teams &nbsp;feel emotionally overwhelmed by alerts, and more than&nbsp; 55% of security professionals &nbsp;don't feel fully confident that they can prioritize and respond to every alert that really does need attention.&nbsp;  Sadly, th

New Study Finds Most Enterprise Vendors Failing to Mitigate Speculative Execution Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/new-study-finds-most-enterprise-vendors.html"> Full Text</a>

With speculative execution attacks remaining a stubbornly persistent vulnerability ailing modern processors, new research has highlighted an "industry failure" to adopting mitigations released by AMD and Intel, posing a firmware supply chain threat.  Dubbed&nbsp; FirmwareBleed &nbsp;by Binarly, the information leaking assaults stem from the continued exposure of microarchitectural attack surfaces on the part of enterprise vendors either as a result of not correctly incorporating the fixes or only using them partially.  "The impact of such attacks is focused on disclosing the content from privileged memory (including protected by virtualization technologies) to obtain sensitive data from processes running on the same processor (CPU)," the firmware protection firm&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "Cloud environments can have a greater impact when a physical server can be shared by multiple users or legal entities."  In recent years, implementations of

Google Removes "App Permissions" List from Play Store for New "Data Safety" Section<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/google-removes-app-permissions-list.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Following the launch of a new "Data safety" section for the Android app on the Play Store, Google appears to be readying to remove the app permissions list from both the mobile app and the web.  The change was&nbsp; highlighted &nbsp;by Esper's Mishaal Rahman earlier this week.  The&nbsp; Data safety &nbsp;section, which Google began rolling out in late April 2022, is the company's answer to Apple's Privacy Nutrition Labels in iOS, allowing users to have a unified view of an app's data collection and processing practices.   To that end, third-party app developers are required to furnish the required details by July 20, 2022. With this deadline now approaching next week, the tech giant has moved to entirely remove the permissions section.  The decision also appears to be a hasty one, as a number of popular apps such as Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Amazon (including Amazon Prime Video), DuckDuckGo, Discord, and PhonePe are yet to populate their Data safety sections.

New survey reveals lack of staff, skills, and resources driving smaller teams to outsource security.  As business begins its return to normalcy (however "normal" may look), CISOs at small and medium-size enterprises (500 – 10,000 employees) were asked to share their&nbsp; cybersecurity challenges and priorities , and their responses were compared the results with those of a similar survey from 2021.

This year that number has leapt to 85%. In contrast, last year 45% were using network detection and response (NDR) tools, while this year just 6% employ NDR. Compared to 2021, double the number of CISOs and their organizations are seeing the value of extended detection and response (XDR) tools, which combine EDR with integrated network signals.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Although there is a greater awareness of cybersecurity threats than ever before, it is becoming increasingly difficult for IT departments to get their security budgets approved. Security budgets seem to shrink each year and IT pros are constantly being asked to do more with less. Even so, the situation may not be hopeless. There are some things that IT pros can do to improve the chances of getting their security budgets approved.  &nbsp;Presenting the Problem in a Compelling Way  If you want to get your proposed security budget approved, you will need to present security problems in a compelling way. While those who are in charge of the organization's finances are likely aware of the need for good security, they have probably also seen enough examples of "a security solution in search of a problem" to make them skeptical of security spending requests. If you want to persuade those who control the money, then you will need to convince them of three things:   You are trying to

Often, organizations think of firewall security as a one-and-done type of solution. They install firewalls, then assume that they are "good to go" without investigating whether or not these solutions are actually protecting their systems in the best way possible. "Set it and forget it!"  Instead of just relying on firewalls and assuming that they will always protect their businesses from cyber risk, executives need to start asking deeper questions about them. As with most areas of business, it's important to take a critical look at each solution that your organization relies on for security. So, let's break down a few questions that you and your team should be asking about firewall security to get a more accurate view into your network defense posture.  1 — What does your team's&nbsp;firewall knowledge look like?   In order to properly service and upkeep firewalls, your team needs to have at least a baseline knowledge of how firewalls operate. It's espe

Avoiding Death by a Thousand Scripts: Using Automated Content Security Policies<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/avoiding-death-by-thousand-scripts.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Businesses know they need to secure their client-side scripts. Content security policies (CSPs) are a great way to do that. But CSPs are cumbersome. One mistake and you have a potentially significant client-side security gap. Finding those gaps means long and tedious hours (or days) in manual code reviews through thousands of lines of script on your web applications. Automated content security policies can help streamline the code review process by first identifying all first- and third-party scripts and the assets they access, and then generating an appropriate content security policy to help better secure the client-side attack surface.   There are few developers or AppSec professionals who claim to enjoy deploying CSPs. First, the CSP has to work for the specific web application. Then the team needs to make sure it provides the appropriate level of protection. The CSP also can't conflict with any existing widgets or plugins (or the decision must be made to not deploy the CSP or dea

(2) Employees are granting 3rd party app access to core SaaS apps that pose potential threats to the company. (3) These SaaS apps are accessed by different devices without their device hygiene score even being checked.&nbsp;  1 — Misconfiguration Management   It's not an easy task to have every app setting properly configured — at all times. The challenge lies within how burdensome this responsibility is — each app has tens or hundreds of security settings to configure, in addition to thousands of user roles and permission in a typical enterprise, compounded by the many compliance industry

Progress powers technology forward. But progress also has a cost: by adding new capabilities and features, the developer community is constantly adjusting the building blocks. That includes the fundamental languages used to code technology solutions.  When the building blocks change, the code behind the technology solution must change too. It's a challenging and time-consuming exercise that drains resources. But what if there's an alternative?  The problem: reading code someone else wrote  Let's take a step back and take a look at one of the fundamental challenges in development: editing someone else's code. Editing code you just wrote, or wrote a couple of weeks ago, is just fine. But editing your own code written years ago – never mind someone else's code - that's a different story.  In-house code style rules can help but there are always odd naming conventions for variables and functions, or unusual choices for algorithms. Arguably, a programmer's abilit

July may positively disrupt and adrenalize the old-fashioned Dynamic Application Security Scanning (DAST) market, despite the coming holiday season. The pathbreaking innovation comes from ImmuniWeb, a global application security company, well known for, among other things, its free&nbsp; Community Edition &nbsp;that processes over 100,000 daily security scans of web and mobile apps.&nbsp;  Today, ImmuniWeb announced that its new product –&nbsp; Neuron &nbsp;– is publicly available. This would be another boring press release by a software vendor, but the folks from ImmuniWeb managed to add a secret sauce that you will unlikely be able to resist tasting. The DAST scanning service is flexibly available as a SaaS, and unsurprisingly contains all fashionable features commonly advertised by competitors on the rapidly growing global market, spanning from native CI/CD integrations to advanced configuration of security scanning, pre-programmed or authenticated testing.&nbsp;  But the groundbreaking feature is Neuron's

Change is a part of life, and nothing stays the same for too long, even with hacking groups, which are at their most dangerous when working in complete silence. The notorious REvil&nbsp; ransomware &nbsp;gang, linked to the infamous JBS and Kaseya, has resurfaced three months after the arrest of its members in Russia.  The Russian domestic intelligence service, the FSB, had caught 14 people from the gang. In this apprehension, the 14 members of the gang were found in possession of 426 million roubles, $600,000, 500,000 euros, computer equipment, and 20 luxury cars were brought to justice.  REvil Ransomware Gang- The Context  The financially-motivated cybercriminal threat group Gold Southfield controlled ransomware group known as REvil emerged in 2019 and spread like wildfire after extorting $11 million from the meat-processor JBS.  REvil would incentivize its affiliates to carry out cyberattacks for them by giving a percentage of the ransom pay-outs to those who help with infiltration activitie

Shadow IT refers to the practice of users deploying unauthorized technology resources in order to circumvent their IT department. Users may resort to using shadow IT practices when they feel that existing IT policies are too restrictive or get in the way of them being able to do their jobs effectively.  An old school phenomenon&nbsp;  Shadow IT is not new. There have been countless examples of widespread shadow IT use over the years. In the early 2000s, for example, many organizations were reluctant to adopt Wi-Fi for fear that it could undermine their security efforts. However, users wanted the convenience of wireless device usage and often deployed wireless access points without the IT department's knowledge or consent.  The same thing happened when the iPad first became popular. IT departments largely prohibited iPads from being used with business data because of the inability to apply group policy settings and other security controls to the devices. Even so, users often ignored IT and

Your smartphone is your daily companion. The chances are that most of our activities rely on them, from ordering food to booking medical appointments. However, the threat landscape always reminds us how vulnerable smartphones can be.&nbsp;  Consider the recent&nbsp; discovery by Oversecured , a security startup. These experts observed the dynamic code loading and its potential dangers. Why is this a problem? Well, the Google app uses code that does not come integrated with the app itself. Okay, this might sound confusing, but it all works in favor of optimizing certain processes. Thus, Google exploits code libraries pre-installed on Android phones to reduce their download size. In fact, many Android apps use this trick to optimize the storage space needed to run.&nbsp;  As revealed by Oversecured, perpetrators could compromise this retrieval of code from libraries. Instead of Google obtaining code from a reliable source, it could be tricked into taking code from malicious apps operating on the devic

Just before last Christmas, in a first-of-a-kind case, JPMorgan was fined $200M for employees using non-sanctioned applications for communicating about financial strategy. No mention of insider trading, naked shorting, or any malevolence. Just employees circumventing regulation using, well, Shadow IT. Not because they tried to obfuscate or hide anything, simply because it was a convenient tool that they preferred over any other sanctioned products (which JPMorgan certainly has quite a few of.)&nbsp;  Visibility into unknown and unsanctioned applications has been required by regulators and also recommended by the Center for Internet Security community for a long time. Yet it seems like new and better approaches are still in demand. Gartner has identified External Attack Surface Management, Digital Supply Chain Risk, and Identity Threat Detection as the top three trends to focus on in 2022, all of which are closely intertwined with Shadow IT.

When it comes to keeping SaaS stacks secure, IT and security teams need to be able to streamline the detection and remediation of misconfigurations in order to best protect their SaaS stack from threats. However, while companies adopt more and more apps, their increase in SaaS security tools and staff has lagged behind, as found in the&nbsp; 2022 SaaS Security Survey Report.&nbsp;  The survey report, completed by Adaptive Shield in conjunction with Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), dives into how CISOs today are managing the growing SaaS app attack surface and the steps they are taking to secure their organizations.&nbsp;  The report finds that at least 43% of organizations have experienced a security incident as a result of a SaaS misconfiguration; however, with another 20% being "unsure," the real number could be&nbsp; as high as 63% . These numbers are particularly striking when compared to the 17% of organizations experiencing security incidents due to an IaaS misconfiguration.&nbsp;  Bearing this

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ransomware has been a thorn in the side of cybersecurity teams for years. With the move to remote and hybrid work, this insidious threat has become even more of a challenge for&nbsp; organizations everywhere.  2021 was a case study in ransomware due to the wide variety of attacks, significant financial and economic impact, and diverse ways that organizations responded.&nbsp; These attacks &nbsp;should be seen as a lesson that can inform future security strategies to mitigate ransomware risk. As an organization continues to evolve, so should its security strategy.  The Remote Environment Is Primed for Ransomware  With organizations continuing to support remote and hybrid work, they no longer have the visibility and control they once had inside their perimeter. Attackers are&nbsp; exploiting this weakness&nbsp; and profiting. Here are three reasons they're able to do so:  Visibility and control have changed.&nbsp; Most organizations now have employees working from anywhere. These employees expect seamless access to

It was first the pandemic that changed the usual state of work - before, it was commuting, working in the office &amp; coming home for most corporate employees. Then, when we had to adapt to the self-isolation rules, the work moved to home offices, which completely changed the workflow for many businesses. As the pandemic went down, we realized success never relied on where the work was done. Whether your office is your kitchen, your bedroom, a nearby cafe, or your actual workplace in an office building, it all comes down to the fact that job success has nothing to do with your location.&nbsp;  The role of the office in the hybrid era is also changing - according to the research conducted by&nbsp; PwC , it now serves the purpose of collaborating with team members and building relationships. From an employee's side, it sounds pretty logical and obvious.&nbsp;  However, if we look at hybrid work with the eyes of an employer, things get complicated. How does one make sure corporate devices &amp; da

Breaches don't just happen to large enterprises. Threat actors are increasingly targeting small businesses. In fact,&nbsp; 43% &nbsp;of data breaches involved small to medium-sized businesses. But there is a glaring discrepancy. Larger businesses typically have the budget to keep their lights on if they are breached.

The most recent evolution of cybersecurity technology is extended detection and response (XDR).  There's no doubt you've heard of it.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In 2017, The Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC) published a set of mitigation strategies that were designed to help organizations to protect themselves against cyber security incidents. These strategies, which became known as&nbsp; the Essential Eight , are designed specifically for use on Windows networks, although variations of these strategies are commonly applied to other platforms.  What is the Essential Eight?&nbsp;  The Essential Eight is essentially a cyber security framework that is made up of objectives and controls (with each objective including multiple controls). Initially, the Australian government only mandated that companies adhere to four of the security controls that were included in the first objective. Starting in June of 2022 however, all 98 non-corporate Commonwealth entities (NCCEs) are going to be&nbsp; required to comply with the entire framework .  Non-Australians take note&nbsp;  Although the Essential Eight is specific to Australia, organizations outside of Australia shou

Common cybercriminals are a menace, there's no doubt about it – from bedroom hackers through to ransomware groups, cybercriminals are causing a lot of damage. But both the tools used and the threat posed by common cybercriminals pale in comparison to the tools used by more professional groups such as the famous hacking groups and state-sponsored groups.  In fact, these tools can prove almost impossible to detect – and guard against. BVP47 is a case in point. In this article, we'll outline how this powerful state-sponsored malware has been quietly circulating for years, how it so cleverly disguises itself, and explain what that means for cybersecurity in the enterprise.  Background story behind BVP47  It's a long story, fit for a spy novel. Earlier this year, a Chinese cybersecurity research group called Pangu Lab published an in-depth, 56-page report covering a piece of malicious code that the research group decided to call BVP47 (because BVP was the most common string in

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
"Shifting (security)" left approach in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) means starting security earlier in the process. As organizations realized that software never comes out perfectly and are riddled with many exploitable holes, bugs, and business logic vulnerabilities that require going back to fix and patch, they understood that building secure software requires incorporating and consolidating numerous resources.  This conclusion led DevOps and R&amp;D leaders to become proactive, acquiring technology to find and close these gaps in advance, with the aim of reducing the cost and effort while improving the quality of their outcomes.&nbsp;  With emerging comprehensive&nbsp; continuous security validation technology , the demonstrated benefits of 'shifting left' as a fundamental part of SDLC can now be applied to your cybersecurity program, with results far exceeding the purely technical aspects of security posture management.&nbsp;  At the development level, the conceptuali

As many as 47,337 malicious plugins have been uncovered on 24,931 unique websites, out of which 3,685 plugins were sold on legitimate marketplaces, netting the attackers $41,500 in illegal revenues.  The findings come from a new tool called&nbsp; YODA &nbsp;that aims to detect rogue WordPress plugins and track down their origin, according to an 8-year-long study conducted by a group of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology.  "Attackers impersonated benign plugin authors and spread malware by distributing pirated plugins," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new paper titled " Mistrust Plugins You Must ."   "The number of malicious plugins on websites has steadily increased over the years, and malicious activity peaked in March 2020. Shockingly, 94% of the malicious plugins installed over those 8 years are still active today."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of the mobile threat landscape in 2022 shows that Spain and Turkey are the most targeted countries for malware campaigns, even as a mix of new and existing banking trojans are increasingly targeting Android devices to conduct on-device fraud (ODF).  Other frequently targeted countries include Poland, Australia, the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Italy, France, and Portugal.  "The most worrying leitmotif is the increasing attention to On-Device Fraud (ODF)," Dutch cybersecurity company ThreatFabric&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "Just in the first five months of 2022 there has been an increase of more than 40% in malware families that abuse Android OS to perform fraud using the device itself, making it almost impossible to detect them using traditional fraud scoring engines."   Hydra ,&nbsp; FluBot &nbsp;(aka Cabassous),&nbsp; Cerberus ,&nbsp; Octo , and&nbsp; ERMAC &nbsp;accounted for the most active banking trojans based on the number of samples observed during the same

It's no secret that 3rd party apps can boost productivity, enable remote and hybrid work and are overall, essential in building and scaling a company's work processes.&nbsp;  An innocuous process much like clicking on an attachment was in the earlier days of email, people don't think twice when connecting an app they need with their Google workspace or M365 environment, etc. Simple actions that users take, from creating an email to updating a contact in the CRM, can result in several other automatic actions and notifications in the connected platforms.&nbsp;  As seen in the image below, the OAuth mechanism makes it incredibly easy to interconnect apps and many don't consider what the possible ramifications could be. When these apps and other add-ons for SaaS platforms ask for permissions' access, they are usually granted without a second thought, presenting more opportunities for bad actors to gain access to a company's data.

Security incidents occur. It's not a matter of "if," but of "when." That's why you implemented security products and procedures to optimize the incident response (IR) process.  However, many security pros who are doing an excellent job in handling incidents find effectively communicating the ongoing process with their management a much more challenging task.  Feels familiar?  In many organizations, leadership is not security savvy, and they aren't interested in the details regarding all the bits and bytes in which the security pro masters.&nbsp;  Luckily, there is a template that security leads can use when presenting to management. It's called the&nbsp; IR Reporting for Management template , providing CISOs and CIOs with a clear and intuitive tool to report both the ongoing IR process and its conclusion.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Containers revolutionized the development process, acting as a cornerstone for DevOps initiatives, but containers bring complex security risks that are not always obvious. Organizations that don't mitigate these risks are vulnerable to attack.&nbsp;  In this article, we outline how containers contributed to agile development, which unique security risks containers bring into the picture – and what organizations can do to secure containerized workloads, going beyond DevOps to achieve&nbsp; DevSecOps .  Why did containers catch on so fast?  Containers are, in many ways, the evolution of virtualization. The goal was to speed up the development process, creating a more agile route from development through to testing and implementation – a method that's more lightweight than using full-blown virtual machines, anyway.  At the core of this issue is application compatibility, as applications require certain versions of libraries – which could clash with the requirements of other applications. Container

Traditional businesses migrating to the cloud need robust information security mechanisms.&nbsp; Gartner predicts&nbsp; that more than 95% of new digital workloads will continue to be deployed on cloud-native platforms by 2025.  Robust&nbsp; cloud data security &nbsp;is imperative for businesses adopting rapid digital transformation to the cloud. While a traditional hosting model could be considered more secure, not all organizations are receptive to relinquishing control over their infrastructure or applications by relying on a cloud provider at an increased risk of data theft from a cyberattack done by an outsider.  Having said so, let's try to understand the vital part.  What is Cloud Data Security?&nbsp;  Cloud data security entails securing data, whether at rest or in motion, on cloud-based infrastructure, applications, etc., against cyber threats like data breaches, unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, etc.  This includes the technologies, policies, controls, and services to protect cloud-based system

Are you aware of fake clickjacking bug bounty reports? If not, you should be. This article will get you up to speed and help you to stay alert.  What are clickjacking bug bounty reports?  If we start by breaking up the term into its component parts, a bug bounty is a program offered by an organization, in which individuals are rewarded for finding and reporting software bugs. These programs are often used by companies as a cost-effective way to find and fix software vulnerabilities, thereby improving the security of their products. They also help to build goodwill with the security community.&nbsp;  For the bounty hunters (or white hat hackers), they have an opportunity to earn money and recognition for their skills.&nbsp;  Clickjacking is a malicious technique used to trick users into clicking on something that they think is safe, but is actually harmful. For example, a hacker could create a fake button that looks like the "like" button on a social media site. When users click on it,

With the ongoing conflict in Eurasia, cyberwarfare is inevitably making its presence felt. The fight is not only being fought on the fields. There is also a big battle happening in cyberspace. Several cyber-attacks have been reported over the past months.  Notably, cyber attacks backed by state actors are becoming prominent. There have been reports of a rise of ransomware and other malware attacks such as&nbsp; Cyclops Blink ,&nbsp; HermeticWiper , and&nbsp; BlackCat . These target businesses as well as government institutions and nonprofit organizations. There have been cases of several attempts to shut down online communications and IT infrastructure.  The ongoing list of&nbsp; significant cyber incidents &nbsp;curated by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) shows that the number of major incidents in January 2022 is 100% higher compared to the same period in the previous year.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The mass adoption of cloud infrastructure is fully justified by innumerable advantages. As a result, today, organizations' most sensitive business applications, workloads, and data are in the cloud.  Hackers, good and bad, have noticed that trend and effectively evolved their attack techniques to match this new tantalizing target landscape. With threat actors' high reactivity and adaptability, it is recommended to assume that organizations are under attack and that some user accounts or applications might already have been compromised.  Finding out exactly which assets are put at risk through compromised accounts or breached assets requires mapping potential attack paths across a comprehensive map of all the relationships between assets.&nbsp;  Today, mapping potential attack paths is performed with scanning tools such as AzureHound or AWSPX. Those are graph-based tools enabling the visualization of assets and resources relationships within the related cloud service provider.  By r

With the growth in digital transformation, the API management market is set to grow&nbsp; by more than 30%&nbsp; &nbsp;by the year 2025 as more businesses build web APIs and consumers grow to rely on them for everything from mobile apps to customized digital services.  As part of strategic business planning, an API helps generate revenue by allowing customers access to the functionality of a website or computer program through custom applications.  As more and more businesses are implementing APIs, the risk of API attacks increases.  By 2022, Gartner predicted that API (Application Programming Interface) attacks would become the most common attack vector for enterprise web applications.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actor groups like Wizard Spider and Sandworm have been wreaking havoc over the past few years – developing and deploying cybercrime tools like Conti, Trickbot, and Ryuk ransomware. Most recently, Sandworm (suspected to be a Russian cyber-military unit) unleashed cyberattacks against Ukranian infrastructure targets.  To ensure cybersecurity providers are battle ready, MITRE Engenuity uses real-world attack scenarios and tactics implemented by threat groups to test security vendors' capabilities to protect against threats – the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Evaluation. Each vendor's detections and capabilities are assessed within the context of the&nbsp; MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework.  This year, they used the tactics seen in Wizard Spider and Sandworm's during their evaluation simulations. And MITRE Engenuity didn't go easy on these participating vendors. As mentioned before – the stakes are too high, and risk is growing.  The 2022 results overview  To think about it simply, this MITRE ATT&amp;CK Ev

In what's yet another act of sabotage, the developer behind the popular "node-ipc" NPM package shipped a new version to protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine, raising concerns about security in the open-source and the&nbsp; software supply chain .  Affecting versions 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 of the library, the changes introduced undesirable behavior by its maintainer RIAEvangelist, targeting users with IP addresses located either in Russia or Belarus, and wiping arbitrary file contents and replacing it with a heart emoji.  Node-ipc is a prominent&nbsp; node module &nbsp;used for local and remote inter-process communication with support for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It has over 1.1 million weekly downloads.   "A very clear abuse and a critical supply chain security incident will occur for any system on which this NPM package will be called upon, if that matches a geo-location of either Russia or Belarus," Synk researcher Liran Tal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As much as threat mitigation is to a degree a specialist task involving cybersecurity experts, the day to day of threat mitigation often still comes down to systems administrators. For these sysadmins it's not an easy task, however. In enterprise IT, sysadmins teams have a wide remit but limited resources.  For systems administrators finding the time and resources to mitigate against a growing and constantly moving threat is challenging. In this article, we outline the difficulties implied by enterprise threat mitigation, and explain why automated, purpose-built mitigation tools are the way forward.  Threat management is an overwhelming task  There is a range of specialists that work within threat management, but the practical implementation of threat management strategies often comes down to systems administrators. Whether it's patch management, intrusion detection or remediation after an attack, sysadmins typically bear the brunt of the work.  It's an impossible task, gi

There's something about craftsmanship. It's personal, its artistry, and it can be incredibly effective in achieving its goals. On the other hand, mass-market production can be effective in other ways, through speed, efficiency, and cost savings.  The story of data centers is one of going from craftsmanship – where every individual machine is a pet project, maintained with great care – to mass production with big server farms where individual units are completely disposable.  In this article, we take a look at how data centers have changed shape over the decades. We examine the implications for data center workloads, and for the people that run them – who have now lost their pet systems. We'll also review the cybersecurity implications of the new data center landscape.

If you haven't heard of the&nbsp; term , you will soon enough. SOC 2, meaning  System and Organization Controls 2 , is an auditing procedure developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA). Having SOC 2 compliance means you have implemented organizational controls and practices that provide assurance for the safeguarding and security of client data. In other words, you have to show (e.g., document and demonstrate) that you are acting in good faith with other people's information. In its simplest definition, it's a report card from an auditor.&nbsp;  At Rewind, before SOC 2, we had some processes in place, such as change management procedures for when emergency fixes need to be released to production quickly. But after beginning our SOC 2 journey we realized that we did not have a great way to track the reasoning behind a required emergency change, and this was required for our SOC 2 audit. So we worked with our auditor to set up a continuous auditing system for these requests, p

XDR: Redefining the game for MSSPs serving SMBs and SMEs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/xdr-redefining-game-for-mssps-serving.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
SMBs and SMEs are increasingly turning to MSSPs to secure their businesses because they simply do not have the resources to manage an effective security technology stack. However, it's also challenging for MSSPs to piece together an effective but manageable security technology stack to protect their clients, especially at an affordable price point.  This is where Extended Detection and Response (XDR) comes in and can help MSSPs boost their profitability from SMB and SME and improve their protections. XDR is heating up within the MSSP market as these security service providers stand to gain tremendous financial and operational benefits from this nascent technology. XDR promises far better security outcomes at a lower cost than the current security stack approaches most MSSPs currently have in place.  One sticky point that keeps arising in the XDR discussion has to do with the different technology approaches XDR providers rely upon to deliver platform capabilities. Most of us have heard

How Can You Leave Log4J in 2021?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/how-can-you-leave-log4j-in-2021.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
With the last month of 2021 dominated by the log4J vulnerabilities discovery, publication, and patches popping up in rapid succession, odds are you have patched your system against Log4J exploitation attempts. At least some systems, if not all. You might even have installed the latest patch – at the time of writing, that is 2.17.1, but, if the last rapid patching cycle persists, it might have changed by the time this is published.  In the meantime, defenders might have been working overtime to plug Log4J born security gaps, but so did cyber-attackers. Log4J's well-deserved fame also alerted cyber-attackers to a potential entry pathway into their target. And, while log4J will hopefully vanish from the headlines,&nbsp; cyber-attackers are likely to continue trying to exploit it &nbsp;in the hope of finding unpatched or incompletely patched targets.  As human error still accounts&nbsp; for 95% of all security breaches , cyber-attackers actively rely on these human errors to exploit them and take advant

2022 Cybersecurity Predictions from Lookout: Work From Anywhere Ends On-Premises Security<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/2022-cybersecurity-predictions-from.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Lookout , an endpoint-to-cloud cyber security company, have put together their cyber security predictions for 2022.&nbsp;  1&nbsp; —&nbsp; Cloud connectivity and cloud-to-cloud connectivity will amplify supply-chain breaches  One area organizations need to continue to monitor in 2022 is the software supply chain. We tend to think of cloud apps as disparate islands used as destinations by endpoints and end-users to collect and process data. The reality is that these apps constantly communicate with different entities and systems like software-update infrastructure and with each other — interactions that are often not monitored.  In late 2020, the cybersecurity community uncovered one of the worst breaches in recent memory when the&nbsp; SolarWinds &nbsp;software-publishing infrastructure was infiltrated. More than 100 organizations, including nine U.S. federal agencies, were compromised by trojanized updates that opened backdoors to their infrastructure. This is a prime example of how a weak supply chain can b

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In May 2017, the first documented ransomware assault on networked medical equipment happened. The worldwide ransomware assault WannaCry compromised radiological and other instruments in several hospitals during its height, after a software failure caused by a cyberattack on its third-party vendor's oncology cloud service, cancer patients having radiation therapy at four healthcare institutions had to reschedule appointments.  These examples show how cyberattacks and data breaches may have a significant impact on the healthcare industry, heavily reliant on connected medical equipment. PHI (patient health information) captured and stored in these connected medical devices must be secured. Because PHI is transferred over the cloud via server-based systems, making it very susceptible to hackers.  Ransomware attacks on health care professionals have become more common, sophisticated, and severe in recent years. Individual bad actors have been supplanted as the main perpetrators by orga

Here are the top 3 SaaS security posture challenges as we see them.&nbsp;  1&nbsp; —&nbsp; The Mess of Misconfiguration Management  The good news is that more businesses than ever are using SaaS apps such as GitHub, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Slack, SuccessFactors, Zoom, and many others, to enable employees to maintain productivity under the most challenging of circumstances. As for the bad news, many companies are having a hard time adequately addressing the ever-changing security risks of each app.&nbsp;  This challenge begins with a simple miscalculation—businesses are tasking security teams to ensure that the security configurations for each app are set correctly.&nbsp;  While that may seem like the logical choice, these apps are like snowflakes, no two are the same, including their specific settings and configurations.

One of the harsh realities of cybersecurity today is that malicious actors and attackers don't distinguish between organizations that have seemingly endless resources and those operating with lean IT security teams. For these lean teams, meeting the challenges in the current security landscape requires constant attention, and sometimes a little support.  XDR provider Cynet has built a new minisite ( find it here ) with the goal of giving these lean IT Security teams a space to find answers, share their wins and strategies, gain new insights, and have some fun in the process. The company refers to these lean teams and the people that make them up as Lean IT Security Heroes.  These groups often work with fewer resources, but are always able to defend against massive threats through creativity, ingenuity, and hard work. This new Lean IT Security Heroes minisite offers a variety of activities and tools that are ideal for lean teams looking to enhance their defenses.  Additionally, the sit

The smart are always quick to adapt to new, innovative technologies, and this mindset is exactly what makes normal companies great.  The landscape is changing fast, especially in IT . Change isn't just necessary, but more often than not, it's the single-most-important variable that determines a company's chances of survival.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is that NOT using Feature Flags leads to a more cumbersome, expensive, and slower type of rollout.  Simply put, it makes your project less competitive with those that have their deployments better organized, and that's&nbsp; an edge that you can't afford to lose .   Feature Flags are changing how things work  Many companies are using Feature Flags these days, and for good measure. &nbsp;It's safer and allows for more granular control over what you're building.

Winter is Coming for CentOS 8—but here is how you can enjoy your holidays after all.  The server environment is complex and if you're managing thousands of Linux servers, the last thing you want is for an operating system vendor to do something completely unexpected.  That is exactly what Red Hat, the parent company of the CentOS Project, did when it suddenly announced a&nbsp; curtailment of support for CentOS 8 &nbsp;– sending thousands of organizations scrambling for an alternative.  In this article, we'll review what happened with CentOS 8 and what it means for users who have already upgraded from CentOS release 7 to release 8. We'll also look at your alternatives for replacing CentOS 8.  Finally, we'll do a review of your other option: choosing extended support. Extended lifecycle support (ELS) can reduce the pressure to decide on alternative distribution and it may well be the most practical route for many CentOS 8 users.  Official support is critical  The difficulties arou

Code injection attacks, the infamous king of vulnerabilities, have lost the top spot to broken access control as the worst of the worst, and developers need to take notice.  In this increasingly chaotic world, there have always been a few constants that people could reliably count on: The sun will rise in the morning and set again at night, Mario will always be cooler than Sonic the Hedgehog, and code injection attacks will always occupy the top spot on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) list of the&nbsp; top ten most common &nbsp;and dangerous vulnerabilities that attackers are actively exploiting.  Well, the sun will rise tomorrow, and Mario still has "one-up" on Sonic, but code injection attacks have fallen out of the number one spot on the infamous OWASP list, refreshed in 2021. One of the oldest forms of attacks,&nbsp; code injection vulnerabilities &nbsp;have been around almost as long as computer networking. The blanket vulnerability is responsible for a wide range of attacks, inclu

Representatives from the U.S., the European Union, and 30 other countries pledged to mitigate the risk of ransomware and harden the financial system from exploitation with the goal of disrupting the ecosystem, calling it an "escalating global security threat with serious economic and security consequences."&nbsp;  "From malign operations against local health providers that endanger patient care, to those directed at businesses that limit their ability to provide fuel, groceries, or other goods to the public, ransomware poses a significant risk to critical infrastructure, essential services, public safety, consumer protection and privacy, and economic prosperity," officials&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement released last week.   To that end, efforts are expected to be made to enhance network resilience by adopting cyber hygiene good practices, such as using strong passwords, securing accounts with multi-factor authentication, maintaining periodic offline data backups, keeping softwa

All third-party iOS, iPadOS, and macOS apps that allow users to create an account should also provide a method for terminating their accounts from within the apps beginning next year, Apple said on Wednesday.  "This requirement applies to all app submissions starting January 31, 2022," the iPhone maker&nbsp; said , urging developers to "review any laws that may require you to maintain certain types of data, and to make sure your app clearly explains what data your app collects, how it collects that data, all uses of that data, your data retention/deletion policies."   While the feature could be convenient, it's worth noting that Apple only says the mechanism should have a provision for users to "initiate deletion of their account from within the app," meaning it's possible that apps could redirect users to a website or prompt them to send an email in order actually to purge their information.

Professional developers want to embrace DevSecOps and write secure code, but their organizations need to support this seachange if they want that effort to grow.  The cyber threat landscape is becoming more complex by the day. Attackers are constantly scanning networks for vulnerable applications, programs, cloud instances, and the latest flavor of the month is APIs, widely considered an easy win thanks to their often lax security controls.  They are so persistent that new apps can sometimes be compromised and exploited within hours of deployment. The Verizon 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report makes it very clear that the threats leveled against businesses and organizations&nbsp; are more dangerous &nbsp;today than at any other point in history.  It's becoming very clear that the only way to truly fortify the software being created is to ensure that it's built on secure code. In other words, the best way to stop the threat actor invasion is to deny them a foothold into your applications in

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Sysadmins know what the risks are of running unpatched services. Given the choice, and unlimited resources, most hardworking administrators will ensure that all systems and services are patched consistently.  But things are rarely that simple. Technical resources are limited, and patching can often be more complicated than it appears at first glance. Worse, some services are so hidden in the background, that they just don't make it onto the list of things to be patched.  QEMU is one of those services that tend to create difficulties with patching. It works away in the background and is easy to take for granted. Plus, patching QEMU involves significant technical and practical challenges – while requiring enormous resources.  In this article, we'll address some of the difficulties around patching QEMU, and point to a solution that takes the toughest bits out of QEMU patching.  Ignoring QEMU patching is a big risk  You'll probably know about it if you're using QEMU – shor

In the classic children's movie 'The Princess Bride,' one of the characters utters the phrase, " You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means ."  It's freely used as a response to someone's misuse or misunderstanding of a word or phrase.   "Response Automation" is another one of those phrases that have different meanings to different people. It's bantered around by the security vendor community so much that its precise meaning, when used, is unclear.  Many vendors throw the term out without explaining exactly what they mean by the phrase. One vendor's response automation might, and often do, perform very differently from another vendor's response automation capabilities. But, hey, they have "response automation!"  A recently published guide is meant to make sense of Response Automation ( Download here ). It discusses the evolution of response automation and distinguishes five increasingly capabl

Zero Trust Requires Cloud Data Security with Integrated Continuous Endpoint Risk Assessment<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/zero-trust-requires-cloud-data-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Every once in a while, an industry term will get overused by marketing to the point of becoming a cliche. "Zero Trust" may have reached this threshold.  In some ways, we understand why this is happening. Security perimeters have become obsolete as people use mobile devices and cloud applications to work from anywhere. Zero Trust deployment — moving all your apps and data to the cloud and assuming no user or device is trustworthy until proven otherwise in order to gain access — has been rapidly introduced as a result of the pandemic.  However, most attempts at achieving Zero Trust access today are a patchwork of disparate products from different vendors connected to virtual private networks (VPN), with rudimentary on-off access controls based on limited visibility.  Cloud security company,&nbsp; Lookout , believes a modern approach to Zero Trust needs to take into account the fact that data has moved to the cloud and users are working from anywhere, on any device, and connecting o

Fighting the Rogue Toaster Army: Why Secure Coding in Embedded Systems is Our Defensive Edge<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/fighting-rogue-toaster-army-why-secure.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
There are plenty of pop culture references to rogue AI and robots, and appliances turning on their human masters. It is the stuff of science fiction, fun, and fantasy, but with IoT and connected devices becoming more prevalent in our homes, we need more discussion around cybersecurity and safety.  Software is all around us, and it's very easy to forget just how much we're relying on lines of code to do all those clever things that provide us so much innovation and convenience.  Much like web-based software, APIs, and mobile devices, vulnerable code in embedded systems can be exploited if it is uncovered by an attacker.&nbsp;  While it's unlikely that an army of toasters is coming to enslave the human race (although, the&nbsp; Tesla bot &nbsp;is a bit concerning) as the result of a cyberattack, malicious cyber events are still possible. Some of our cars, planes, and medical devices also rely on intricate embedded systems code to perform key tasks, and the prospect of these objects being compromised i

[Ebook] The Guide for Speeding Time to Response for Lean IT Security Teams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/ebook-guide-for-speeding-time-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Most cyber security today involves much more planning, and much less reacting than in the past. Security teams spend most of their time preparing their organizations' defenses and doing operational work. Even so, teams often must quickly spring into action to respond to an attack.  Security teams with copious resources can quickly shift between these two modes. They have enough resources to allocate to respond properly. Lean IT security teams, however, are more hard-pressed to react effectively. A new guide by XDR provider Cynet ( download here ), however, argues that lean teams can still respond effectively. It just takes some work.&nbsp;  For teams that are resource-constrained, success starts with having a clear plan and putting the tools and infrastructure in place for the organization to follow properly. The guide breaks down the tools, factors, and knowledge that go into optimizing an organization's time to respond.&nbsp;  Building a successful incident response plan  Today's

Is Traffic Mirroring for NDR Worth the Trouble? We Argue It Isn't<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/is-traffic-mirroring-for-ndr-worth.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) is an emerging technology developed to close the blind security spots left by conventional security solutions, which hackers exploited to gain a foothold in target networks.  Nowadays, enterprises are using a plethora of security solutions to protect their network from cyber threats. The most prominent ones are Firewalls, IPS/IDS, SIEM, EDR, and XDR (which combines the functionality of EDR and SIEM). However, all these solutions suffer from security gaps that prevent them from stopping advanced cyber-attacks efficiently.&nbsp;  NDR was developed based on Intrusion Detection System (IDS). An IDS solution is installed on the network perimeter and monitors the network traffic for suspicious activities.  IDS systems suffer from many downsides that make them inefficient in stopping modern cyber-attacks: IDS use signature-based detection techniques to discover abnormal activities, making them unable to spot unknown attacks.  In addition, IDS systems trigger

[LIVE WEBINAR] How Lean Security Teams Can Improve Their Time to Response<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/live-webinar-how-lean-security-teams.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity could be described as a marathon for security teams that spend most of their time building sustained defenses that prevent threats day after day. However, they must be ready to hit a sprint whenever an attack succeeds since attack duration, and the resulting damages are directly correlated.&nbsp;  Reacting to a successful attack is a major challenge for lean security teams today since speed tends to be a result of size. Large teams with abundant resources can respond to incidents much faster as they can expend those resources freely. Lean security teams face the same costs and resource needs but with a much smaller pool to call from. A new live webinar by XDR provider Cynet shows why that doesn't have to be the case ( register here ).&nbsp;  The webinar breaks down how even large enterprises struggle with time to response. Look at any of the major breaches of the past years and you'll find large security teams that overlooked red flags or mishandled their incident response. It's n

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Attackers are using many types of attacks to compromise business-critical data. These can include zero-day attacks, supply chain attacks, and others. However, one of the most common ways that hackers get into your environment is by compromising passwords.  The password spraying attack is a special kind of password attack that can prove effective in compromising your environment. Let's look closer at the password spraying attack and how organizations can prevent it.  Beware of compromised credentials  Are compromised credentials dangerous to your environment? Yes! Compromised credentials allow an attacker to "walk in the front door" of your environment with legitimate credentials. They assume all the rights and permissions to systems, data, and resources the compromised account can access.  The compromise of a privileged account is even worse. Privileged accounts are accounts that have high levels of access, such as an administrator user account. These types of accounts r

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As cyber threats keep on increasing in volume and sophistication, more and more organizations acknowledge that outsourcing their security operations to a 3rd-party service provider is a practice that makes the most sense.  To address this demand, managed security services providers (MSSPs) and managed service providers (MSPs) continuously search for the right products that would empower their teams to deliver high-quality and scalable services.  Cynet 360 Autonomous Breach Protection platform offers a multitenant security solution for MSSP/MSP, providing automated, all-in-one products that include a robust SOAR layer, on top of attack prevention and detection. (Learn more about&nbsp; Cynet's partner program for MSPs and MSSPs &nbsp;here).  Service providers typically have a skilled security team at their disposal. The challenge is how to leverage this skill to serve as many customers as possible without compromising on the quality of the service. That makes each minute of each team member a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Among the problems stemming from our systemic failure with cybersecurity, which ranges from decades-old software-development practices to Chinese and Russian cyber-attacks, one problem gets far less attention than it should—the insider threat.  But the reality is that most organizations should be at least as worried about user management as they are about Bond villain-type hackers launching compromises from abroad.  Most organizations have deployed single sign-on and modern identity-management solutions. These generally allow easy on-boarding, user management, and off-boarding.  However, on mobile devices, these solutions have been less effective. Examples include mobile applications such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, or even SMS-which are common in the workforce.  All of these tools allow for low-friction, agile communication in an increasingly mobile business environment. Today, many of these tools offer end-to-end encryption (e2ee), which is a boon when viewed through the lens of

Best Practices to Thwart Business Email Compromise (BEC) Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/best-practices-to-thwart-business-email_29.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Business email compromise (BEC) refers to all types of email attacks that do not have payloads. Although there are numerous types, there are essentially two main mechanisms through which attackers penetrate organizations utilizing BEC techniques, spoofing and account take-over attacks.  In a recent&nbsp; study , 71% of organizations acknowledged they had seen a business email compromise (BEC) attack during the past year. Forty-three percent of organizations experienced a security incident in the last 12 months, with 35% stating that BEC/phishing attacks account for more than 50% of the incidents.  The&nbsp; FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center &nbsp;(IC3) reports that BEC scams were the most expensive of cyberattacks in 2020, with 19,369 complaints and adjusted losses of approximately $1.8 billion. Recent BEC attacks include spoofing attacks on Shark Tank Host Barbara Corcoran, who lost&nbsp; $380,000 ; the Puerto Rican government attacks that amounted to $4 million, and Japanese media giant, Nikkei

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
There is a saying that goes something like, "Do not judge a book by its cover." Yet, we all know we can not help but do just that - especially when it comes to online security.  Logos play a significant role in whether or not we open an email and how we assess the importance of each message. Brand Indicators for Message Identification, or BIMI, aims to make it easier for us to quickly identify important information within emails using branding guidelines and visual cues found in logos.&nbsp;  In recent years, users are often unsure about the authenticity of emails, and this has become a major issue for businesses fighting spam. BIMI  gives email users access to information about a brand's identity. A company has complete control and freedom over what logo to attach to authenticated emails. Overall, BIMI acts as an additional layer of security to the existing email authentication process.  What is BIMI, and how does it strengthen the security of your emails?&nbsp;  BIMI is a standa

Nearly three weeks after Florida-based software vendor Kaseya was hit by a&nbsp; widespread supply-chain ransomware attack , the company on Thursday said it obtained a universal decryptor to unlock systems and help customers recover their data.   "On July 21, Kaseya obtained a decryptor for victims of the REvil ransomware attack, and we're working to remediate customers impacted by the incident," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. "Kaseya obtained the tool from a third-party and have teams actively helping customers affected by the ransomware to restore their environments, with no reports of any problem or issues associated with the decryptor."  It's not immediately unclear if Kaseya paid any ransom. It's worth noting that REvil affiliates had&nbsp; demanded a ransom of $70 million &nbsp;— an amount that was subsequently lowered to $50 million — but soon after, the ransomware gang mysteriously&nbsp; went off the grid , shutting down their payment sites and data leak portal

[eBook] A Guide to Stress-Free Cybersecurity for Lean IT Security Teams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/ebook-guide-to-stress-free.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Today's cybersecurity landscape is enough to make any security team concerned. The rapid evolution and increased danger of attack tactics have put even the largest corporations and governments at heightened risk. If the most elite security teams can't prevent these attacks from happening, what can lean security teams look forward to?&nbsp;  Surprisingly, leaner teams have a much greater chance than they think. It might seem counterintuitive, but recent history has shown that large numbers and huge budgets aren't the difference-makers they once were. Indeed, having the right strategy in place is a clear indicator of an organization's success today.  A new guide by XDR provider Cynet ( download it here ) looks to dispel the myth that bigger is always better and shows a smarter way forward for lean IT security teams.  The new guide focuses on helping lean IT security teams plan strategies that can protect their organizations while reducing the level of stress they face. Due to the rise of cyb

According to Keeper Security's Workplace Password Malpractice Report, many remote workers aren't following best practices for password security.  Password security was a problem even before the advent of widespread remote work. So, what happened post-pandemic?&nbsp; Keeper Security's Workplace Password Malpractice Report &nbsp;sought to find out.  In February 2021, Keeper surveyed 1,000 employees in the U.S. about their work-related password habits -- and discovered that a lot of remote workers are letting password security go by the wayside.  Here are 5 critical password security rules they're ignoring.  1 — Always use strong passwords  Strong passwords are at least eight characters long (preferably more) and consist of random strings of letters, numerals, and special characters. Passwords should never include dictionary words, which are easy to guess, or personal details, which cybercriminals can scrape off social media channels.   37% of respondents to Keeper's survey sai

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Instagram earlier this week introduced a new " Security Checkup " feature that aims to keep accounts safe and help users—whose accounts may have been compromised—to recover them.  In order to gain access to accounts, users will be prompted to perform a series of steps, which include checking recent login activity, reviewing profile information, and updating contact details such as phone numbers or email.   Additionally, the Facebook-owned company is also "strongly" recommending users to turn on two-factor authentication for extra security and preventing unauthorized logins.   On that front, Instagram also said it would allow users in selected countries to use their WhatsApp numbers to authenticate their accounts.    Stressing that "Instagram will never send you a [direct message]," the social media platform cautioned users to be on the lookout for scams, wherein malicious accounts reach out via DMs to try and access sensitive information like account pass

Use This Definitive RFP Template to Effectively Evaluate XDR solutions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/07/extended-detection-response.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new class of security tools is emerging that promises to significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of threat detection and response.   Emerging Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solutions aim to aggregate and correlate telemetry from multiple detection controls and then synthesize response actions.   XDR has been referred to as the next step in the evolution of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.   In fact, Gartner named XDR as the first of their Top 9 Security and Risk Trend  for 2020.   Because XDR represents a new solution category, there is no single accepted definition of what capabilities and features should (and shouldn't) be included.   Each provider approaches XDR with different strengths and perspectives on how what an XDR solution should include.   Therefore, selecting an XDR provider is quite challenging as organizations must organize and prioritize a wide range of capabilities that can differ significantly between providers.   Cynet is now

On July 9, President Biden warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that the United States will take “any necessary action,” including imposing unspecified “consequences,” if Russia does not disrupt ransomware attacks from its soil. The problem with this warning is that the United States has been publicly pledging to impose “consequences” on Russia for its cyber actions for at least five years.

Modern password policies are comprised of many different elements that contribute to its effectiveness. One of the components of an effective current password policy makes use of what is known as a&nbsp; custom dictionary&nbsp; that filters out certain words that are not allowed as passwords in the environment.  Using custom dictionaries, organizations can significantly improve their cybersecurity posture and filter out obvious passwords that provide poor security for user accounts.  When using password dictionaries in your password policy, there are many different approaches to consider. First, let's consider crafting a custom dictionary for your password policy, including general guidance on how these are created, configured, and how you can easily use custom dictionaries in an active directory environment.  Why customize your dictionary?&nbsp;  Custom dictionaries are born from the need to "think as a hacker thinks." Compromised credentials are one of the leading causes of malicious

For years, security professionals have recognized the need to enhance SaaS security. However, the exponential adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications over 2020 turned slow-burning embers into a raging fire.&nbsp;  Organizations manage anywhere from thirty-five to more than a hundred applications. From collaboration tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams to mission-critical applications like SAP and Salesforce, SaaS applications act as the foundation of the modern enterprise. 2020 created an urgent need for security solutions that mitigate SaaS misconfiguration risks.  Recognizing the importance of SaaS security, Gartner named a new category, SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM), to distinguish solutions that have the capabilities to offer a continuous assessment of security risks arising from a SaaS application's deployment.&nbsp;  To understand how security teams are currently dealing with their SaaS security posture and what their main concerns are, Adaptive Shield, a leading S

[Whitepaper] XDR vs. NDR/NTA – What do Organizations Truly Need to Stay Safe?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/whitepaper-xdr-vs-ndrnta-what-do.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security teams whose organizations are outside the Fortune 500 are faced with a dilemma. Most teams will have to choose between deploying either a network traffic analysis (NTA) or network detection and response (NDR) tool or an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool to supplement their existing stacks.  On the other hand, some organizations are getting the best of both options by switching to extended detection and response (XDR) tools which often provide all these tools in one solution.  This is the key takeaway of a new whitepaper by security provider Cynet ( download it here ).  NDR tools have become more popular, and for a good reason. They offer organizations a variety of benefits and can help further secure an environment from lateral movement attacks and further infiltration if an initial attack succeeds. NDR tools can detect a wide range of malicious activities and anomalous behaviors.&nbsp;  The question is whether the strengths of an NDR tool outweigh its limitations.&nbsp;  The

Securing applications it the API-first era can be an uphill battle. As development accelerates, accountability becomes unclear, and getting controls to operate becomes a challenge in itself. It's time that we rethink our application security strategies to reflect new priorities, principles and processes in the API-first era. Securing tomorrow's applications begins with assessing the business risks today.  The trends and risks shaping today's applications  As the world continues to become more and more interconnected via devices — and the APIs that connect them — individuals are growing accustomed to the frictionless experience that they provide. While this frictionless reality is doubtlessly more user-friendly, i.e., faster and more convenient, it also requires a trade-off. This convenience demands openness, and openness is a risk when it comes to cybersecurity.

The recent tsunami of ransomware has brought to life the fears of downtime and data loss cybersecurity pros have warned about, as attacks on the energy sector, food supply chain, healthcare industry, and other critical infrastructure have grabbed headlines.  For the industry experts who track the evolution of this threat, the increased frequency, sophistication, and destructiveness of ransomware suggests that businesses still have some major gaps in their defense strategies.  It's no surprise that a new, multi-layered approach to protection is needed to stem the damage caused by ransomware. But what changes should an IT team implement to close those gaps?  During a recent panel, a team of cybersecurity experts outlined a three-step plan to do just that -- centered around embracing new technologies, improving security processes, and ensuring their people know how to help curb the threat.  1&nbsp; —&nbsp; New Strains Overwhelm Old Defenses  Many new ransomware strains now act like advanced pe

Washington’s crackdown on the market power of Big Tech hit a roadblock Monday, after a D.C. federal court dismissed two antitrust cases brought against Facebook. The update comes after the House Judiciary Committee last week advanced six bills aimed at giving regulators more authority to rein in the power of the tech companies, and supporters of the bills are using the dismissal to boost the bills as they head to a full floor vote (see top Republican on the House antitrust subcommittee Colorado Rep.

There has been a lot of buzz in the industry about ransomware lately. Almost every other day, it's making headlines. With businesses across the globe holding their breath, scared they might fall victim to the next major ransomware attack, it is now time to take action.

Enterprise applications used to live securely in data centers and office employees connected to internal networks using company-managed laptops or desktops. And data was encircled by a walled perimeter to keep everything safe.  All that changed in the last 18 months. Businesses and employees had to adapt quickly to cloud technology and remote work. The cloud gave businesses the agility to respond faster to change and the scale to accommodate rapid growth. Remote work boosted productivity by letting employees access cloud data from anywhere on any device.  This is not business as usual. The data center and the perimeter security are no longer the center of the universe. Now remote workers, personal mobile devices, applications, and data are in the middle.  Although employees, applications, and data have left the building, IT security teams still shoulder the responsibility for protecting confidential data and ensuring compliance with strict privacy regulations.

Controversial mogul and antivirus pioneer John McAfee on Wednesday died by suicide in a jail cell in Barcelona, hours after reports that he would be extradited to face federal charges in the U.S.  McAfee was 75. He is said to have died by hanging "as his nine months in prison brought him to despair," according to McAfee's lawyer Javier Villalba, Reuters&nbsp; reported . Security personnel at the Brians 2 prison tried to revive McAfee, but he was eventually declared dead, per&nbsp; Associated Press .   News of his death comes after Spain's National Court approved his extradition to the U.S. to face federal criminal tax evasion charges.  McAfee worked for NASA, Xerox, and Lockheed Martin before launching the world's first commercial antivirus software in 1987. He later resigned from the namesake security firm in 1994.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
It seems like every new day brings with it a new ransomware news item – new attacks, methods, horror stories, and data being leaked.  Ransomware attacks are on the rise, and they've become a major issue for organizations across industries. A recent report estimated that by 2031, ransomware attacks would cost the world over $260 billion.  A new whitepaper from XDR provider Cynet demonstrates how the company's platform can help organizations mitigate the impact of ransomware ( download here ).  Today, attackers have shown themselves to be less interested in ignoring the most vulnerable sectors, such as health care providers and hospitals. With a parallel increase in the number of variants – Wastedlocker, FTCode, Tycooon, TrickBot, REvil, and many others – it's becoming harder to defend against the growing threat of ransomware.  Ransomware operates by using a variety of infection and encryption techniques to steal or barricade companies' files behind hard paywalls. Even t

A wireless network naming bug has been discovered in Apple's iOS operating system that effectively disables an iPhone's ability to connect to a Wi-Fi network.  The issue was spotted by security researcher&nbsp; Carl Schou , who found that the phone's Wi-Fi functionality gets permanently disabled after joining a Wi-Fi network with the unusual name " %p%s%s%s%s%n " even after rebooting the phone or changing the network's name (i.e., service set identifier or SSID).   The bug could have serious implications in that bad actors could exploit the issue to plant fraudulent Wi-Fi hotspots with the name in question to break the device's wireless networking features.  After joining my personal WiFi with the SSID "%p%s%s%s%s%n", my iPhone permanently disabled it's WiFi functionality. Neither rebooting nor changing SSID fixes it :~) pic.twitter.com/2eue90JFu3 — Carl Schou (@vm_call) June 18, 2021   The issue stems from a&nbsp; string formatting &nbsp;bug in the manner iOS parses th

[eBook] 7 Signs You Might Need a New Detection and Response Tool<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/ebook-7-signs-you-might-need-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
It's natural to get complacent with the status quo when things seem to be working. The familiar is comfortable, and even if something better comes along, it brings with it many unknowns.  In cybersecurity, this tendency is countered by the fast pace of innovation and how quickly technology becomes obsolete, often overnight.  This combination usually results in one of two things – organizations make less than ideal choices about the software and tools they're adding, or security leaders simply cannot stay abreast of new developments and opt to stay put with their existing stack.  The problem is that once you let one update pass you by, you're suddenly miles behind. A new eBook from XDR provider Cynet ( download here ) offers insights into factors that are clear signs organizations need to upgrade their detection and response tools to stay with the times.

Live Cybersecurity Webinar — Deconstructing Cobalt Strike<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/live-cybersecurity-webinar.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Organizations' cybersecurity capabilities have improved over the past decade, mostly out of necessity. As their defenses get better, so do the methods, tactics, and techniques malicious actors devise to penetrate their environments.  Instead of the standard virus or trojan, attackers today will deploy a variety of tools and methods to infiltrate an organization's environment and attack it from the inside.  In an interesting twist of fate, one of the tools organizations have used to audit and improve their defenses has also become a popular tool attackers use to infiltrate. Cobalt Strike is an Adversary Simulation and Red Team Operations tool that allows organizations to simulate advanced attacks and test their security stacks in a close-to-real-world simulation.  A new research webinar from XDR provider Cynet ( register here ) offers a better look at Cobalt Strike. The webinar, led by Cyber Operations Analyst for the Cynet MDR Team Yuval Fischer, will take a deep dive into the thr

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Bolstering password policies in your organization is an important part of a robust cybersecurity strategy. Cybercriminals are using compromised accounts as one of their favorite tactics to infiltrate business-critical environments; as we've seen in recent news, these attacks can be dangerous and financially impactful.  Unfortunately, account compromise is a very successful attack method and requires much less effort than other attack vectors.  One of the essential types of password protection recommended by noted cybersecurity standards is&nbsp; breached password detection . Hackers often use known breached password lists in credential stuffing or password spraying attacks.  Here are some critical criteria to consider when your sysadmins are evaluating breached password protection solutions.&nbsp;  Breached password recommendations  In the last few years, password security recommendations have evolved past the traditional recommendations regarding password security.&nbsp;  Businesses have used M

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The speed at which malicious actors have improved their attack tactics and continue to penetrate security systems has made going bigger the major trend in cybersecurity.  Facing an evolving threat landscape, organizations have responded by building bigger security stacks, adding more tools and platforms, and making their defenses more complex—a new eBook from XDR provider Cynet ( read it here ).  Organizations find themselves in a virtual arms race with malicious actors. Attackers find new, stealthier ways to penetrate an organization's defenses, and organizations build higher walls, buy more technologies to protect themselves, and expand their security stacks.  Money is a key component of security success – a tough reality for leaner organizations that might not have the seemingly endless budgets of larger corporations and enterprises.  The question of what leaner security teams could do about it used to be "not a lot," but today, that's hardly the case. Even though

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing cyber-espionage operation with suspected ties to China has been found targeting a Southeast Asian government to deploy spyware on Windows systems while staying under the radar for more than three years.  "In this campaign, the attackers utilized the set of Microsoft Office exploits and loaders with anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques to install a previously unknown backdoor on victim's machines," researchers from Check Point  Research said in a report published today.  The infection chain works by sending decoy documents, impersonating other entities within the government, to multiple members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which, when opened, retrieves a next-stage payload from the attacker's server that contains an encrypted downloader. The downloader, in turn, gathers and exfiltrates system information to a remote server that subsequently responds back with a shellcode loader.

The unfortunate truth is that while companies are investing more in cyber defenses and taking cybersecurity more seriously than ever, successful breaches and ransomware attacks are on the rise. While a successful breach is not inevitable, it is becoming more likely despite best efforts to prevent it from happening.&nbsp;  Just as it wasn't raining when Noah built the ark, companies must face the fact that they need to prepare - and educate the organization on - a well-thought-out response plan if a successful cyberattack does occur. Obviously, the worst time to plan your response to a cyberattack is when it happens.  With so many companies falling victim to cyberattacks, an entire cottage industry of Incident Response (IR) services has arisen. Thousands of IR engagements have helped surface best practices and preparedness guides to help those that have yet to fall victim to a cyberattack.&nbsp;  Recently, cybersecurity company Cynet provided an&nbsp; Incident Response plan Word template &nbsp;to help com

Are you aware of how secure your domain is? In most organizations, there is an assumption that their domains are secure and within a few months, but the truth soon dawns on them that it isn't.  Spotting someone spoofing your domain name is one way to determine if your security is unsatisfactory - this means that someone is impersonating you (or confusing some of your recipients) and releasing false information. You may ask, "But why should I care?" Because these spoofing activities can potentially endanger your reputation.  With so many companies being targeted by domain impersonators, email domain spoofing shouldn't be taken lightly. By doing so, they could put themselves, as well as their clients, at risk.&nbsp;  Your domain's security rating can make a huge difference in whether or not you get targeted by phishers looking to make money quickly or to use your domain and brand to spread ransomware without you knowing it!

Russian-language dark web marketplace Hydra has emerged as a hotspot for illicit activities, pulling in a whopping $1.37 billion worth of cryptocurrencies in 2020, up from $9.4 million in 2016.  The "blistering growth" in annual transaction volumes marks a staggering 624% year-over-year jump over a three-year period from 2018 to 2020.  "Further buoying Hydra's growth is its ability—or its good fortune—to remain running and unscathed against competitor attacks or&nbsp; law enforcement scrutiny ; its only downtime of note occurred during a short time period at the beginning of the COVID-19 global pandemic in late March 2020," threat intelligence firm Flashpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report jointly published with blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.

There is a person in every organization that is the direct owner of breach protection. His or her task is to oversee and govern the process of design, build, maintain, and continuously enhance the security level of the organization.   Title-wise, this person is most often either the CIO, CISO, or Directory of IT. For convenience, we'll refer to this individual as the CISO.   This person is the subject-matter expert in understanding the standard set of active cyber risks, benchmarking to what degree the organization's exposure influences potential impact. They then take appropriate steps to ensure the major risks are addressed.   On top of being engaged 24/7 in the organization's actual breach protection activity, the CISO has another critical task: to articulate the risks, potential impacts and appropriate steps to take to the company's management – or in other words, they must effectively translate security issues for non-security-savvy executives in a clear and busi

If there's one thing all great SaaS platforms share in common, it's their focus on simplifying the lives of their end-users. Removing friction for users in a safe way is the mission of single sign-on (SSO) providers.  With SSO at the helm, users don't have to remember separate passwords for each app or hide the digital copies of the credentials in plain sight.  SSO also frees up the IT's bandwidth from handling recurring password reset requests while improving productivity for everyone in your organization. However, there is also a level of risk that comes with SSO capability.&nbsp;  How to protect against SSO fails  Real-Life Risks Involved in SSO&nbsp;  While SSO facilitates ease of access to a great extent, it also comes with some amount of imminent risk.

Free "vCISO Clinic" offers Resource-Constrained InfoSec Leaders a Helping Hand<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/free-vciso-clinic-offers-resource.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Leaders in the InfoSec field face a strange dilemma. On the one hand, there are hundreds of thousands of resources available to find online to read (or watch) if they have questions – that's a benefit of a digital-first field. On the other hand, most leaders face challenges that – while not entirely unique each time – tend to require a specific touch or solution.  For most, it would be great to have a sympathetic ear or a fresh perspective that has faced similar challenges. Where does the tip of the spear turn to for a helping hand?  One popular avenue is to turn to a virtual CISO (or vCISO), an external consultant who can offer strategic advice, suggestions and help find insights that can be instrumental in building better security systems.  For many organizations, having the benefits of a CISO, even on a temporary basis, can be incredibly helpful and valuable.  With that in mind, Chris Roberts, Cynet's chief security strategist, is offering a new program ( you can learn more

Experts Reveal Over 150 Ways to Steal Control of 58 Android Stalkerware Apps<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/experts-reveal-over-150-ways-to-steal.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A total of 158 privacy and security issues have been identified in 58 Android stalkware apps from various vendors that could enable a malicious actor to take control of a victim's device, hijack a stalker's account, intercept data, achieve remote code execution, and even frame the victim by uploading fabricated evidence.  The new findings, which come from an analysis of 86 stalkerware apps for the Android platform undertaken by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, highlight the unintended consequences of a practice that's not only unethical but in the process could also expose private and intimate information of the victims and leave them at risk of cyberattacks and fraud.  "Since there could be a close relationship between stalker and victim, the stalker's private information could also be exposed," ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday write-up. "During our research, we identified that some stalkerware keeps information about the stalkers using

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In today's digital world, password security is more important than ever. While biometrics, one-time passwords (OTP), and other emerging forms of authentication are often touted as replacements to the traditional password, today, this concept is more marketing hype than anything else.  But just because&nbsp; passwords aren't going anywhere anytime soon &nbsp;doesn't mean that organizations don't need to modernize their approach to password hygiene right now.&nbsp;  The Compromised Credential Crisis  As Microsoft's&nbsp; security team put it , "All it takes is one compromised credential…to cause a data breach." Coupled with the rampant problem of password reuse, compromised passwords can have a significant and long-lasting impact on enterprise security.  In fact, researchers from Virginia Tech University found that over 70% of users employed a compromised password for other accounts up to a year after it was initially leaked, with 40% reusing passwords that were leaked over three years ago.

Report to Your Management with the Definitive 'Incident Response for Management' Presentation Template<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2019/10/cybersecurity-incident-response.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security incidents occur. It's not a matter of 'if' but of 'when.' There are security products and procedures that were implemented to optimize the IR process, so from the 'security-professional' angle, things are taken care of.   However, many security pros who are doing an excellent job in handling incidents find effectively communicating the ongoing process with their management a much more challenging task.   It's a little surprise — managements are typically not security savvy and don't really care about the bits and bytes in which the security pro masters. Cynet addresses this gap with the IR Reporting for Management PPT template , providing CISOs and CIOs with a clear and intuitive tool to report both the ongoing IR process and its conclusion.   The IR for Management template enables CISOs and CIOs to communicate with the two key points that management cares about—assurance that the incident is under control and a clear understanding of imp

Big Cybersecurity Tips For Remote Workers Who Use Their Own Tech<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/big-cybersecurity-tips-for-remote.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the total number of people working from home has grown dramatically in the last year or two, so has the number of individuals who use all of their own technology for their jobs. If you're a remote worker who relies on your own PC to get your work done, then you may be at a heightened risk for some of the major threats that are impacting the computer industry as a whole.  Relatively few people take all of the recommended precautions when using their own technology. While it's unlikely that people are engaged in any riskier behaviors than they were before, the fact that few people have the time to follow all the relevant pieces of cybersecurity news means some people might be unaware of certain active threats. That may explain how a password manager was&nbsp; used to install malicious code &nbsp;on a large number of client machines.

Colonial Pipeline, which restarted operations Wednesday, reportedly chose to pay the ransom to gain access to its networks. In non-pipeline news, Amazon said it will soon hire 75,000 additional employees in the U.S. and Canada.&nbsp;

Can Data Protection Systems Prevent Data At Rest Leakage?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/can-data-protection-systems-prevent.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Protection against insider risks works when the process involves controlling the data transfer channels or examining data sources.  One approach involves preventing USB flash drives from being copied or sending them over email. The second one concerns preventing leakage or fraud in which an insider accesses files or databases with harmful intentions.  What's the best way to protect your data?  It seems obvious that prevention is the best way to solve any problem. In most cases, DCAP (data-centric audit and protection) and DAM (database activity monitoring) is sufficient. Both serve the purpose of protecting data at rest.  The following example illustrates the approach we found in the Russian legal system.  An employee of the Federal Migration Service in one of the Russian regions was approached by his friend, who asked him to hide information about two offenses in his file in the migrant database. The employee knew that this could be done remotely, accessed the database from home,

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The concept of automation has taken on a life of its own in recent years. The idea is nothing new, but the current interest in automation is a mix of both hype and innovation.  On the one hand, it's much easier today to automate everything from small processes to massive-scale tasks than it's ever been before. On the other hand, are we really prepared to hand the reins over to completely automated systems, and should we?  There are areas in security operations where automation is already a critical component. In terms of analytics and parsing through ever-expanding data flows, it's impossible for most teams to keep up without impacting other areas of their jobs. Automated systems help us make sense of threats much faster and more reliably. However, automation isn't a cure-all (just yet). A new live webinar from XDR provider Cynet dives into the topic more in depth ( register here ).  The webinar explores automation as it exists today in the cybersecurity industry. Led

The nation’s oil and gas sector was left reeling from a ransomware attack late last week that caused Colonial Pipeline to shut down operations that provide around 45 percent of the East Coast’s oil. Officials and experts said Monday that the hack underscored vulnerabilities in the nation’s critical utilities, while the Biden administration launched a “whole-of-government” response to address the crisis.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For as long as corporate IT has been in existence, users have been required to change their passwords periodically. In fact, the need for scheduled password changes may be one of the most long-standing of all IT best practices.  Recently, however, things have started to change. Microsoft has reversed course on the best practices that it has had in place for decades and&nbsp; no longer recommends that organizations require users to change passwords periodically . Organizations are being forced to consider, perhaps for the first time, whether or not requiring periodic password changes is a good idea.  Microsoft password reset recommendations  According to Microsoft, requiring users to change their passwords frequently does more harm than good.&nbsp;  Humans are notoriously resistant to change. When a user is forced to change their password, they will often come up with a new password that is based on their previous password. A user might, for example, append a number to the end of their password

InfoSec leaders tend to be a specific type. Their jobs require them to think of possible threats, take actions that may not pay immediate results, plan for unknown security risks, and react quickly when emergencies arise, often before the morning's first coffee.  The high-stakes position also means that CISOs need to keep their knowledge and skills sharp – you can never really know what's around the corner.  So, what can security leaders do to make sure they're prepared and hone their skills ahead of the next inevitable threat? Now, they can test themselves and their knowledge at a new website, 'The CISO Challenge' ( visit it here ). The website, launched by XDR provider Cynet, aims to let information security leaders test their cybersecurity mettle.  The website features a challenge for InfoSec leaders (and those who are looking to become one) to test their knowledge in an exciting, high-stakes, realistic series of scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ask the average helpdesk technician what they do all day, and they will probably answer by saying that they reset passwords. Sure, helpdesk technicians do plenty of other things too, but in many organizations, a disproportionate number of helpdesk calls are tied to password resets.  On the surface, having a&nbsp; helpdesk technician reset a user's password &nbsp;probably doesn't seem like a big deal. After all, the technician simply opens Active Directory Users and Computers, right-clicks on the user account, and chooses the Reset Password command from the shortcut menu. Resetting a password in this way is an easy process. Organizations can even opt to use an alternative tool such as the Windows Admin Center or even PowerShell if they prefer.  One thing that most people probably don't stop and think about, however, is that even though the steps involved in the password reset process are simple enough, the&nbsp; process as a whole constitutes a major security risk .

Here's A New Forum for Cybersecurity Leaders Outside of the Fortune 2000<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/heres-new-forum-for-cybersecurity.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Perhaps due to the nature of the position, the InfoSec leadership roles tend to be solitary ones. CISOs, or their equivalent decision-makers in organizations without the role, have so many constant drains on their attention – keeping their knowledge fresh, building plans to secure their organizations further – that they often find themselves on an island.  It's even more challenging for organizations outside the Fortune 2000 that are resource-constrained.  Security leaders are expected to know everything and often don't have anyone inside their organization with whom to bounce ideas or even go to for advice. When a crisis arises, they must often go with their gut or guess at the best solution based on their own experiences.  Security leaders could often use advice but don't have an outlet for it. Chris Roberts, Chief Security Strategist at Cynet Security, offers a new Slack-based community for InfoSec leaders ( register here ) as a solution.  The new InfoSec Leaders Community will fea

Parler said it will be back in the Apple App Store this week with approved changes, but those updates may come with the risk of losing the platform’s base users over accusations of selling out to Big Tech and losing its pro-free speech model. Speaking of free speech, a high schooler’s Snapchat about failing to make the varsity cheerleading team is at the center of a crucial First Amendment Supreme Court case. And pressure is mounting for Google to take action in line with its public statements on race, with a civil rights organization calling on the company to conduct a racial equity audit.&nbsp;

Cybersecurity Webinar: Understanding the 2020 MITRE ATT&amp;CK Results<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/cybersecurity-webinar-understanding.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The release of MITRE Engenuity's Carbanak+Fin7 ATT&amp;CK evaluations every year is a benchmark for the cybersecurity industry.  The organization's tests measure how well security vendors can detect and respond to threats and offers an independent metric for customers and security leaders to understand how well vendors perform on a variety of tasks.  However, for the uninitiated, the results can be hard to decipher and contextualize properly. Unlike many benchmarks that compare participants in a competitive manner, MITRE's framework evaluates companies exclusively on how they respond to the tests.  This means that customers must really know what they're looking for. A new webinar ( register here ) aims to provide some clarity on what to look for and how to interpret the results.&nbsp;  Cynet's new live webinar will dig a little deeper into the MITRE ATT&amp;CK evaluation.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
There are many labor-intensive tasks that the IT service desk carries out on a daily basis. None as tedious and costly as resetting passwords.  Modern IT service desks spend a significant amount of time both unlocking and resetting passwords for end-users. This issue has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Causes of account lockouts and password resets  End-user password policies, such as those found in Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS), typically define a&nbsp; password age . The password age is the length of time an end-user can keep their current password.  While&nbsp; new guidance from NIST &nbsp;recommends against the long-held notion of forced password changes, it is still a common and required security mechanism across other compliance standards and industry certifications such as PCI and HITRUST.  When the password age is reached for the user account, the user must change their account password. It is generally prompted at the next login on their workstation. This sce

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For most organizations today, endpoint protection is the primary security concern. This is not unreasonable – endpoints tend to be the weakest points in an environment – but it also misses the forest for the trees. As threat surfaces expand, security professionals are harder pressed to detect threats that target other parts of an environment and can easily miss a real vulnerability by focusing too hard on endpoints.  This is why pairing tools such as next-generation antivirus (NGAV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) has become a popular, if flawed, choice. Fortunately, newer technologies and security methods offer much greater prevention and detection capabilities. This is the key argument of a new eBook ( download here ) offered by XDR provider Cynet.  The eBook, titled&nbsp; Why Autonomous XDR is Going to Replace NGAV/EDR,&nbsp; starts with a look at how NGAV and EDR tools can defend an organization with the "assume breach" mentality – expecting a breach to occur and protecting endpoi

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The concept of "passwordless" authentication has been gaining significant industry and media attention. And for a good reason. Our digital lives are demanding an ever-increasing number of online accounts and services, with security best practices dictating that each requires a strong, unique password in order to ensure data stays safe. Who wouldn't want an easier way?  That's the premise behind one-time passwords (OTP), biometrics, pin codes, and other authentication methods presented as passwordless security. Rather than remembering cumbersome passwords, users can authenticate themselves using something they own, know, or are. Some examples include a smartphone, OTP, hardware token, or biometric marker like a fingerprint. While this sounds appealing on the surface, the problem is that, when you dig deeper, these passwordless solutions are still reliant on passwords.  This happens in two primary ways:  Passwordless Solutions Rely on Passwords as a Fallback  If you ha

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
One of the biggest consequences of the rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat landscape is that defenses must constantly build bigger systems to defend themselves.&nbsp;  This leads to both more complex systems and often less communication between them. More importantly, it can lead companies to invest in disparate "best in class" components instead of finding the best fit for their needs.  The constant arms race means that companies often get bigger, more powerful tools that can't handle the nuanced threats they face. For instance, in a car race, it's not often the fastest, most powerful car that wins, but the one that is more balanced, lighter, and more able to turn and react when needed.  In a new live webinar, Cynet Chief Strategist Chris Roberts breaks down why the philosophy of "simpler is better" is just what cybersecurity needs ( register here ).  The webinar will focus on how quickly cybersecurity stacks are growing and how this is not always a good thing. Companies are too focused

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The SolarWinds attack , which succeeded by utilizing the sunburst malware , shocked the cyber-security industry. This attack achieved persistence and was able to evade internal systems long enough to gain access to the source code of the victim.  Because of the far-reaching SolarWinds deployments, the perpetrators were also able to infiltrate many other organizations, looking for intellectual property and other assets.  Among the co-victims: US government, government contractors, Information Technology companies, and NGOs. Terabytes of data of 18,000 customers was stolen after a trojan-ized version of the SolarWinds application was installed in the internal structures of the clients.  Looking at the technical capabilities of the malware, as you will see, this particular attack was quite impressive. A particular file, named&nbsp; SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll &nbsp;is a SolarWinds digitally signed component of the Orion software framework.  The threat actors installed a backdoor that c

Behind the strategies and solutions needed to counter today's cyber threats are—dedicated cybersecurity researchers. They spend their lives dissecting code and analyzing incident reports to discover how to stop the bad guys.&nbsp;  But what drives these specialists? To understand the motivations for why these cybersecurity pros do what they do, we decided to talk with cybersecurity analysts from around the world.  To get viewpoints from across Europe, Asia, and the Americas, we recently spoke with a team of researchers from Acronis' global network of Cyber Protection Operations Centers (CPOCs):&nbsp; Candid Wüest , VP of Cyber Protection Research who is based in Switzerland;&nbsp; Alexander Ivanyuk , Senior Director, Product, and Technology Positioning, who is based in Singapore; and two Cybersecurity Analysts,&nbsp; Topher Tebow &nbsp;and&nbsp; Blake Collins , who are both based in the U.S.  The conversation yielded some interesting insights into their views of the world, how they approach cyber threat an

The data is in. According to IBM Security's&nbsp; 2020 Cost of a Data Breach Report , there is a 50% increase in cloud usage for enterprises across all industries. The number of threats targeting cloud services, predominantly collaboration services like Office 365, has&nbsp; increased 630% .

Meanwhile, political ads will once again be allowed on Facebook after an extended pause in the wake of the deadly Capitol riot. And Parler is not giving up.

Let's first take a look back at 2020!  Adding to the list of difficulties that surfaced last year, 2020 was also grim for personal data protection, as it has marked a new record number of leaked credentials and PI data.  A whopping 20 billion records were stolen in a single year, increasing 66% from 12 billion in 2019. Incredibly, this is a 9x increase from the comparatively "small" amount of 2.3 billion records stolen in 2018.  This trend seems to fit an exponential curve; even worse, we are yet to see the fallouts from the end of the year "Solorigate" campaign, which has the potential to marginalize even these numbers by the end of 2021.  Found among the leaked data are usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, bank account details, healthcare information, and other personal data. Malicious actors utilize these treasure troves of information for fraud and further attacks.   In just the first quarter of 2020, the Dutch government managed to lose a hard drive

In the era of hacking and malicious actors, a company's cloud security posture is a concern that preoccupies most, if not all, organizations.  Yet even more than that, it is the SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) that is critical to today's company security. Recently Malwarebytes released a statement on how they were targeted by Nation-State Actors implicated in SolarWinds breach. Their investigation suggested abuse of privileged access to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure environments.  Often left unsecured, it's SaaS setting errors like misconfigurations, inadequate legacy protocols, insufficient identity checks, credential access, and key management that leave companies open to account hijacking, insider threats, and other types of leaks or breaches in the organization.&nbsp;  Gartner has defined &nbsp;the SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) category in 2020's Gartner Hype Cycle for Cloud Security as solutions that continuously assess the security risk and manage SaaS a

Phishing and Malware  Among the major cyber threats, the malware remains a significant danger. The 2017 WannaCry outbreak that cost businesses worldwide up to $4 billion is still in recent memory, and other new strains of malware are discovered on a daily basis.  Phishing has also seen a resurgence in the last few years, with many new scams being invented to take advantage of unsuspecting companies. Just one variation, the CEO Fraud email scam, cost UK businesses alone £14.8m in 2018.  Working From Home  Staff working from home are outside the direct oversight of IT support teams and often struggle to deal with cyber threats and appropriately protect company information.  Failing to update software and operating systems, sending data over insecure networks, and increasing reliance on email and online messaging has made employees far more susceptible to threats ranging from malware to phishing.

Guide: How Security Consolidation Helps Small Cybersecurity Teams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/guide-how-security-consolidation-helps.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The dynamic nature of cybersecurity, the changes in the threat landscape, and the expansion of the attack surface lead organizations to add more security solutions—from different vendors—creating a layered security infrastructure that introduces new challenges to any team, with a much more significant impact on small ones.  And yet, sophisticated attacks continue to bypass these advanced security layers while FOMO (fear of missing out) compels security teams to evaluate every new solution that comes out.  A new guide, "How Security Consolidation Helps Small Security Teams" ( download here ), reviews the challenges of a layered, multi-vendor security approach for protecting your internal environment and reveals why the concept of consolidation of security solutions is becoming the go-to security approach of many CISOs with small teams.  Having a single consolidated solution for protecting your internal environment can free up much of your small team's time and reduce your

Security Operations is a 24 x 7 job. It does not stop for weekends or holidays or even that much-needed coffee break after the first hour of the shift is complete. We all know this.  Every SOC engineer is hoping for some rest at some point. One of my favorite jokes when talking about Security Operations is "3 SOC engineers walked into a bar…" That the joke. No SOC engineers have time to do that. They get it. They laugh. So why is this all true?  Let us explore that a little bit.   Demand for experienced SOC engineers far surpasses the available talent.  Event volume levels boggle the imagination compared to even just a few years ago.  Utilization of tools to their utmost capability has often not been a priority.&nbsp;   In the Security Operations space, we have been using SIEM's for many years with varying degrees of deployments, customization, and effectiveness. For the most part, they have been a helpful tool for Security Operations. But they can be better. Like any tool, t

The pressure on small to medium-sized enterprises to protect their organizations against cyberthreats is astronomical. These businesses face the same threats as the largest enterprises, experience the same (relative) damages and consequences when breaches occur as the largest enterprises but are forced to protect their organizations with a fraction of the resources as the largest enterprises.&nbsp;  Cybersecurity company Cynet just released findings from a survey of 200 CISOs in charge of small security teams ( Download here ) to shine "a spotlight into the challenges of small security teams everywhere."  In addition to better understanding the challenges these CISOs face, the 2021 Survey of CISOs with Small Security Teams delves into the strategies CISOs will employ to ensure their organizations are protected from the ongoing onslaught of cyber threats - all while saddled with limited budgets and headcount.

Nation-state hacker groups mounted attacks against organizations involved in the coronavirus pandemic response, including the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some in an attempt to politicize the pandemic.  Even garden-variety cyber attacks like email phishing, social engineering, and refund theft took on a darker flavor in response to the widespread economic precarity brought on by the pandemic.&nbsp;  "Hackers were mostly trying to take advantage of people's fear by offering medical equipment like thermometers and masks for cheap, low

In the Wake of the SolarWinds Hack, Here's How Businesses Should Respond<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/in-wake-of-solarwinds-hack-heres-how.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Throughout 2020, businesses, in general, have had their hands full with IT challenges. They had to rush to accommodate a sudden shift to remote work. Then they had to navigate a rapid adoption of automation technologies.  And as the year came to a close, more businesses began trying to assemble the safety infrastructure required to return to some semblance of normal in 2021.  But at the end of the year,&nbsp; news of a massive breach &nbsp;of IT monitoring software vendor SolarWinds introduced a new complication – the possibility of a wave of secondary data breaches and cyber-attacks. And because SolarWinds' products have a presence in so many business networks, the size of the threat is massive.  So far, though, most of the attention is getting paid to large enterprises like Microsoft and Cisco (and the US Government), who were the primary target of the SolarWinds breach.

Most companies with small security teams face the same issues. They have inadequate budgets, inadequate staff, and inadequate skills to face today's onslaught of sophisticated cyberthreats.  Many of these companies turn to virtual CISOs (vCISOs) to provide security expertise and guidance. vCISOs are typically former CISOs with years of experience building and managing information security programs across large and small organizations.  Autonomous XDR company Cynet, a provider of an automated breach protection platform and MDR service for even the smallest security teams, is conducting a webinar with well-known vCISO Brian Haugli to understand the common challenges faced by CISOs with small security teams [ register here ].  In the first part of the webinar, Haugli will share the four foundational risks that are common across most companies he helps.

Enhancing Email Security with MTA-STS and SMTP TLS Reporting<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/enhancing-email-security-with-mta-sts.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In 1982, when SMTP was first specified, it did not contain any mechanism for providing security at the transport level to secure communications between mail transfer agents.  Later, in 1999, the STARTTLS command was added to SMTP that in turn supported the encryption of emails in between the servers, providing the ability to convert a non-secure connection into a secure one that is encrypted using TLS protocol.  However, encryption is optional in SMTP, which implies that emails can be sent in plaintext.&nbsp; Mail Transfer Agent-Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) &nbsp;is a relatively new standard that enables mail service providers the ability to enforce Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure SMTP connections and to specify whether the sending SMTP servers should refuse to deliver emails to MX hosts that that does not offer TLS with a reliable server certificate. It has been proven to successfully mitigate TLS downgrade attacks and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.  SMTP TLS Reporting (TLS-

Pen Testing By Numbers: Tracking Pen Testing Trends and Challenges<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/pen-testing-by-numbers-tracking-pen.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Over the years,&nbsp; penetration testing &nbsp;has had to change and adapt alongside the IT environments and technology that need to be assessed.  Broad cybersecurity issues often influence the strategy and growth of pen-testing. In such a fast-paced field, organizations get real value from learning about others' penetration testing experiences, identifying trends, and the role they play in today's threat landscape.  While there is much to be gained from a single snapshot, additional value can come from long term data collection and year over year comparisons. We can see whether the effects that recent trends have on pen testing are long term, or simply a temporary shift, and how they affect the continuing evolution of penetration testing. For instance, 2020 saw a massive influx of remote work.  Unfortunately, the convenience of working safely from home increased the risk of a breach as countless new attack vectors opened up, both from the way employees connected to networks, as well a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Like it or not, 2020 was the year that proved that teams could work from literally anywhere.  While terms like "flex work" and "WFH" were thrown around before COVID-19 came around, thanks to the pandemic, remote working has become the defacto way people work nowadays. Today, digital-based work interactions take the place of in-person ones with near-seamless fluidity, and the best part is that going remote helps companies save their cash in this bootstrapped time.&nbsp;  But while the ability to work from anywhere has truly been essential to keeping businesses and the economy functional, it has opened up new challenges that need to be addressed.&nbsp;  Your Devices Are Your Weakest Link  With nearly ⅔ of employees still working remotely to some degree, the boundaries that once separated work and home have been completely washed away. A major ramification of this shift has been an increase in the volume of corporate and non-corporate devices connecting from remote to sensitive

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
End-user passwords are one of the weakest components of your overall security protocols. Most users tend to reuse passwords across work and personal accounts.  They may also choose relatively weak passwords that satisfy company password policies but can be easily guessed or brute-forced. Your users may also inadvertently use&nbsp; breached passwords &nbsp;for their corporate account password.  The&nbsp; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) &nbsp;has a cybersecurity framework that helps organizations address common cybersecurity pitfalls in their environment, including weak, reused, and breached passwords. This post will take a closer look at the NIST password guidelines and see how you can effectively audit your password policies to ensure these meet the standards recommended by NIST.  NIST Password Guidelines and Best Practices  Specific guidance around passwords is addressed within the chapter titled&nbsp; Memorized Secret Verifiers .
