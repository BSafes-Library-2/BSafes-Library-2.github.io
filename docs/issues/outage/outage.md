Orange Spain Faces BGP Traffic Hijack After RIPE Account Hacked by Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/01/orange-spain-faces-bgp-traffic-hijack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mobile network operator Orange Spain suffered an internet outage for several hours on January 3 after a threat actor used administrator credentials captured by means of stealer malware to hijack the border gateway protocol ( BGP ) traffic. "The Orange account in the IP network coordination center (RIPE) has suffered improper access that has affected the browsing of some of our customers," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a message posted on X (formerly Twitter). However, the company emphasized no personal data was compromised and that the incident only affected some browsing services. The threat actor, who goes by the name Ms_Snow_OwO on X,&nbsp; claimed &nbsp;to have gained access to Orange Spain's RIPE account. RIPE is a regional Internet registry ( RIR ) that oversees the allocation and registration of IP addresses and autonomous system (AS) numbers in Europe, Central Asia, Russia, and West Asia.

Mandiant's Twitter Account Restored After Six-Hour Crypto Scam Hack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/01/mandiants-twitter-account-restored.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
American cybersecurity firm and Google Cloud subsidiary Mandiant had its X (formerly Twitter) account compromised for more than six hours by an unknown attacker to propagate a cryptocurrency scam. As of writing, the&nbsp; account has been restored &nbsp;on the social media platform. It's currently not clear how the account was breached. But the hacked Mandiant account was initially renamed to "@phantomsolw" to impersonate the Phantom crypto wallet service, according to&nbsp; MalwareHunterTeam &nbsp;and&nbsp; vx-underground . Specifically, the scam posts from the account advertised an airdrop scam that urged users to click on a bogus link and earn free tokens, with follow-up messages asking Mandiant to "change password please" and "check bookmarks when you get account back." Mandiant, a leading threat intelligence firm, was&nbsp; acquired by Google &nbsp;in March 2022 for $5.4 billion. It is now part of Google Cloud.

PyPI Repository Under Attack: User Sign-Ups and Package Uploads Temporarily Halted<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/pypi-repository-under-attack-user-sign.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The maintainers of Python Package Index (PyPI), the official third-party software repository for the Python programming language, have temporarily disabled the ability for users to sign up and upload new packages until further notice. "The volume of malicious users and malicious projects being created on the index in the past week has outpaced our ability to respond to it in a timely fashion, especially with multiple PyPI administrators on leave," the admins&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a notice published on May 20, 2023. No additional details about the nature of the malware and threat actors involved in publishing those rogue packages to PyPI were disclosed. The decision to freeze new user and project registrations comes as software registries such as PyPI have proven time and time again to be a popular target for attackers looking to poison the software supply chain and compromise developer environments. Earlier this week, Israeli cybersecurity startup Phylum&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;an active malwa

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Amid the&nbsp; ongoing war &nbsp;between Russia and Ukraine, government, agriculture, and transportation organizations located in Donetsk, Lugansk, and Crimea have been attacked as part of an active campaign that drops a previously unseen, modular framework dubbed&nbsp; CommonMagic . "Although the initial vector of compromise is unclear, the details of the next stage imply the use of spear phishing or similar methods," Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. The Russian cybersecurity company, which detected the attacks in October 2022, is tracking the activity cluster under the name "Bad Magic." Attack chains entail the use of booby-trapped URLS pointing to a ZIP archive hosted on a malicious web server. The file, when opened, contains a decoy document and a malicious LNK file that culminates in the deployment of a backdoor named PowerMagic. Written in PowerShell, PowerMagic establishes contact with a remote server and executes arbitrary commands, the results of which are exfiltra

A number of websites belonging to the Israeli government were felled in a distributed denial-of-service ( DDoS ) attack on Monday, rendering the portals inaccessible for a short period of time.  "In the past few hours, a DDoS attack against a communications provider was identified," the Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a tweet. "As a result, access to several websites, among them government websites, was denied for a short time. As of now, all of the websites have returned to normal activity."   A distributed denial-of-service attack is a malicious attempt to hamper the normal traffic of a targeted server or service by overwhelming the victim and its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of junk internet traffic by leveraging compromised computers and IoT devices as sources of attack traffic.
