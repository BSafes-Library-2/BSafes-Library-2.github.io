The maintainers of Python Package Index (PyPI), the official third-party software repository for the Python programming language, have temporarily disabled the ability for users to sign up and upload new packages until further notice. "The volume of malicious users and malicious projects being created on the index in the past week has outpaced our ability to respond to it in a timely fashion, especially with multiple PyPI administrators on leave," the admins&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a notice published on May 20, 2023. No additional details about the nature of the malware and threat actors involved in publishing those rogue packages to PyPI were disclosed. The decision to freeze new user and project registrations comes as software registries such as PyPI have proven time and time again to be a popular target for attackers looking to poison the software supply chain and compromise developer environments.

Amid the&nbsp; ongoing war &nbsp;between Russia and Ukraine, government, agriculture, and transportation organizations located in Donetsk, Lugansk, and Crimea have been attacked as part of an active campaign that drops a previously unseen, modular framework dubbed&nbsp; CommonMagic . "Although the initial vector of compromise is unclear, the details of the next stage imply the use of spear phishing or similar methods," Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. The Russian cybersecurity company, which detected the attacks in October 2022, is tracking the activity cluster under the name "Bad Magic." Attack chains entail the use of booby-trapped URLS pointing to a ZIP archive hosted on a malicious web server. The file, when opened, contains a decoy document and a malicious LNK file that culminates in the deployment of a backdoor named PowerMagic. Written in PowerShell, PowerMagic establishes contact with a remote server and executes arbitrary commands, the results of which are exfiltra

A number of websites belonging to the Israeli government were felled in a distributed denial-of-service ( DDoS ) attack on Monday, rendering the portals inaccessible for a short period of time.  "In the past few hours, a DDoS attack against a communications provider was identified," the Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a tweet. "As a result, access to several websites, among them government websites, was denied for a short time. As of now, all of the websites have returned to normal activity."   A distributed denial-of-service attack is a malicious attempt to hamper the normal traffic of a targeted server or service by overwhelming the victim and its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of junk internet traffic by leveraging compromised computers and IoT devices as sources of attack traffic.

Other signs read, "Free gas in Jamaran gas station," with gas pumps showing the words "cyberattack 64411" when attempting to purchase fuel, semi-official Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA) news agency&nbsp; reported .   Abolhassan Firouzabadi, the head of Iran's Supreme Cyberspace Council,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the attacks were "probably" state-sponsored but added it was too early to determine which country carried out the intrusions.

Colonial Pipeline , which carries 45% of the fuel consumed on the U.S. East Coast, on Saturday said it halted operations due to a ransomware attack,&nbsp; once again demonstrating &nbsp;how infrastructure is vulnerable to cyberattacks.  "On May 7, the Colonial Pipeline Company learned it was the victim of a cybersecurity attack," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement posted on its website. "We have since determined that this incident involves ransomware. In response, we proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat, which has temporarily halted all pipeline operations, and affected some of our IT systems."   Colonial Pipeline is the largest refined products pipeline in the U.S., a 5,500 mile (8,851 km) system involved in transporting over 100 million gallons from the Texas city of Houston to New York Harbor.  Cybersecurity firm FireEye's Mandiant incident response division is said to be assisting with the investigation, according to reports from&nbsp; Bloomberg
