Some aspects of the malware were&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) earlier in August, highlighting unsuccessful attempts on part of the adversary to penetrate Ukrainian military networks and gather valuable intelligence. It's said that Russian forces captured tablets used by Ukraine on the battlefield, using them as a foothold to remotely disseminate the malware to other devices by using the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ) command-line tool.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing attack likely targeting civil society groups in South Korea has led to the discovery of a novel remote access trojan called&nbsp; SuperBear . The intrusion singled out an unnamed activist, who was contacted in late August 2023 and received a malicious LNK file from an address impersonating a member of the organization, non-profit entity Interlabs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. The LNK file, upon execution, launches a PowerShell command to execute a Visual Basic script that, in turn, fetches the next-stage payloads from a legitimate but compromised WordPress website. This includes the Autoit3.exe binary ("solmir.pdb") and an AutoIt script ("solmir_1.pdb") that's launched using the former. The AutoIt script, for its part, performs process injection using a&nbsp; process hollowing technique , in which malicious code is inserted into a process that's in a suspended state. In this case, an instance of Explorer.exe is spawned to inject a never-before-seen RAT referred to as SuperBear th

"Information-stealing malware like SapphireStealer can be used to obtain sensitive information, including corporate credentials, which are often resold to other threat actors who leverage the access for additional attacks, including operations related to espionage or ransomware/extortion," Cisco Talos researcher Edmund Brumaghin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. An entire ecosystem has developed over time that allows both financially motivated and nation-state actors to use services from purveyors of stealer malware to carry out various kinds of attacks. Viewed in that light, such malware not only represents an evolution of the cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS) model, they also offer other threat actors to monetize the stolen data to distribute ransomware, conduct data theft, and other maliciou

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Three additional rogue Python packages have been discovered in the Package Index (PyPI) repository as part of an ongoing malicious software supply chain campaign called&nbsp; VMConnect , with signs pointing to the involvement of North Korean state-sponsored threat actors. The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;come from ReversingLabs, which detected the packages tablediter, request-plus, and requestspro. First disclosed at the start of the month by the company and Sonatype,&nbsp; VMConnect &nbsp;refers to a collection of Python packages that mimic popular open-source Python tools to download an unknown second-stage malware. The latest tranche is no different, with ReversingLabs noting that the bad actors are disguising their packages and making them appear trustworthy by using typosquatting techniques to impersonate prettytable and requests and confuse developers. The nefarious code within tablediter is designed to run in an endless execution loop in which a remote server is polled periodically to retrieve and execute

A hacking outfit nicknamed&nbsp; Earth Estries &nbsp;has been attributed to a new, ongoing cyber espionage campaign targeting government and technology industries based in the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Africa, Germany, and the U.S. "The threat actors behind Earth Estries are working with high-level resources and functioning with sophisticated skills and experience in cyber espionage and illicit activities," Trend Micro researchers Ted Lee, Lenart Bermejo, Hara Hiroaki, Leon M Chang, and Gilbert Sison&nbsp; said . Active since at least 2020, Earth Estries is said to share tactical overlaps with another nation-state group tracked as&nbsp; FamousSparrow , which was first exposed by ESET in 2021 as exploiting ProxyLogon flaws in Microsoft Exchange Server to penetrate hospitality, government, engineering, and legal sectors.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New findings show that malicious actors could leverage a sneaky malware detection evasion technique and bypass endpoint security solutions by manipulating the Windows Container Isolation Framework. The findings were presented by Deep Instinct security researcher Daniel Avinoam at the&nbsp; DEF CON security conference &nbsp;held earlier this month. Microsoft's&nbsp; container architecture &nbsp;(and by extension,&nbsp; Windows Sandbox ) uses what's called a&nbsp; dynamically generated image &nbsp;to separate the file system from each container to the host and at the same time avoid duplication of system files. It's nothing but an "operating system image that has clean copies of files that can change, but links to files that cannot change that are in the Windows image that already exists on the host," thereby bringing down the overall size for a full OS. "The result is images that contain 'ghost files,' which store no actual data but point to a different volume on the system,"

A previously undocumented Android banking trojan dubbed&nbsp; MMRat &nbsp;has been observed targeting mobile users in Southeast Asia since late June 2023 to remotely commandeer the devices and perform financial fraud. "The malware, named after its distinctive package name com.mm.user, can capture user input and screen content, and can also remotely control victim devices through various techniques, enabling its operators to carry out bank fraud on the victim's device," Trend Micro&nbsp; said . What makes MMRat stand apart from others of its kind is the use of a customized command-and-control (C2) protocol based on protocol buffers (aka&nbsp; protobuf ) to efficiently transfer large volumes of data from compromised handsets, demonstrating the growing sophistication of Android malware. Possible targets based on the language used in the phishing pages include Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, and the Philippines.

Critical Vulnerability Alert: VMware Aria Operations Networks at Risk from Remote Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/critical-vulnerability-alert-vmware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware has released software updates to correct two security vulnerabilities in Aria Operations for Networks that could be potentially exploited to bypass authentication and gain remote code execution. The most severe of the flaws is CVE-2023-34039 (CVSS score: 9.8), which relates to a case of authentication bypass arising as a result of a lack of unique cryptographic key generation. "A malicious actor with network access to Aria Operations for Networks could bypass SSH authentication to gain access to the Aria Operations for Networks CLI," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. ProjectDiscovery researchers Harsh Jaiswal and Rahul Maini have been credited with discovering and reporting the issue. The second weakness, CVE-2023-20890 (CVSS score: 7.2), is an arbitrary file write vulnerability impacting Aria Operations for Networks that could be abused by an adversary with administrative access to write files to arbitrary locations and achieve remote code execution.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coordinated law enforcement effort codenamed&nbsp; Operation Duck Hunt &nbsp;has felled&nbsp; QakBot , a notorious Windows malware family that's estimated to have compromised over 700,000 computers globally and facilitated financial fraud as well as ransomware. To that end, the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ)&nbsp; said &nbsp;the malware is "being deleted from victim computers, preventing it from doing any more harm," adding it seized more than $8.6 million in cryptocurrency in illicit profits. The cross-border exercise involved the participation of France, Germany, Latvia, Romania, the Netherlands, the U.K., and the U.S., alongside technical assistance from cybersecurity company Zscaler. The dismantling has been hailed as "the largest U.S.-led financial and technical disruption of a botnet infrastructure leveraged by cybercriminals." No arrests were announced. QakBot, also known as QBot and Pinkslipbot, started its life as a banking trojan in 2007 before morphing into a general-pu

A suspected Chinese-nexus hacking group exploited a&nbsp; recently disclosed zero-day flaw &nbsp;in Barracuda Networks Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances to breach government, military, defense and aerospace, high-tech industry, and telecom sectors as part of a global espionage campaign. Mandiant, which is tracking the activity under the name&nbsp; UNC4841 , described the threat actor as "highly responsive to defensive efforts" and capable of actively tweaking their modus operandi to maintain persistent access to targets. "UNC4841 deployed new and novel malware designed to maintain presence at a small subset of high priority targets that it compromised either before the patch was released, or shortly following Barracuda's remediation guidance," the Google-owned threat intelligence firm&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new technical report published today. Almost a third of the identified affected organizations are government agencies. Interestingly enough, some of the earliest compromises

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malspam campaign has been observed deploying an off-the-shelf malware called DarkGate . "The current spike in DarkGate malware activity is plausible given the fact that the developer of the malware has recently started to rent out the malware to a limited number of affiliates," Telekom Security&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. The latest report build onn&nbsp; recent findings &nbsp;from security researcher Igal Lytzki, who detailed a "high volume campaign" that leverages hijacked email threads to trick recipients into downloading the malware. The attack commences with a phishing URL that, when clicked, passes through a traffic direction system ( TDS ) to take the victim to an MSI payload subject to certain conditions. This includes the presence of a refresh header in the HTTP response. Opening the MSI file triggers a multi-stage process that incorporates an AutoIt script to execute shellcode that acts as a conduit to decrypt and launch DarkGate via a crypte

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ask any security professional and they'll tell you that remediating risks from various siloed security scanning tools requires a tedious and labor-intensive series of steps focused on deduplication, prioritization, and routing of issues to an appropriate "fixer" somewhere in the organization. This burden on already resource-strapped security teams is an efficiency killer.&nbsp; A new study , commissioned by Seemplicity and conducted by Dark Reading, provides fresh insight into how security pros handle the challenging remediation life cycle from discovery to resolution. The research reveals the obstacles security professionals face when coordinating remediation activities. The data exposes the outcomes — in increased workload and diminished risk posture — that arise from lengthy remediation times, inefficient and uncontrolled manual processes, the lack of managerial visibility and oversight across the risk life cycle.&nbsp; Remediation Process Broken Down to Steps and Time Spent on Each Step

Unpatched Citrix NetScaler systems exposed to the internet are being targeted by unknown threat actors in what's suspected to be a ransomware attack. Cybersecurity company Sophos is&nbsp; tracking &nbsp;the activity cluster under the moniker&nbsp; STAC4663 . Attack chains involve the exploitation of&nbsp; CVE-2023-3519 , a critical code injection vulnerability impacting NetScaler ADC and Gateway servers that could facilitate unauthenticated remote code execution. In one intrusion detected in mid-August 2023, the security flaw is said to have been used to conduct a domain-wide attack, including injecting payloads into legitimate executables such as the Windows Update Agent (wuauclt.exe) and the Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Service (wmiprvse.exe). An analysis of the payload is underway. Other notable aspects include the distribution of obfuscated PowerShell scripts, PHP web shells, and the use of an Estonian service called BlueVPS for malware staging. Sophos said the modus operandi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning of an increase in adversary-in-the-middle ( AiTM ) phishing techniques, which are being propagated as part of the phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) cybercrime model. In addition to an uptick in AiTM-capable PhaaS platforms, the tech giant noted that existing phishing services like PerSwaysion are incorporating AiTM capabilities. "This development in the PhaaS ecosystem enables attackers to conduct high-volume phishing campaigns that attempt to circumvent MFA protections at scale," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). Phishing kits with AiTM capabilities work in two ways, one of which concerns the use of reverse proxy servers (i.e., the phishing page) to relay traffic to and from the client and legitimate website and stealthily capture user credentials, two-factor authentication codes, and session cookies. A second method involves synchronous relay servers. "In AiTM through synchronous relay s

Following responsible disclosure on April 5, 2023, the issue was addressed by Microsoft via an update released a day later. Secureworks has also made available an&nbsp; open-source tool &nbsp;that other organizations can use to scan for abandoned reply URLs.

In yet another sign that developers continue to be targets of software supply chain attacks, a number of malicious packages have been discovered on the Rust programming language's crate registry.

The names of the packages, now taken down, are as follows: postgress, if-cfg, xrvrv, serd, oncecell, lazystatic, and envlogger. It's not clear what the end goal of the campaign was, but the suspicious modules were found to harbor functionalities to capture the operating system information (i.e., Windows, Linux, macOS, or Unknown) and transmit the data to a hard-coded Telegram channel via the messaging platform's API.

KmsdBot Malware Gets an Upgrade: Now Targets IoT Devices with Enhanced Capabilities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/kmsdbot-malware-gets-upgrade-now.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An updated version of a botnet malware called&nbsp; KmsdBot &nbsp;is now targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices, simultaneously branching out its capabilities and the attack surface. "The binary now includes support for&nbsp; Telnet scanning &nbsp;and support for more CPU architectures," Akamai security researcher Larry W. Cashdollar&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published this month. The latest iteration, observed since July 16, 2023, comes months after it emerged that the botnet is being offered as a&nbsp; DDoS-for-hire service &nbsp;to other threat actors. The fact that it's being actively maintained indicates its effectiveness in real-world attacks. KmsdBot was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by the web infrastructure and security company in November 2022. It's mainly designed to target private gaming servers and cloud hosting providers, although it has since set its eyes on some Romanian government and Spanish educational sites. The malware is designed to scan random IP addresses for open SSH ports and

LockBit 3.0 Ransomware Builder Leak Gives Rise to Hundreds of New Variants<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/lockbit-30-ransomware-builder-leak.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The leak of the&nbsp; LockBit 3.0 ransomware &nbsp;builder last year has led to threat actors abusing the tool to spawn new variants. Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky said it detected a ransomware intrusion that deployed a version of LockBit but with a markedly different ransom demand procedure. "The attacker behind this incident decided to use a different ransom note with a headline related to a previously unknown group, called NATIONAL HAZARD AGENCY," security researchers Eduardo Ovalle and Francesco Figurelli&nbsp; said . The revamped ransom note directly specified the amount to be paid to obtain the decryption keys, and directed communications to a Tox service and email, unlike the LockBit group, which doesn't mention the amount and uses its own communication and negotiation platform. NATIONAL HAZARD AGENCY is far from the only cybercrime gang to use the leaked LockBit 3.0 builder. Some of the other threat actors known to leverage it include&nbsp; Bl00dy and Buhti . Kaspersk

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Risk and financial advisory solutions provider Kroll on Friday disclosed that one of its employees fell victim to a "highly sophisticated" SIM swapping attack. The incident, which took place on August 19, 2023, targeted the employee's T-Mobile account, the company said. "Specifically, T-Mobile, without any authority from or contact with Kroll or its employee, transferred that employee's phone number to the threat actor's phone at their request," it&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. This enabled the unidentified actor to gain access to certain files containing personal information of bankruptcy claimants in the matters of BlockFi , FTX , and Genesis. SIM swapping (aka SIM splitting or simjacking), while generally a benign process, could be exploited by threat actors to fraudulently activate a SIM card under their control with a victim's phone number. This makes it possible to intercept SMS messages and voice calls and receive MFA-related messages that cont

Every company has some level of tech debt. Unless you're a brand new start-up, you most likely have a patchwork of solutions that have been implemented throughout the years, often under various leadership teams with different priorities and goals. As those technologies age, they can leave your organization vulnerable to cyber threats. While replacing legacy technologies can be costly, those costs may pale in comparison to a breach – both in terms of immediate financial impact and reputational damage.&nbsp; Here are three ways you can communicate risk to your leadership team as you work to replace legacy infrastructure. 1: Make the Risk Real Leadership teams are driven by quantifiable business implications. The best way to get support for updating or replacing legacy technology is to make the risk to the business real - and measurable - in a language they understand. One way to do this is to look at the list of critical vulnerabilities that you've identified, then evaluate the impact t

"Flax Typhoon gains and maintains long-term access to Taiwanese organizations' networks with minimal use of malware, relying on tools built into the operating system, along with some normally benign software to quietly remain in these networks," the company&nbsp; said . It further said it hasn't observed the group weaponize the access to conduct data-collection and exfiltration.

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning that Barracuda Networks Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances patched against a recently disclosed critical flaw continue to be at risk of potential compromise from suspected Chinese hacking groups. It also&nbsp; deemed &nbsp;the fixes as "ineffective" and that it "continues to observe active intrusions and considers all affected Barracuda ESG appliances to be compromised and vulnerable to this exploit." Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-2868 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the zero-day bug is said to have been weaponized as early as October 2022, more than seven months before the security hole was plugged.

The North Korea-linked threat actor known as Lazarus Group has been observed exploiting a now-patched critical security flaw impacting Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus to distribute a remote access trojan called such as&nbsp; QuiteRAT .

What's more, a closer examination of the adversary's recycled attack infrastructure in its cyber assaults on enterprises has led to the discovery of a new threat dubbed&nbsp; CollectionRAT . The fact that the Lazarus Group continues to rely on the same tradecraft despite those components being well-documented over the years underscores the threat actor's confidence in their operations, Talos pointed out. QuiteRAT is said to be a successor to&nbsp; MagicRAT , itself a follow-up to TigerRAT, while CollectionRAT appears to share overlaps with&nbsp; EarlyRAT &nbsp;(aka&nbsp; Jupiter ), an im

Public Wi-Fi, which has long since become the norm, poses threats to not only individual users but also businesses. With the rise of remote work, people can now work from virtually anywhere: a cafe close to home, a hotel in a different city, or even while waiting for a plane at the airport. Next, let's explore the risks of connecting to public Wi-Fi, both for you personally and for businesses. According to the&nbsp; Forbes Advisor &nbsp;the majority of people (56%) connect to public Wi-Fi networks that don't require a password. This convenience comes at a price, and many are unaware that attackers can steal card details, passwords, and other sensitive information. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: &nbsp;This is one of the most common threats on public Wi-Fi. In an MITM attack, the hacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties.

The SmokeLoader malware is being used to deliver a new Wi-Fi scanning malware strain called&nbsp; Whiffy Recon &nbsp;on compromised Windows machines. "The new malware strain has only one operation. Every 60 seconds it triangulates the infected systems' positions by scanning nearby Wi-Fi access points as a data point for Google's geolocation API," Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement shared with The Hacker News. "The location returned by Google's&nbsp; Geolocation API &nbsp;is then sent back to the adversary." SmokeLoader , as the name implies, is a loader malware whose sole purpose is to drop additional payloads onto a host. Since 2014, the malware has been&nbsp; offered for sale &nbsp;to Russian-based threat actors. It's traditionally distributed via phishing emails. Whiffy Recon works by checking for the WLAN AutoConfig service (WLANSVC) on the infected system and terminating itself if the service name doesn't exist. It's worth noting that th

A recently patched security flaw in the popular WinRAR archiving software has been exploited as a zero-day since April 2023, new findings from Group-IB reveal. The vulnerability, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38831 , allows threat actors to spoof file extensions, thereby making it possible to launch malicious scripts contained within an archive that masquerades as seemingly innocuous image or text files. It was addressed in&nbsp; version 6.23 &nbsp;released on August 2, 2023, alongside CVE-2023-40477. In attacks discovered by the Singapore-based firm in July 2023, specially crafted ZIP or RAR archive files distributed via trading-related forums such as Forex Station have been used to deliver a variety of malware families such as DarkMe,&nbsp; GuLoader , and&nbsp; Remcos RAT . "After infecting devices, the cybercriminals withdraw money from broker accounts," Group-IB malware analyst Andrey Polovinkin&nbsp; said , adding as many as 130 traders' devices have been compromised as part of the campaign.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Thousands of&nbsp; Openfire XMPP servers &nbsp;are unpatched against a recently disclosed high-severity flaw and are susceptible to a new exploit, according to a&nbsp; new report &nbsp;from VulnCheck. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-32315 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5), the vulnerability relates to a path traversal vulnerability in Openfire's administrative console that could permit an unauthenticated attacker to access otherwise restricted pages reserved for privileged users. It affects all versions of the software released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0. It was remediated by its developer, Ignite Realtime, earlier this May with the release of versions 4.6.8, 4.7.5, and 4.8.0. "Path traversal protections were already in place to protect against exactly this kind of attack, but didn't defend against certain non-standard URL encoding for UTF-16 characters that were not supported by the embedded web server that was in use at the time," the maintainers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a detailed advisory.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) on Wednesday&nbsp; unsealed an indictment &nbsp;against two founders of the now-sanctioned Tornado Cash cryptocurrency mixer service, charging them with laundering more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds. Both the individuals, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Storm, 34, is said to have been arrested in the U.S. state of Washington. Semenov, 35, remains at large in Dubai. They are alleged to have "made millions of dollars in profits" from promoting and operating the service. Tornado Cash is estimated to have processed upwards of $7 billion worth of crypto assets over a period of three years. In a related move, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned &nbsp;Semenov and&nbsp; eight cryptocurrency addresses &nbsp;connected to him, days after a U.S. cou

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Tuesday warned that threat actors affiliated with North Korea may attempt to cash out stolen cryptocurrency worth more than $40 million. The law enforcement agency&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the blockchain activity to an adversary the U.S. government tracks as TraderTraitor, which is also known by the name Jade Sleet. An investigation undertaken by the FBI found that the group moved approximately 1,580 bitcoin from several cryptocurrency heists over the past 24 hours and are currently said to be holding those funds in six different wallets. North Korea is known to blur the lines among cyber warfare, espionage, and financial crime.&nbsp; TraderTraitor , in particular, has been linked to a series of attacks targeting blockchain and cryptocurrency exchanges with the goal of plundering digital assets to generate illicit revenue for the sanctions-hit nation. This includes the $60 million theft of virtual currency from Alphapo on June 22, 2023; the $37 m

A Syrian threat actor named&nbsp; EVLF &nbsp;has been outed as the creator of malware families CypherRAT and CraxsRAT.

CypherRAT and CraxsRAT are said to be offered to other cybercriminals as part of a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) scheme. As many as 100 unique threat actors are estimated to have purchased the twin tools on a lifetime license over the past three years. EVLF is said to be operating a web shop to advertise their warez since at least September 2022. CraxsRAT is billed as an Android trojan that enables a threat actor to remote control an infected device from a Windows computer, with the developer consistently releasing new updates based on feedback from the customers.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious toolset dubbed&nbsp; Spacecolon &nbsp;is being deployed as part of an ongoing campaign to spread variants of the Scarab ransomware across victim organizations globally. "It probably finds its way into victim organizations by its operators compromising vulnerable web servers or via brute forcing RDP credentials," ESET security researcher Jakub Souček&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a detailed technical write-up published Tuesday. The Slovak cybersecurity firm, which dubbed the threat actor CosmicBeetle, said the origins of the Spacecolon date back to May 2020. The highest concentration of victims has been detected in France, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and Turkey. While the exact provenance of the adversary is unclear, several Spacecolon variants are said to contain Turkish strings, likely pointing to the involvement of a Turkish-speaking developer. There is no evidence currently linking it to any other known threat actor group. Some of the targets include a hospital and a tourist reso

More than a dozen malicious packages have been discovered on the npm package repository since the start of August 2023 with capabilities to deploy an open-source information stealer called&nbsp; Luna Token Grabber &nbsp;on systems belonging to Roblox developers. The ongoing campaign, first detected on August 1 by ReversingLabs, employs modules that masquerade as the legitimate package&nbsp; noblox.js , an API wrapper that's used to create scripts that interact with the Roblox gaming platform. The software supply chain security company described the activity as a "replay of an attack&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;two years ago" in October 2021. "The malicious packages [...] reproduce code from the legitimate noblox.js package but add malicious, information-stealing functions," software threat researcher Lucija Valentić&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. The packages were cumulatively downloaded 963 times before they were taken down. The names of the rogue packages are as follows - noblox.js-v

And at first glance, respondents appear generally optimistic about their SaaS cybersecurity. Over 600 IT, cybersecurity, and business leaders at companies between 500-2,500+ employees were surveyed and responded with confidence in their SaaS cybersecurity preparedness and capabilities. For example: When asked to rate the SaaS cybersecurity maturity level of their organizations, 71% noted that their organizations' SaaS cybersecurity maturity has achieved either a mid-high level (43%) or the highest level (28%). For the security levels of the SaaS applications authorized for use in their organization, sentiment was similarly high.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented threat cluster has been linked to a software supply chain attack targeting organizations primarily located in Hong Kong and other regions in Asia. The Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, is tracking the activity under its insect-themed moniker Carderbee. The attacks, per the cybersecurity firm, leverage a trojanized version of a legitimate software called EsafeNet Cobra DocGuard Client to deliver a known backdoor called&nbsp; PlugX &nbsp;(aka Korplug) on victim networks. "In the course of this attack, the attackers used malware signed with a legitimate Microsoft certificate," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The use of Cobra DocGuard Client to pull off a supply chain attack was previously highlighted by ESET in its&nbsp; quarterly Threat Report &nbsp;this year, detailing a September 2022 intrusion in which an unnamed gambling company in Hong Kong was compromised via a malicious update pushed by the software.

A new variant of an&nbsp; Apple macOS malware &nbsp;called&nbsp; XLoader &nbsp;has surfaced in the wild, masquerading its malicious features under the guise of an office productivity app called "OfficeNote." "The new version of XLoader is bundled inside a standard Apple disk image with the name OfficeNote.dmg," SentinelOne security researchers Dinesh Devadoss and Phil Stokes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday analysis. "The application contained within is signed with the developer signature MAIT JAKHU (54YDV8NU9C)." XLoader , first detected in 2020, is&nbsp; considered &nbsp;a successor to Formbook and is an information stealer and keylogger offered under the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model. A macOS variant of the malware emerged in July 2021, distributed as a Java program in the form of a compiled .JAR file.

Software services provider Ivanti is&nbsp; warning &nbsp;of a new critical zero-day flaw impacting Ivanti Sentry (formerly MobileIron Sentry) that it said is being actively exploited in the wild, marking an escalation of its security woes. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38035 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the issue has been described as a case of authentication bypass impacting versions 9.18 and prior due to what it called an due to an insufficiently restrictive Apache HTTPD configuration. "If exploited, this vulnerability enables an unauthenticated actor to access some sensitive APIs that are used to configure the Ivanti Sentry on the administrator portal (port 8443, commonly MICS)," the company&nbsp; said . "While the issue has a high CVSS score, there is a low risk of exploitation for customers who do not expose port 8443 to the internet." Successful exploitation of the bug could allow an attacker to change configuration, run system commands, or write files onto the system. It's recommen

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; added &nbsp;a critical security flaw in Adobe ColdFusion to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. The vulnerability, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-26359 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), relates to a deserialization flaw present in Adobe ColdFusion 2018 (Update 15 and earlier) and ColdFusion 2021 (Update 5 and earlier) that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user without requiring any interaction. Deserialization &nbsp;(aka unmarshaling) refers to the process of reconstructing a data structure or an object from a byte stream. But when it's performed without validating its source or sanitizing its contents, it can lead to&nbsp; unexpected consequences &nbsp;such as code execution or denial-of-service (DoS). It was&nbsp; patched &nbsp;by Adobe as part of updates issued in March 2023. As of writing, it's immediately not clear how the flaw is being&nbsp; abused in the wil

A high-severity security flaw has been disclosed in the WinRAR utility that could be potentially exploited by a threat actor to achieve remote code execution on Windows systems. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-40477 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), the vulnerability has been described as a case of improper validation while processing recovery volumes. "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer," the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process." Successful exploitation of the flaw requires user interaction in that the target must be lured into visiting a malicious page or by simply opening a booby-trapped archive file. A security researcher, who goes by the alias goodbyeselene, has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on June 8, 2023. The issue has been address

How to Investigate an OAuth Grant for Suspicious Activity or Overly Permissive Scopes<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/how-to-investigate-oauth-grant-for.html"> Full Text</a>

From a user's perspective, OAuth works like magic. In just a few keystrokes, you can whisk through the account creation process and gain immediate access to whatever new app or integration you're seeking. Unfortunately, few users understand the implications of the permissions they allow when they create a new OAuth grant, making it easy for malicious actors to manipulate employees into giving away unintended access to corporate environments. In one of the&nbsp; highest-profile examples , Pawn Storm's attacks against the Democratic National Convention and others leveraged OAuth to target victims through social engineering.&nbsp; Security and IT teams would be wise to establish a practice of reviewing new and existing OAuth grants programmatically to catch risky activity or overly-permissive scopes. And, there are new solutions for&nbsp; SaaS security &nbsp;cropping up that can make this process easier. Let's take a look at some best practices for prioritizing and investigating your organization's grants

Threat actors are leveraging access to malware-infected Windows and macOS machines to deliver a proxy server application and use them as exit nodes to reroute proxy requests. According to AT&amp;T Alien Labs, the unnamed company that offers the proxy service operates more than 400,000 proxy exit nodes, although it's not immediately clear how many of them were co-opted by malware installed on infected machines without user knowledge and interaction. "Although the proxy website claims that its exit nodes come only from users who have been informed and agreed to the use of their device," the cybersecurity company&nbsp; said &nbsp;it found evidence where "malware writers are installing the proxy silently in infected systems." Multiple malware families have been observed delivering the proxy to users searching for cracked software and games.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind the HiatusRAT malware have returned from their hiatus with a new wave of reconnaissance and targeting activity aimed at Taiwan-based organizations and a U.S. military procurement system. Besides recompiling malware samples for different architectures, the artifacts are said to have been hosted on new virtual private servers (VPSs), Lumen Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. The cybersecurity firm described the activity cluster as "brazen" and "one of the most audacious," indicating no signs of slowing down. The identity and the origin of the threat actors are presently unknown. Targets included commercial firms, such as semiconductor and chemical manufacturers, and at least one municipal government organization in Taiwan as well as a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) server associated with submitting and retrieving proposals for defense contracts.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed an updated version of an advanced fingerprinting and redirection toolkit called&nbsp; WoofLocker &nbsp;that's engineered to conduct tech support scams. The sophisticated traffic redirection scheme was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Malwarebytes in January 2020, leveraging JavaScript embedded in compromised websites to perform anti-bot and web traffic filtering checks to serve next-stage JavaScript that redirects users to a browser locker (aka browlock). This redirection mechanism, in turn, makes use of steganographic tricks to conceal the JavaScript code within a PNG image that's served only when the validation phase is successful. Should a user be detected as a bot or not interesting traffic, a decoy PNG file without the malicious code is used. WoofLocker is also known as 404Browlock due to the fact that visiting the browlock URL directly without the appropriate redirection or one-time session token results in a 404 error page.

Networking hardware company Juniper Networks has released an "out-of-cycle" security update to address multiple flaws in the J-Web component of Junos OS that could be combined to achieve remote code execution on susceptible installations. The four vulnerabilities have a cumulative CVSS rating of 9.8, making them Critical in severity. They affect all versions of Junos OS on SRX and EX Series. "By chaining exploitation of these vulnerabilities, an unauthenticated, network-based attacker may be able to remotely execute code on the devices," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory released on August 17, 2023. The J-Web interface allows users to configure, manage, and monitor Junos OS devices. A brief description of the flaws is as follows - CVE-2023-36844 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-36845 &nbsp;(CVSS scores: 5.3) - Two PHP external variable modification vulnerabilities in J-Web of Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX Series and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to

Thousands of Android Malware Apps Using Stealthy APK Compression to Evade Detection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/thousands-of-android-malware-apps-using.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are using Android Package (APK) files with unknown or unsupported compression methods to elude malware analysis. That's according to findings from Zimperium, which found 3,300 artifacts leveraging such compression algorithms in the wild. 71 of the identified samples can be loaded on the operating system without any problems. There is no evidence that the apps were available on the Google Play Store at any point in time, indicating that the apps were distributed through other means, typically via untrusted app stores or social engineering to trick the victims into sideloading them. The APK files use "a technique that limits the possibility of decompiling the application for a large number of tools, reducing the possibilities of being analyzed," security researcher Fernando Ortega&nbsp; said . "In order to do that, the APK (which is in essence a ZIP file), is using an unsupported decompression method." The advantage of such an approach is its abilit

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coordinated law enforcement operation across 25 African countries has led to the arrest of 14 suspected cybercriminals, INTERPOL&nbsp; announced &nbsp;Friday. The exercise, conducted in partnership with AFRIPOL, enabled investigators to identify 20,674 cyber networks that were linked to financial losses of more than $40 million. "The four-month Africa Cyber Surge II operation was launched in April 2023 and focused on identifying cybercriminals and compromised infrastructure," the agency said. As part of the operation, three suspects were arrested in Cameroon in connection with an online scam involving the fraudulent sale of works of art worth $850,000. Another suspect was arrested in Nigeria for defrauding a Gambian victim. Also arrested were two money mules linked to scams initiated through messaging platforms. The cyber networks comprised 3,786 command-and-control (C2) servers, 14,134 victim IP addresses tied to data stealer infections, 1,415 phishing links and domains, 939

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
While IT security managers in companies and public administrations rely on the concept of Zero Trust, APTS (Advanced Persistent Threats) are putting its practical effectiveness to the test. Analysts, on the other hand, understand that Zero Trust can only be achieved with comprehensive insight into one's own network.&nbsp; Just recently, an attack believed to be perpetrated by the Chinese hacker group&nbsp; Storm-0558 &nbsp;targeted several government agencies. They used fake digital authentication tokens to access webmail accounts running on Microsoft's Outlook service. In this incident, the attackers stole a signing key from Microsoft, enabling them to issue functional access tokens for Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Outlook.com and to download emails and attachments. Due to a plausibility check error, the digital signature, which was only intended for private customer accounts (MSA), also worked in the Azure Active Directory for business customers.&nbsp; Embracing the Zero Trust Revolution Acc

Microsoft on Thursday disclosed that it found a new version of the&nbsp; BlackCat &nbsp;ransomware (aka ALPHV and Noberus) that embeds tools like Impacket and RemCom to facilitate lateral movement and remote code execution. "The&nbsp; Impacket tool &nbsp;has credential dumping and remote service execution modules that could be used for broad deployment of the BlackCat ransomware in target environments," the company's threat intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). "This BlackCat version also has the&nbsp; RemCom hacktool &nbsp;embedded in the executable for remote code execution. The file also contains hardcoded compromised target credentials that actors use for lateral movement and further ransomware deployment." RemCom, billed as an open-source alternative to PsExec, has been put to use by Chinese and Iranian nation-state threat actors like&nbsp; Dalbit &nbsp;and&nbsp; Chafer &nbsp;(aka Remix Kitten) to move across the victim environments in the past.

Google has announced plans to add a new feature in the upcoming version of its Chrome web browser to alert users when an extension they have installed has been removed from the Chrome Web Store. The feature, set for release alongside Chrome 117, allows users to be notified when an add-on has been unpublished by a developer, taken down for violating Chrome Web Store policy, or marked as malware. The tech giant said it intends to highlight such extensions under a "Safety check" category in the "Privacy and security" section of the browser settings page. "When a user clicks 'Review,' they will be taken to their extensions and given the choice to either remove the extension or hide the warning if they wish to keep the extension installed," Oliver Dunk, a developer relations engineer for Chrome extensions,&nbsp; said .

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undetected attack method called&nbsp; NoFilter &nbsp;has been found to abuse the Windows Filtering Platform ( WFP ) to achieve privilege escalation in the Windows operating system. "If an attacker has the ability to execute code with admin privilege and the target is to perform&nbsp; LSASS Shtinkering , these privileges are not enough," Ron Ben Yizhak, a security researcher at Deep Instinct, told The Hacker News. "Running as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" is required. The techniques described in this research can escalate from admin to SYSTEM." The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;were presented at the DEF CON security conference over the weekend. The starting point of the&nbsp; research &nbsp;is an in-house tool called RPC Mapper the cybersecurity company used to map remote procedure call ( RPC ) methods, specifically those that invoke&nbsp; WinAPI , leading to the discovery of a method named "BfeRpcOpenToken," which is part of WFP.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing cyber attack campaign originating from China is targeting the Southeast Asian gambling sector to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons on compromised systems.&nbsp; Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne said the tactics, techniques, and procedures point to the involvement of a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; Bronze Starlight &nbsp;(aka Emperor Dragonfly or Storm-0401), which has been linked to the use of&nbsp; short-lived &nbsp; ransomware families &nbsp;as a smokescreen to conceal its espionage motives. "The threat actors abuse Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Edge, and McAfee VirusScan executables vulnerable to DLL hijacking to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons," security researchers Aleksandar Milenkoski and Tom Hegel&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published today. It also bears noting that the campaign exhibits overlaps with an intrusion set monitored by ESET under the name&nbsp; Operation ChattyGoblin . This activity, in turn, shares commonalities with a&nbsp; supply chain attack &nbsp;that came to light last year leveraging a troja

New Apple iOS 16 Exploit Enables Stealthy Cellular Access Under Fake Airplane Mode<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-apple-ios-16-exploit-enables.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have documented a novel post-exploit persistence technique on iOS 16 that could be abused to fly under the radar and maintain access to an Apple device even when the victim believes it is offline. The method "tricks the victim into thinking their device's Airplane Mode works when in reality the attacker (following successful device exploit) has planted an artificial Airplane Mode which edits the UI to display Airplane Mode icon and cuts internet connection to all apps except the attacker application," Jamf Threat Labs researchers Hu Ke and Nir Avraham said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Airplane Mode , as the name implies, allows users to turn off wireless features in their devices, effectively preventing them from connecting to Wi-Fi networks, cellular data, and Bluetooth as well as sending or receiving calls and text messages. The approach devised by Jamf, in a nutshell, provides an illusion to the user that the Airplane Mode is

New LABRAT Campaign Exploits GitLab Flaw for Cryptojacking and Proxyjacking Activities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-labrat-campaign-exploits-gitlab.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new, financially motivated operation dubbed&nbsp; LABRAT &nbsp;has been observed weaponizing a now-patched critical flaw in GitLab as part of a cryptojacking and proxyjacking campaign. "The attacker utilized undetected signature-based tools, sophisticated and stealthy cross-platform malware, command-and-control (C2) tools which bypassed firewalls, and kernel-based rootkits to hide their presence," Sysdig&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Furthermore, the attacker abused a legitimate service,&nbsp; TryCloudflare , to obfuscate their C2 network." Proxyjacking &nbsp;allows the attacker to rent the compromised host out to a proxy network, making it possible to monetize the unused bandwidth. Cryptojacking, on the other hand, refers to the abuse of the system resources to mine cryptocurrency. A notable aspect of the campaign is the use of compiled binaries written in Go and .NET to fly under the radar, with LABRAT also providing backdoor access to the infected systems.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hitherto undocumented threat actor operating for nearly a decade and codenamed&nbsp; MoustachedBouncer has been attributed to cyber espionage attacks aimed at foreign embassies in Belarus. "Since 2020, MoustachedBouncer has most likely been able to perform adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks at the ISP level, within Belarus, in order to compromise its targets," ESET security researcher Matthieu Faou&nbsp; said , describing the group as skilled and advanced. The adversary, active since at least 2014, is assessed to be aligned with Belarusian interests, likely employing a lawful interception system such as&nbsp; SORM &nbsp;to conduct its AitM attacks as well as deploy disparate tools called NightClub and Disco. Both the Windows malware frameworks support additional spying plugins including a screenshotter, an audio recorder, and a file stealer. The oldest sample of NightClub dates back to November 19, 2014, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal from Ukraine. Embassy staff from four differ

Google has announced plans to add support for quantum-resistant encryption algorithms in its Chrome browser, starting with version 116. "Chrome will begin supporting&nbsp; X25519Kyber768 &nbsp;for establishing symmetric secrets in&nbsp; TLS , starting in Chrome 116, and available behind a flag in Chrome 115," Devon O'Brien&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post published Thursday.

The encryption algorithm has already been adopted by&nbsp; Cloudflare ,&nbsp; Amazon Web Services , and IBM. X25519Kyber768 is a hybrid algorithm that combines the output of&nbsp; X25519 , an elliptic curve algorithm widely used for key agreement in TLS, and Kyber-768 to create a strong session key to encrypt TLS connections.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Chinese threat actor known as APT31 (aka Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, or Violet Typhoon) has been linked to a set of advanced backdoors that are capable of exfiltrating harvested sensitive information to Dropbox. The malware is part of a broader collection of&nbsp; more than 15 implants &nbsp;that have been put to use by the adversary in attacks targeting industrial organizations in Eastern Europe in 2022. "The attackers aimed to establish a permanent channel for data exfiltration, including data stored on air-gapped systems," Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis spotlighting APT31's previously undocumented tradecraft. The intrusions employ a three-stage malware stack, each focused on disparate aspects of the attack chain: setting up persistence, gathering sensitive data, and transmitting the information to a remote server under the threat actor's control. Some variants of the second-stage backdoors also come with features designed to look up file names in the Microso

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been linked to a cyber attack on a power generation company in southern Africa with a new variant of the SystemBC malware called DroxiDat as a precursor to a suspected ransomware attack. "The proxy-capable backdoor was deployed alongside Cobalt Strike Beacons in a south African nation's critical infrastructure," Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT),&nbsp; said . The Russian cybersecurity company said the attack, which took place in late March 2023, was in its early stages and involved the use of DroxiDat to profile the system and proxy network traffic using the&nbsp; SOCKS5 protocol &nbsp;to and from command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. SystemBC &nbsp;is a C/C++-based commodity malware and remote administrative tool that was&nbsp; first seen in 2019 .

It was&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;by Microsoft as part of its August 2023 Patch Tuesday updates shipped earlier this week, tagging it with an "Exploitation More Likely" assessment. While exact details surrounding the nature of exploitation are unclear, the Windows maker has acknowledged the existence of a proof-of-concept (PoC) in its advisory. It also said that attacks leveraging the flaw can be pulled off without any additional privileges or user interaction.

Malicious actors are using a legitimate Rust-based injector called&nbsp; Freeze[.]rs &nbsp;to deploy a commodity malware called XWorm in victim environments. The novel attack chain, detected by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs on July 13, 2023, is initiated via a phishing email containing a booby-trapped PDF file. It has also been used to introduce Remcos RAT by means of a crypter called SYK Crypter, which was first documented by Morphisec in May 2022. "This file redirects to an HTML file and utilizes the 'search-ms' protocol to access an LNK file on a remote server," security researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . "Upon clicking the LNK file, a PowerShell script executes Freeze[.]rs and SYK Crypter for further offensive actions." Freeze[.]rs, released on May 4, 2023, is a&nbsp; open-source red teaming tool &nbsp;from Optiv that functions as a payload creation tool used for circumventing security solutions and executing shellcode in a stealthy manner. "Freeze[.]rs&nbsp;utilizes multiple tec

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new information malware strain called&nbsp; Statc Stealer &nbsp;has been found infecting devices running Microsoft Windows to siphon sensitive personal and payment information. "Statc Stealer exhibits a broad range of stealing capabilities, making it a significant threat," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Shivam Sharma and Amandeep Kumar&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published this week. "It can steal sensitive information from various web browsers, including login data, cookies, web data, and preferences. Additionally, it targets cryptocurrency wallets, credentials, passwords, and even data from messaging apps like Telegram." Written in C++, the malicious stealer finds its way into victim systems when potential victims are tricked into clicking on seemingly innocuous ads, with the stealer imitating an MP4 video file format on web browsers like Google Chrome. The first-stage payload, while dropping and executing a decoy PDF installer, also stealthily deploys a downloader

Attackers continue to target Microsoft identities to gain access to connected Microsoft applications and federated SaaS applications. Additionally, attackers continue to progress their attacks in these environments, not by exploiting vulnerabilities, but by abusing native Microsoft functionality to achieve their objective. The attacker group Nobelium, linked with the SolarWinds attacks, has been documented using native functionality like the creation of Federated Trusts&nbsp; [1] &nbsp;to enable persistent access to a Microsoft tenant. This article demonstrates an additional native functionality that when leveraged by an attacker enables persistent access to a Microsoft cloud tenant and lateral movement capabilities to another tenant. This attack vector enables an attacker operating in a compromised tenant to abuse a misconfigured Cross-Tenant Synchronization (CTS) configuration and gain access to other connected tenants or deploy a rogue CTS configuration to maintain persistence within the te

A widely used Chinese language input app for Windows and Android has been found vulnerable to serious security flaws that could allow a malicious interloper to decipher the text typed by users. The findings from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which carried out an analysis of the encryption mechanism used in Tencent's Sogou Input Method , an app that has over 455 million monthly active users across Windows, Android, and iOS. The vulnerabilities are rooted in EncryptWall, the service's custom encryption system, allowing network eavesdroppers to extract the textual content and access sensitive data. "The Windows and Android versions of Sogou Input Method contain vulnerabilities in this encryption system, including a vulnerability to a CBC&nbsp; padding oracle attack , which allow network eavesdroppers to recover the plaintext of encrypted network transmissions, revealing sensitive information including what users have typed," the researchers&nbsp; said .

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are increasingly using a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit dubbed EvilProxy to pull off account takeover attacks aimed at high-ranking executives at prominent companies. According to Proofpoint, an ongoing hybrid campaign has leveraged the service to target thousands of Microsoft 365 user accounts, sending approximately 120,000 phishing emails to hundreds of organizations worldwide between March and June 2023. Nearly 39% of the hundreds of compromised users are said to be C-level executives, including CEOs (9%) and CFOs (17%). The attacks have also singled out personnel with access to financial assets or sensitive information. At least 35% of all compromised users had additional account protections enabled. The campaigns are seen as a response to the increased adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in enterprises, prompting threat actors to evolve their tactics to bypass new security layers by incorporating adversary-in-the-middle ( AitM ) phishing kits to

Interpol has announced the takedown of a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform called 16Shop, in addition to the arrests of three individuals in Indonesia and Japan. 16Shop specialized in the sales of phishing kits that other cybercriminals can purchase to mount phishing attacks on a large scale, ultimately facilitating the theft of credentials and payment details from users of popular services such as Apple, PayPal, American Express, Amazon, and Cash App, among others. "Victims typically receive an email with a pdf file or link that redirects to a site requesting the victims' credit card or other personally identifiable information," Interpol&nbsp; said . "This information is then stolen and used to extract money from the victims." No less than 70,000 users across 43 countries are estimated to have been compromised via services offered on 16Shop.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Validate security continuously across your full stack with Pen Testing as a Service. In today's modern security operations center (SOC), it's a battle between the defenders and the cybercriminals. Both are using tools and expertise – however, the cybercriminals have the element of surprise on their side, and a host of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that have evolved. These external threat actors have now been further emboldened in the era of AI with open-source tools like ChatGPT. With the potential of an attack leading to a breach within minutes, CISOs now are looking to prepare all systems and assets for cyber resilience and rapid response when needed. With tools and capabilities to validate security continuously – including penetration testing as a service – DevSecOps teams can remediate critical vulnerabilities fast due to the easy access to tactical support to the teams that need it the most. This gives the SOC and DevOps teams tools to that remove false po

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has introduced a new security feature in Android 14 that allows IT administrators to disable support for 2G cellular networks in their managed device fleet. The search giant said it's introducing a second user setting to turn off support, at the model level, for&nbsp; null-ciphered cellular connections . "The Android Security Model assumes that all networks are hostile to keep users safe from network packet injection, tampering, or eavesdropping on user traffic," Roger Piqueras Jover, Yomna Nasser, and Sudhi Herle&nbsp; said . "Android does not rely on link-layer encryption to address this threat model. Instead, Android establishes that all network traffic should be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)." 2G networks, in particular, employ weak encryption and lack mutual authentication,&nbsp; rendering &nbsp;them&nbsp; susceptible &nbsp;to over-the-air interception and traffic decryption attacks by impersonating a real 2G tower.

The U.K. Electoral Commission on Tuesday disclosed a "complex" cyber attack on its systems that went undetected for over a year, allowing the threat actors to access years worth of voter data belonging to 40 million people. "The incident was identified in October 2022 after suspicious activity was detected on our systems," the regulator&nbsp; said . "It became clear that hostile actors had first accessed the systems in August 2021." The intrusion enabled unauthorized access to the Commission's servers hosting email, control systems, and copies of the electoral registers it maintains for research purposes. The identity of the intruders are presently unknown. The registers included the name and address of anyone in the U.K. who registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, as well as the names of those registered as overseas voters. However, they did not contain information of those who qualified to register anonymously and addresses of overseas electors regi

Exposed Kubernetes (K8s) clusters are being exploited by malicious actors to deploy cryptocurrency miners and other backdoors. Cloud security firm Aqua, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News, said a majority of the clusters belonged to small to medium-sized organizations, with a smaller subset tied to bigger companies, spanning financial, aerospace, automotive, industrial, and security sectors. In total, Kubernetes clusters belonging to more than 350 organizations, open-source projects, and individuals were discovered, 60% of which were the target of an active crypto-mining campaign. The publicly-accessible clusters, per Aqua, are said to suffer from two different kinds of misconfigurations: allowing anonymous access with high privileges and running kubectl proxy with the flags "--address=`0.0.0.0` --accept-hosts `.*`" "Housing a wide array of sensitive and valuable assets, Kubernetes clusters can store customer data, financial records, intellectual property, a

Tactical similarities have been unearthed between the double extortion ransomware group known as Rhysida and Vice Society , including in their targeting of education and healthcare sectors. "As Vice Society was observed deploying a variety of commodity ransomware payloads, this link does not suggest that Rhysida is exclusively used by Vice Society, but shows with at least medium confidence that Vice Society operators are now using Rhysida ransomware," Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. Vice Society , tracked by Microsoft under the name Storm-0832, has a&nbsp; pattern &nbsp;of employing already existing ransomware binaries that are sold on criminal forums to pull off their attacks. The financially motivated gang has also been observed resorting to pure extortion-themed attacks wherein the data is exfiltrated without encrypting them.

The operators associated with the QakBot (aka QBot) malware have set up 15 new command-and-control (C2) servers as of late June 2023. The findings are a continuation of the malware's infrastructure analysis from Team Cymru, and arrive a little over two months after Lumen Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that 25% of its C2 servers are only active for a single day. "QakBot has a history of taking an extended break each summer before returning sometime in September, with this year's spamming activities ceasing around 22 June 2023," the cybersecurity firm&nbsp; said . "But are the QakBot operators actually on vacation when they aren't spamming, or is this 'break' a time for them to refine and update their infrastructure and tools?" QakBot's C2 network, like in the case of Emotet and IcedID, is&nbsp; characterized &nbsp;by a tiered architecture in which C2 nodes communicate with upstream Tier 2 (T2) C2 nodes hosted on VPS providers geolocated in Russia.

Hackers Abusing Cloudflare Tunnels for Covert Communications<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/hackers-abusing-cloudflare-tunnels-for.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has revealed that threat actors are abusing Cloudflare Tunnels to establish covert communication channels from compromised hosts and retain persistent access. "Cloudflared is functionally very similar to ngrok," Nic Finn, a senior threat intelligence analyst at GuidePoint Security, said . "However, Cloudflared differs from ngrok in that it provides a lot more usability for free, including the ability to host TCP connectivity over cloudflared." A command-line tool for Cloudflare Tunnel, cloudflared allows users to create secure connections between an origin web server and Cloudflare's nearest data center so as to hide the web server IP addresses as well as block volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and brute-force login attacks. For a threat actor with elevated access on an infected host, this feature presents a lucrative approach to set up a foothold by generating a token required to establish the tunnel from the victim machine.

Introduced in 1999, Microsoft Active Directory is the default identity and access management service in Windows networks, responsible for assigning and enforcing security policies for all network endpoints. With it, users can access various resources across networks. As things tend to do, times, they are a'changin' – and a few years back, Microsoft introduced Azure Active Directory, the cloud-based version of AD to extend the AD paradigm, providing organizations with an Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solution across both the cloud and on-prem apps. (Note that as of July 11th 2023, this service was renamed to&nbsp; Microsoft Entra ID , but for the sake of simplicity, we'll refer to it as Azure AD in this post) Both Active Directory and Azure AD are critical to the functioning of on-prem, cloud-based, and hybrid ecosystems, playing a key role in uptime and business continuity.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor is using a variant of the Yashma ransomware to target various entities in English-speaking countries, Bulgaria, China, and Vietnam at least since June 4, 2023. Cisco Talos, in a new write-up, attributed the operation with moderate confidence to an adversary of likely Vietnamese origin. "The threat actor uses an uncommon technique to deliver the ransom note," security researcher Chetan Raghuprasad&nbsp; said . "Instead of embedding the ransom note strings in the binary, they download the ransom note from the actor-controlled GitHub repository by executing an embedded batch file." Yashma,&nbsp; first described &nbsp;by the BlackBerry research and intelligence team in May 2022, is a rebranded version of another ransomware strain called Chaos. A month prior to its emergence, the Chaos ransomware builder was leaked in the wild. A notable aspect of the ransom note is its resemblance to the well-known WannaCry ransomware, possibly done so in an attempt to obs

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a set of 11 living-off-the-land binaries-and-scripts ( LOLBAS ) that could be maliciously abused by threat actors to conduct post-exploitation activities.&nbsp; "LOLBAS is an attack method that uses binaries and scripts that are already part of the system for malicious purposes," Pentera security researcher Nir Chako&nbsp; said . "This makes it hard for security teams to distinguish between legitimate and malicious activities, since they are all performed by trusted system utilities." To that end, the Israeli cybersecurity company said it uncovered nine LOLBAS downloaders and three executors that could enable adversaries to download and execute "more robust malware" on infected hosts. This includes: MsoHtmEd.exe, Mspub.exe, ProtocolHandler.exe, ConfigSecurityPolicy.exe, InstallUtil.exe, Mshta.exe, Presentationhost.exe, Outlook.exe, MSAccess.exe, scp.exe, and sftp.exe.&nbsp; "In a complete attack chain, a hacker will us

A new malware campaign has been observed making use of malicious OpenBullet configuration files to target inexperienced cyber criminals with the goal of delivering a remote access trojan (RAT) capable of stealing sensitive information. Bot mitigation company Kasada&nbsp; said &nbsp;the activity is designed to "exploit trusted criminal networks," describing it as an instance of advanced threat actors "preying on beginner hackers." OpenBullet &nbsp;is a legitimate&nbsp; open-source pen testing tool &nbsp;used for automating credential stuffing attacks. It takes in a&nbsp; configuration file &nbsp;that's tailored to a specific website and can combine it with a password list procured through other means to log successful attempts. "OpenBullet can be used with Puppeteer, which is a headless browser that can be used for automating web interactions," the company&nbsp; said .

In today's interconnected world, evolving security solutions to meet growing demand is more critical than ever. Collaboration across multiple solutions for intelligence gathering and information sharing is indispensable. The idea of multiple-source intelligence gathering stems from the concept that threats are rarely isolated. Hence, their detection and prevention require a comprehensive understanding of the broader landscape. A comprehensive and robust security framework should be established by aggregating resources, knowledge, and expertise from various sources. This collaborative effort allows for the analysis of diverse data sets, the identification of emerging patterns, and the timely dissemination of crucial information.&nbsp; In this article, we discuss a versatile security platform that can operate in two distinct roles within a security ecosystem.

A group of academics has devised a "deep learning-based acoustic side-channel attack" that can be used to classify laptop keystrokes that are recorded using a nearby phone with 95% accuracy. "When trained on keystrokes recorded using the video conferencing software Zoom, an accuracy of 93% was achieved, a new best for the medium," researchers Joshua Harrison, Ehsan Toreini, and Maryam Mehrnezhad&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new study published last week. Side-channel attacks&nbsp; refer &nbsp;to a class of&nbsp; security exploits &nbsp;that aim to glean insights from a system by monitoring and measuring its physical effects during the processing of sensitive data. Some of the common observable effects include runtime behavior, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, acoustics, and cache accesses.

New SkidMap Linux Malware Variant Targeting Vulnerable Redis Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-skidmap-redis-malware-variant.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Vulnerable&nbsp; Redis services &nbsp;have been targeted by a "new, improved, dangerous" variant of a malware called SkidMap that's engineered to target a wide range of Linux distributions. "The malicious nature of this malware is to adapt to the system on which it is executed," Trustwave security researcher Radoslaw Zdonczyk&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. Some of the Linux distribution SkidMap sets its eyes on include Alibaba, Anolis, openEuler, EulerOS, Stream, CentOS, RedHat, and Rocky. SkidMap was&nbsp; first disclosed &nbsp;by Trend Micro in September 2019 as a cryptocurrency mining botnet with capabilities to load malicious kernel modules that can obfuscate its activities as well as monitor the miner process. The operators of the malware have also been found camouflaging their backup command-and-control (C2) IP address on the Bitcoin blockchain, evocative of another botnet malware known as&nbsp; Glupteba .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning about cyber crooks masquerading as legitimate non-fungible token (NFT) developers to steal cryptocurrency and other digital assets from unsuspecting users. In these fraudulent schemes, criminals either obtain direct access to NFT developer social media accounts or create look-alike accounts to promote "exclusive" new NFT releases, often employing misleading advertising campaigns that create a sense of urgency to pull them off. "Links provided in these announcements are phishing links directing victims to a spoofed website that appears to be a legitimate extension of a particular NFT project," the FBI&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory last week. The replica websites urge potential targets to connect their cryptocurrency wallets and purchase the NFT, only for the threat actors to siphon the funds and NFTs to wallets under their control. "Contents stolen from victims' wallets are often processed through a ser

Managed Detection and Response (MDR) has emerged as a crucial solution for organizations looking to bolster their security measures. MDR allows businesses to outsource the management of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) products deployed across their network domain. With real-time threat-hunting capabilities, MDR services detect and mitigate malicious activities on individual endpoints while promptly alerting the service provider's Security Operations Center (SOC) for further investigation. By leveraging the expertise of security specialists, MDR services relieve organizations of the complexities and criticality associated with security operations. Types of MDR Solutions: MDR services come in various forms, tailored to an organization's technology environment and risk requirements.&nbsp; These include: Bring-Your-Own Security Stack / Hybrid Solution: MDR solutions that integrate with existing security products deployed within an environment.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are using an open-source rootkit called&nbsp; Reptile &nbsp;to target Linux systems in South Korea. "Unlike other rootkit malware that typically only provide concealment capabilities, Reptile goes a step further by offering a reverse shell, allowing threat actors to easily take control of systems," the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. "Port knocking is a method where the malware opens a specific port on an infected system and goes on standby. When the threat actor sends a magic packet to the system, the received packet is used as a basis to establish a connection with the C&amp;C server." A rootkit is a malicious software program that's designed to provide privileged, root-level access to a machine while concealing its presence. At least four different campaigns have leveraged Reptile since 2022. The first use of the rootkit was&nbsp; recorded &nbsp;by Trend Micro in May 2022 in connection with an intrusion

Microsoft on Friday disclosed that it has addressed a critical security flaw impacting Power Platform , but not before it came under criticism for its failure to swiftly act on it. "The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to Custom Code functions used for Power Platform custom connectors," the tech giant&nbsp; said . "The potential impact could be unintended information disclosure if secrets or other sensitive information were embedded in the Custom Code function." The company further noted that no customer action is required and that it found no evidence of active exploitation of the vulnerability in the wild. Tenable, which initially discovered and reported the shortcoming to Redmond on March 30, 2023,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the problem could enable limited, unauthorized access to cross-tenant applications and sensitive data.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new high-severity security flaw in PaperCut print management software for Windows that could result in remote code execution under specific circumstances. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-39143 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.4), the flaw impacts PaperCut NG/MF prior to version 22.1.3. It has been described as a combination of a path traversal and file upload vulnerability. "CVE-2023-39143 enables unauthenticated attackers to potentially read, delete, and upload arbitrary files to the PaperCut MF/NG application server, resulting in remote code execution in certain configurations," Horizon3.ai's Naveen Sunkavally&nbsp; said . The cybersecurity firm said that file upload leading to remote code execution is possible when the external device integration setting is enabled, which is on by default in some installations of PaperCut. Earlier this April, another remote code execution vulnerability in the same product (CVE-2023-27350, CVSS score: 9.8) and an infor

A married couple from New York City has pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in connection with the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency stock exchange Bitfinex, resulting in the theft of about 120,000 bitcoin. The development comes more than a year after Ilya Lichtenstein, 35, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 33, were&nbsp; arrested in February 2022 , following the seizure of roughly 95,000 of the stolen crypto assets that were held by the defendants. The funds were valued at $3.6 billion at the time. Since then, the U.S. government said it has since seized another approximately $475 million tied to the breach. "Lichtenstein used a number of advanced hacking tools and techniques to gain access to Bitfinex's network," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)&nbsp; said . "Once inside their systems, Lichtenstein fraudulently authorized more than 2,000 transactions in which 119,754 bitcoin was transferred from Bitfinex to a cryptocurrency wallet in Lichtenstein's control."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new bunch of malicious packages on the npm package registry that are designed to exfiltrate sensitive developer information. Software supply chain firm Phylum, which first identified the "test" packages on July 31, 2023, said they "demonstrated increasing functionality and refinement," hours after which they were removed and re-uploaded under different, legitimate-sounding package names. While the end goal of the undertaking is not clear, it's suspected to be a highly targeted campaign&nbsp; aimed at the cryptocurrency sector &nbsp;based on references to modules such as "rocketrefer" and "binarium." All the packages were published by the npm user malikrukd4732. A common feature across all the modules is the ability to launch JavaScript ("index.js") that's equipped to exfiltrate valuable information to a remote server. "The index.js code is spawned in a child process by the preinstall.j

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A four-year-old critical security flaw impacting Fortinet FortiOS SSL has emerged as one of the most routinely and frequently exploited vulnerabilities in 2022. "In 2022, malicious cyber actors exploited older software vulnerabilities more frequently than recently disclosed vulnerabilities and targeted unpatched, internet-facing systems," cybersecurity and intelligence agencies from the Five Eyes nations, which comprises Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S.,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a joint alert. The continued weaponization of&nbsp; CVE-2018-13379 , which was also one among the most exploited bugs in&nbsp; 2020 &nbsp;and&nbsp; 2021 , suggests a failure on the part of organizations to apply patches in a timely manner, the authorities said. "Malicious cyber actors likely prioritize developing exploits for severe and globally prevalent CVEs," according to the advisory.

Threat actors are leveraging a technique called versioning to evade Google Play Store's malware detections and target Android users. "Campaigns using versioning commonly target users' credentials, data, and finances," Google Cybersecurity Action Team (GCAT)&nbsp; s aid &nbsp;in its August 2023 Threat Horizons Report shared with The Hacker News. While versioning is not a new phenomenon, it's sneaky and hard to detect. In this method, a developer releases an initial version of an app on the Play Store that passes Google's pre-publication checks, but is later updated with a malware component. This is achieved by pushing an update from an attacker-controlled server to serve malicious code on the end user device using a method called dynamic code loading (DCL), effectively turning the app into a backdoor. Earlier this May, ESET&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;a screen recording app named "iRecorder - Screen Recorder" that remained innocuous for nearly a year after it was first

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new version of malware called&nbsp; Rilide &nbsp;that targets Chromium-based web browsers to steal sensitive data and steal cryptocurrency.

Rilide was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by the cybersecurity company in April 2023, uncovering two different attack chains that made use of Ekipa RAT and Aurora Stealer to deploy rogue browser extensions capable of data and crypto theft. It's sold on dark web forums by an actor named "friezer" for $5,000.

The frequency and complexity of cyber threats are constantly evolving. At the same time, organizations are now collecting sensitive data that, if compromised, could result in severe financial and reputational damage.&nbsp; According to Cybersecurity Ventures , the cost of cybercrime is predicted to hit $8 trillion in 2023 and will grow to $10.5 trillion by 2025. There is also increasing public and regulatory scrutiny over data protection. Compliance regulations (such as PCI DSS and ISO 27001), as well as the need for a better understanding of your cybersecurity risks, are driving the need to conduct regular penetration tests.&nbsp; Pen testing helps to identify security flaws in your IT infrastructure before threat actors can detect and exploit them. This gives you visibility into the risks posed by potential attacks and enables you to take swift corrective action to address them. Here, we outline key factors to consider before, during, and post the penetration testing process. Pre-Penetrati

"Sports teams, major league and global sporting associations, and entertainment venues house a trove of valuable information desirable to cybercriminals." "Unfortunately, this information can be vulnerable at-scale, due to the number of connected devices and interconnected networks in these environments." The company specifically singled out hospitals delivering critical support and health services for fans and players as being targets of ransomware attacks, resulting in service disruptions. To defend against such attacks, Microsoft is recommending that - Companies disable unnecessary ports a

A hacktivist group known as&nbsp; Mysterious Team Bangladesh &nbsp;has been linked to over 750 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and 78 website defacements since June 2022. "The group most frequently attacks logistics, government, and financial sector organizations in India and Israel," Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity firm Group-IB said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The group is primarily driven by religious and political motives." Some of the other targeted countries include Australia, Senegal, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Ethiopia. In addition, the threat actor is said to have gained access to web servers and administrative panels, likely by exploiting known security flaws or poorly-secured passwords. Mysterious Team Bangladesh, as the name indicates, is suspected to be of Bangladeshi origin. "We are working to protect Our Bangladesh Cyberspace," the group's Intro on Facebook&nbsp; reads .

Microsoft on Wednesday disclosed that it identified a set of highly targeted social engineering attacks mounted by a Russian nation-state threat actor using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats. The tech giant attributed the attacks to a group it tracks as&nbsp; Midnight Blizzard &nbsp;(previously Nobelium). It's also called APT29, BlueBravo, Cozy Bear, Iron Hemlock, and The Dukes. "In this latest activity, the threat actor uses previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities," the company&nbsp; said . "Using these domains from compromised tenants, Midnight Blizzard leverages Teams messages to send lures that attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and eliciting approval of multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts."

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a bypass for a recently fixed actively exploited vulnerability in some versions of Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), prompting Ivanti to urge users to update to the latest version of the software. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-35082 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 10.0) and discovered by Rapid7, the issue "allows unauthenticated attackers to access the API in older unsupported versions of MobileIron Core (11.2 and below)." "If exploited, this vulnerability enables an unauthorized, remote (internet-facing) actor to potentially access users' personally identifiable information and make limited changes to the server," Ivanti&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory released on August 2, 2023. Rapid7 security researcher Stephen Fewer&nbsp; said , "CVE-2023-35082 arises from the same place as CVE-2023-35078, specifically the permissive nature of certain entries in the mifs web application's security filter chain."

A Russia-nexus adversary has been linked to 94 new domains starting March 2023, suggesting that the group is actively modifying its infrastructure in response to public disclosures about its activities. Cybersecurity firm Recorded Future&nbsp;linked the revamped infrastructure to a threat actor it tracks under the name&nbsp; BlueCharlie , a hacking crew that's broadly known by the names Blue Callisto, Callisto (or Calisto), COLDRIVER, Star Blizzard (formerly SEABORGIUM), and TA446. BlueCharlie was previously given the temporary designation Threat Activity Group 53 (TAG-53). "These shifts demonstrate that these threat actors are aware of industry reporting and show a certain level of sophistication in their efforts to obfuscate or modify their activity, aiming to stymie security researchers," the company said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. BlueCharlie is assessed to be affiliated with Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), with the threat actor linked

A sophisticated Facebook phishing campaign has been observed exploiting a zero-day flaw in Salesforce's email services, allowing threat actors to craft targeted phishing messages using the company's domain and infrastructure. "Those phishing campaigns cleverly evade conventional detection methods by chaining the Salesforce vulnerability and legacy quirks in Facebook's Web Games platform," Guardio Labs researchers Oleg Zaytsev and Nati Tal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The email messages masquerade as coming from Meta, while being sent from an email address with a "@salesforce.com" domain. They seek to trick recipients into clicking on a link by claiming that their Facebook accounts are undergoing a "comprehensive investigation" due to "suspicions of engaging in impersonation." The goal is to direct users to a rogue landing page that's designed to capture the victim's account credentials and two-factor aut

Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploited a recently disclosed critical flaw impacting Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) as a zero-day since at least April 2023 in attacks directed against Norwegian entities, including a government network. The disclosure comes as part of a new joint advisory released by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Norwegian National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NO) Tuesday. The exact identity or origin of the threat actor remains unclear. "The APT actors have exploited CVE-2023-35078 since at least April 2023," the authorities&nbsp; said . "The actors leveraged compromised small office/home office (SOHO) routers, including ASUS routers, to proxy to target infrastructure.' CVE-2023-35078 refers to a&nbsp; severe flaw &nbsp;that allows threat actors to access personally identifiable information (PII) and gain the ability to make configuration changes on compromised systems.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a Python variant of a stealer malware&nbsp; NodeStealer &nbsp;that's equipped to fully take over Facebook business accounts as well as siphon cryptocurrency. Palo Alto Network Unit 42 said it detected the previously undocumented strain as part of a campaign that commenced in December 2022. NodeStealer was&nbsp; first exposed &nbsp;by Meta in May 2023, describing it as a stealer capable of harvesting cookies and passwords from web browsers to compromise Facebook, Gmail, and Outlook accounts. While the prior samples were written in JavaScript, the latest versions are coded in Python. "NodeStealer poses great risk for both individuals and organizations," Unit 42 researcher Lior Rochberger&nbsp; said . "Besides the direct impact on Facebook business accounts, which is mainly financial, the malware also steals credentials from browsers, which can be used for further attacks." The attacks start with bogus messages on Facebook that purportedly clai

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Various European customers of different banks are being targeted by an Android banking trojan called&nbsp; SpyNote &nbsp;as part of an aggressive campaign detected in June and July 2023. "The spyware is distributed through email phishing or smishing campaigns and the fraudulent activities are executed with a combination of remote access trojan (RAT) capabilities and vishing attack," Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical analysis released Monday. SpyNote , also called SpyMax, is similar to other Android banking Trojans in that it requires&nbsp; Android's accessibility permissions &nbsp;in order to grant itself other necessary permissions and gather sensitive data from infected devices. What makes the malware strain notable is its dual functions as spyware and perform bank fraud.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Data Security Posture Management is an approach to securing cloud data by ensuring that sensitive data always has the correct security posture - regardless of where it's been duplicated or moved to. So, what is DSPM? Here's a quick example: Let's say you've built an excellent&nbsp; security posture &nbsp;for your cloud data. For the sake of this example, your data is in production, it's protected behind a firewall, it's not publicly accessible, and your IAM controls have limited access properly. Now along comes a developer and replicates that data into a lower environment. What happens to that fine security posture you've built?&nbsp; Well, it's gone - and now the data is only protected by the security posture in that lower environment. So if that environment is exposed or improperly secured - so is all that sensitive data you've been trying to protect. Security postures just don't travel with their data .

A nation-state actor with links to China is suspected of being behind a series of attacks against industrial organizations in Eastern Europe that took place last year to siphon data stored on air-gapped systems. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky attributed the intrusions with medium to high confidence to a hacking crew called&nbsp; APT31 , which is also tracked under the monikers Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, and Violet Typhoon (formerly Zirconium), citing commonalities in the tactics observed. The attacks entailed the use of more than 15 distinct implants and their variants, broken down into three broad categories based on their ability to establish persistent remote access, gather sensitive information, and transmit the collected data to actor-controlled infrastructure. "One of the implant types appeared to be a sophisticated modular malware, aimed at profiling removable drives and contaminating them with a worm to exfiltrate data from isolated, or air-gapped, networks of indus

Organizations in Italy are the target of a new phishing campaign that leverages a new strain of malware called&nbsp; WikiLoader &nbsp;with an ultimate aim to install a banking trojan, stealer, and spyware referred to as&nbsp; Ursnif &nbsp;(aka Gozi). "It is a sophisticated downloader with the objective of installing a second malware payload," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. "The malware uses multiple mechanisms to evade detection and was likely developed as a malware that can be rented out to select cybercriminal threat actors." WikiLoader is so named due to the malware making a request to Wikipedia and checking that the response has the string "The Free." The enterprise security firm said it first detected the malware in the wild on December 27, 2022, in connection with an intrusion set mounted by a threat actor it tracks as&nbsp; TA544 , which is also known as Bamboo Spider and Zeus Panda.

The P2PInfect peer-to-peer (P2) worm has been observed employing previously undocumented initial access methods to breach susceptible Redis servers and rope them into a botnet. "The malware compromises exposed instances of the Redis data store by exploiting the replication feature," Cado Security researchers Nate Bill and Matt Muir&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "A common attack pattern against Redis in cloud environments is to exploit this feature using a malicious instance to enable replication. This is achieved via connecting to an exposed Redis instance and issuing the SLAVEOF command."

Threat actors associated with the hacking crew known as Patchwork have been spotted targeting universities and research organizations in China as part of a recently observed campaign.

Patchwork , also known by the names Operation Hangover and Zinc Emerson, is suspected to be a threat group that operates on behalf of India. Active since at least December 2015, attack chains mounted by the outfit have a narrow focus and tend to single out Pakistan and China with custom implants such as BADNEWS via spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. The adversarial collective has been found to share tactical overlaps with other cyber-espionage groups with an Indian connection, including&nbsp; SideWinder &nbsp;and the&nbsp; DoNot Team .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Demand for Virtual CISO services is soaring. According to Gartner, the use of vCISO services among small and mid-size businesses and non-regulated enterprises was expected to grow by a whopping 1900% in just one year, from only 1% in 2021 to 20% in 2022! Offering vCISO services can be especially attractive for MSPs and MSSPs. By addressing their customers' needs for proactive cyber resilience, they can generate a growing amount of recurring revenue from existing and new customers. And all while differentiating themselves from the competition. vCISO services also enable upselling of additional products and services the MSP or MSSP specializes in. However, not all MSPs and MSSPs fully understand how to provide vCISO services . Some may be unsure about which services are expected from them. Others may not realize they are already providing vCISO services and have the potential to effortlessly broaden their offerings into a complete vCISO suite or package it differently to make it more

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More details have emerged about a botnet called&nbsp; AVRecon , which has been observed making use of compromised small office/home office (SOHO) routers as part of a multi-year campaign active since at least May 2021. AVRecon was&nbsp; first disclosed &nbsp;by Lumen Black Lotus Labs earlier this month as malware capable of executing additional commands and stealing victim's bandwidth for what appears to be an illegal proxy service made available for other actors. It has also surpassed QakBot in terms of scale, having infiltrated over 41,000 nodes located across 20 countries worldwide. "The malware has been used to create residential proxy services to shroud malicious activity such as password spraying, web-traffic proxying, and ad fraud," the researchers said in the report. This has been corroborated by new findings from KrebsOnSecurity and Spur.us, which last week&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that "AVrecon is the malware engine behind a 12-year-old service called SocksEscort, which rents hacke

Threat actors are creating fake websites hosting trojanized software installers to trick unsuspecting users into downloading a downloader malware called Fruity with the goal of installing remote trojans tools like Remcos RAT. "Among the software in question are various instruments for fine-tuning CPUs, graphic cards, and BIOS; PC hardware-monitoring tools; and some other apps," cybersecurity vendor Doctor Web&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis.&nbsp; "Such installers are used as a decoy and contain not only the software potential victims are interested in, but also the trojan itself with all its components." The exact initial access vector used in the campaign is unclear but it could potentially range from phishing to drive-by downloads to malicious ads. Users who land on the fake site are prompted to download a ZIP installer package.

A new Android malware strain called&nbsp; CherryBlos &nbsp;has been observed making use of optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to gather sensitive data stored in pictures. CherryBlos, per&nbsp; Trend Micro , is distributed via bogus posts on social media platforms and comes with capabilities to steal cryptocurrency wallet-related credentials and act as a&nbsp; clipper &nbsp;to substitute wallet addresses when a victim copies a string matching a predefined format is copied to the clipboard. Once installed, the apps seek users' permissions to grant it accessibility permissions, which allows it to automatically grant itself additional permissions as required. As a defense evasion measure, users attempting to kill or uninstall the app by entering the Settings app are redirected back to the home screen. Besides displaying fake overlays on top of legitimate crypto wallet apps to steal credentials and make fraudulent fund transfers to an attacker-controlled address, CherryBlos utilizes OCR to recog

Apple has announced plans to require developers to submit reasons to use certain APIs in their apps starting later this year with the release of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS Sonoma, tvOS 17, and watchOS 10 to prevent their abuse for data collection. "This will help ensure that apps only use these APIs for their intended purpose," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement.

The APIs that&nbsp; require &nbsp;reasons for use relate to the following - File timestamp APIs System boot time APIs Disk space APIs Active keyboard APIs, and User defaults APIs The iPhone maker said it's making the move to ensure that such APIs are not abused by app developers to collect device signals to carry out&nbsp; fingerprinting , which could be employed to&nbsp; uniquely identify users &nbsp;across different a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday disclosed details of a "novel persistent backdoor" called&nbsp; SUBMARINE &nbsp;deployed by threat actors in connection with the hack on Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances. "SUBMARINE comprises multiple artifacts — including a SQL trigger, shell scripts, and a loaded library for a Linux daemon — that together enable execution with root privileges, persistence, command and control, and cleanup," the agency&nbsp; said . The findings come from an analysis of malware samples obtained from an unnamed organization that had been compromised by threat actors exploiting a critical flaw in ESG devices,&nbsp; CVE-2023-2868 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), which allows for remote command injection. Evidence gathered so far shows that the attackers behind the activity, a suspected China nexus-actor tracked by Mandiant as&nbsp; UNC4841 , leveraged the flaw as a zero-day in October 2022 to gain initial access to victim envir

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ivanti has disclosed yet another security flaw impacting Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron Core, that it said has been weaponized as part of an exploit chain by malicious actors in the wild. The new vulnerability, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-35081 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), impacts supported versions 11.10, 11.9, and 11.8, as well as those that are currently end-of-life (EoL). "CVE-2023-35081 enables an authenticated administrator to perform arbitrary file writes to the EPMM server," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "This vulnerability can be used in conjunction with&nbsp; CVE-2023-35078 , bypassing administrator authentication and ACLs restrictions (if applicable)." A successful exploit could allow a threat actor to write arbitrary files on the appliance, thereby enabling the malicious party to execute OS commands on the appliance as the tomcat user. "As of now we are only aware of the same limited number of customers impacted by CVE-2023-35078

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors linked to the malware loader known as IcedID have made updates to the BackConnect (BC) module that's used for post-compromise activity on hacked systems, new findings from Team Cymru reveal. IcedID, also called BokBot , is a strain of malware similar to&nbsp; Emotet &nbsp;and&nbsp; QakBot &nbsp;that started off as a banking trojan in 2017, before switching to the role of an initial access facilitator for other payloads. Recent versions of the malware have been&nbsp; observed &nbsp;removing functionality related to online banking fraud to prioritize ransomware delivery. The BackConnect (BC) module,&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Netresec in October 2022, relies on a proprietary command-and-control (C2) protocol to exchange commands between a server and the infected host. The protocol, which comes with a VNC component for remote access, has also been identified in other malware such as the now-discontinued&nbsp; BazarLoader &nbsp;and QakBot. In December 2022, Team Cymru&nbsp; reported &nbsp;the discovery of 11 BC C2s a

An ongoing cyber attack campaign has set its sights on Korean-speaking individuals by employing U.S. Military-themed document lures to trick them into running malware on compromised systems. Cybersecurity firm Securonix is tracking the activity under the name&nbsp; STARK#MULE . "Based on the source and likely targets, these types of attacks are on par with past attacks stemming from typical North Korean groups such as APT37 as South Korea has historically been a primary target of the group, especially its government officials," security researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov said in a report shared with The Hacker News. APT37, also known by the names Nickel Foxcroft, Reaper, Ricochet Chollima, and ScarCruft, is a&nbsp; North Korean nation-state actor &nbsp;that's known to exclusively focus on targets in its southern counterpart, specifically those involved in reporting on North Korea and supporting defectors.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As part of&nbsp; Checkmarx's mission &nbsp;to help organizations develop and deploy secure software, the Security Research team started looking at the security posture of major car manufacturers. Porsche has a well-established Vulnerability Reporting Policy (Disclosure Policy) [1] , it was considered in scope for our research, so we decided to start there, and see what we could find. What we found is an attack scenario that results from chaining security issues found on different Porsche's assets, a website and a GraphQL API, that could lead to data exfiltration. Data exfiltration is an attack technique that can impact businesses and organizations, regardless of size. When malicious users breach a company's or organization's systems and exfiltrate data, it can be a jarring and business-critical moment. Porsche has a diverse online presence - deploying several microsites, websites, and web applications. The Porsche Experience [2] is one website that allows registered users to

A legitimate Windows search feature is being exploited by malicious actors to download arbitrary payloads from remote servers and compromise targeted systems with remote access trojans such as AsyncRAT and Remcos RAT.

"Attackers are directing users to websites that exploit the 'search-ms' functionality using JavaScript hosted on the page," security researchers Mathanraj Thangaraju and Sijo Jacob&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday write-up.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Russian nation-state actor known as&nbsp; BlueBravo &nbsp;has been observed targeting diplomatic entities throughout Eastern Europe with the goal of delivering a new backdoor called GraphicalProton, exemplifying the continuous evolution of the threat. The phishing campaign is characterized by the use of legitimate internet services (LIS) for command-and-control (C2) obfuscation, Recorded Future said in a new report published Thursday. The activity was observed between March and May 2023. BlueBravo , also known by the names APT29, Cloaked Ursa, and Midnight Blizzard (formerly Nobelium), is attributed to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and has in the past&nbsp; used &nbsp;Dropbox, Firebase, Google Drive, Notion, and Trello to evade detection and stealthily establish communications with infected hosts. To that end, GraphicalProton is the latest addition to a long list of malware targeting diplomatic organizations after&nbsp; GraphicalNeutrino &nbsp;(aka SNOWYAMBER),&nbsp; HALFRIG, and QUARTERRIG .

Users of Metabase, a popular business intelligence and data visualization software package, are being advised to update to the latest version following the discovery of an "extremely severe" flaw that could result in pre-authenticated remote code execution on affected installations. Tracked as CVE-2023-38646 , the issue impacts open-source editions prior to 0.46.6.1 and Metabase Enterprise versions before 1.46.6.1. "An unauthenticated attacker can run arbitrary commands with the same privileges as the Metabase server on the server you are running Metabase on," Metabase said in an advisory released last week. The issue has also been addressed in the following older versions - 0.45.4.1 and 1.45.4.1 0.44.7.1 and 1.44.7.1, and 0.43.7.2 and 1.43.7.2 While there is no evidence that the issue has been exploited in the wild, data gathered by the Shadowserver Foundation shows that 5,488 out of the total 6,936 Metabase instances are vulnerable as of July 26, 202

Cybersecurity agencies in Australia and the U.S. have&nbsp; published &nbsp;a joint cybersecurity advisory warning against security flaws in web applications that could be exploited by malicious actors to orchestrate data breach incidents and steal confidential data. This includes a specific class of bugs called Insecure Direct Object Reference ( IDOR ), a type of access control flaw that occurs when an application utilizes user-supplied input or an identifier for direct access to an internal resource, such as a database record, without any additional validations. A&nbsp; typical example &nbsp;of an IDOR flaw is the ability of a user to trivially change the URL (e.g., https://example[.]site/details.php?id= 12345 ) to obtain unauthorized data of another transaction (i.e., https://example[.]site/details.php?id= 67890 ).

New Malvertising Campaign Distributing Trojanized IT Tools via Google and Bing Search Ads<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/new-malvertising-campaign-distributing.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malvertising campaign has been observed leveraging ads on Google Search and Bing to target users seeking IT tools like AnyDesk, Cisco AnyConnect VPN, and WinSCP, and trick them into downloading trojanized installers with an aim to breach enterprise networks and likely carry out future ransomware attacks. Dubbed&nbsp; Nitrogen , the "opportunistic" activity is designed to deploy second-stage attack tools such as Cobalt Strike, Sophos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday analysis. Nitrogen was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by eSentire in June 2023, detailing an infection chain that redirects users to compromised WordPress sites hosting malicious ISO image files that ultimately culminate in the delivery of Python scripts and Cobalt Strike Beacons onto the targeted system. Then earlier this month, Trend Micro&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;a similar attack sequence in which a fraudulent WinSCP application functioned as a stepping stone for a BlackCat ransomware attack.

The 4 Keys to Building Cloud Security Programs That Can Actually Shift Left<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/the-4-keys-to-building-cloud-security.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As cloud applications are built, tested and updated, they wind their way through an ever-complex series of different tools and teams. Across hundreds or even thousands of technologies that make up the patchwork quilt of development and cloud environments, security processes are all too often applied in only the final phases of software development.&nbsp; Placing security at the very end of the production pipeline puts both devs and security on the back foot. Developers want to build and ship secure apps; security teams want to support this process by strengthening application security. However, today's security processes are legacy approaches that once worked brilliantly for the tight constraints of on-prem production, but struggle in quasi-public, ever-shifting cloud environments. As a result, security is an afterthought, and any attempt to squeeze siloed security into agile SDLC can&nbsp; swell the cost of patching by 600% . A new cloud security operating model is long overdue. Shift-le

Misconfigured and poorly secured Apache Tomcat servers are being targeted as part of a new campaign designed to deliver the&nbsp; Mirai botnet malware &nbsp;and cryptocurrency miners. The findings come courtesy of Aqua, which detected more than 800 attacks against its Tomcat server honeypots over a two-year time period, with 96% of the attacks linked to the Mirai botnet. Of these attack attempts, 20% (or 152) entailed the use of a web shell script dubbed "neww" that originated from 24 unique IP addresses, with 68% of them originating from a single IP address (104.248.157[.]218). "The threat actor scanned for Tomcat servers and launched a brute force attack against it, attempting to gain access to the Tomcat web application manager by trying different combinations of credentials associated with it," Aqua security researcher Nitzan Yaakov&nbsp; said .

A city court in Moscow on Wednesday convicted Group-IB co-founder and CEO Ilya Sachkov of "high treason" and jailed him for 14 years in a "strict regime colony" over accusations of passing information to foreign spies. "The court found Sachkov guilty under Article 275 of the Russian Criminal Code (high treason) sentencing him to 14 years of incarceration in a maximum-security jail, restriction of freedom for one year and a fine of 500,000 rubles (about $5,550)," state news agency TASS&nbsp; reported . Sachkov, who has been in custody&nbsp; since September 2021 &nbsp;and denied wrongdoing, had been accused of handing over classified information to foreign intelligence in 2011, which the prosecutors said caused reputational damage to Russia's national interests. The exact nature of the charges is unclear.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday approved new rules that require publicly traded companies to publicize details of a cyber attack within four days of identifying that it has a "material" impact on their finances, marking a major shift in how computer breaches are disclosed. "Whether a company loses a factory in a fire — or millions of files in a cybersecurity incident — it may be material to investors," SEC chair Gary Gensler&nbsp; said . "Currently, many public companies provide cybersecurity disclosure to investors. I think companies and investors alike, however, would benefit if this disclosure were made in a more consistent, comparable, and decision-useful way." To that end, the new obligations mandate that companies reveal the incident's nature, scope, and timing, as well as its impact. This disclosure, however, may be delayed by an additional period of up to 60 days should it be determined that giving out such specific

A deeper analysis of a recently discovered malware called&nbsp; Decoy Dog &nbsp;has revealed that it's a significant upgrade over the&nbsp; Pupy RAT , an open-source remote access trojan it's modeled on. "Decoy Dog has a full suite of powerful, previously unknown capabilities – including the ability to move victims to another controller, allowing them to maintain communication with compromised machines and remain hidden for long periods of time," Infoblox&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. "Some victims have actively communicated with a Decoy Dog server for over a year." Other new features allow the malware to execute arbitrary Java code on the client and connect to emergency controllers using a mechanism that's similar to a traditional DNS domain generation algorithm ( DGA ), with the Decoy Dog domains engineered to respond to replayed DNS queries from breached clients. The sophisticated toolkit was&nbsp; first discovered &nbsp;by the cybersecurity firm in early April 2023 after

A new study conducted by Uptycs has uncovered a stark increase in the distribution of information stealing (a.k.a. infostealer or stealer) malware. Incidents have more than doubled in Q1 2023, indicating an alarming trend that threatens global organizations. According to the new Uptycs' whitepaper,&nbsp; Stealers are Organization Killers , a variety of new info stealers have emerged this year, preying on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. Telegram has notably been used extensively by these malware authors for command, control, and data exfiltration. What is a Stealer? A stealer is a type of malware that targets its victim by stealing sensitive information that can include passwords, login credentials, and other personal data. After collecting such data, the stealer sends it to the threat actor's command and control (C2) system.

Following the footsteps of&nbsp; WormGPT , threat actors are advertising yet another cybercrime generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool dubbed&nbsp; FraudGPT &nbsp;on various dark web marketplaces and Telegram channels. "This is an AI bot, exclusively targeted for offensive purposes, such as crafting spear phishing emails, creating cracking tools, carding, etc.," Netenrich security researcher Rakesh Krishnan &nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday. The cybersecurity firm said the offering has been circulating since at least July 22, 2023, for a subscription cost of $200 a month (or $1,000 for six months and $1,700 for a year). "If your [sic] looking for a Chat GPT alternative designed to provide a wide range of exclusive tools, features, and capabilities tailored to anyone's individuals with no boundaries then look no further!," claims the actor, who goes by the online alias CanadianKingpin. The author also states that the tool could be used to write malicious code, c

A new malware family called&nbsp; Realst &nbsp;has become the latest to target Apple macOS systems, with a third of the samples already designed to infect macOS 14 Sonoma, the upcoming major release of the operating system. Written in the Rust programming language, the malware is distributed in the form of bogus blockchain games and is capable of "emptying crypto wallets and stealing stored password and browser data" from both Windows and macOS machines. Realst was first discovered in the wild by security researcher&nbsp; iamdeadlyz . "Realst Infostealer is distributed via malicious websites advertising fake blockchain games with names such as Brawl Earth, WildWorld, Dawnland, Destruction, Evolion, Pearl, Olymp of Reptiles, and SaintLegend," SentinelOne security researcher Phil Stokes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A severe privilege escalation issue impacting MikroTik RouterOS could be weaponized by remote malicious actors to execute arbitrary code and seize full control of vulnerable devices. Cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-30799 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.1), the shortcoming is expected to put approximately 500,000 and 900,000 RouterOS systems at risk of exploitation via their web and/or Winbox interfaces, respectively, VulnCheck disclosed in a Tuesday report. "CVE-2023-30799 does require authentication," security researcher Jacob Baines&nbsp; said . "In fact, the vulnerability itself is a simple privilege escalation from admin to 'super-admin' which results in access to an arbitrary function. Acquiring credentials to RouterOS systems is easier than one might expect." This is because the Mikrotik RouterOS operating system does not offer any protection against password brute-force attacks and ships with a well-known default "admin" user, with its password being an empty string

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
North Korean nation-state actors affiliated with the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) have been attributed to the&nbsp; JumpCloud hack &nbsp;following an operational security (OPSEC) blunder that exposed their actual IP address. Google-owned threat intelligence firm Mandiant attributed the activity to a threat actor it tracks under the name UNC4899, which likely shares overlaps with clusters already being monitored as Jade Sleet and TraderTraitor, a group with a history of striking blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. UNC4899 also overlaps with&nbsp; APT43 , another hacking crew associated with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) that was unmasked earlier this March as conducting a series of campaigns to gather intelligence and siphon cryptocurrency from targeted companies. The adversarial collective's modus operandi is characterized by the use of Operational Relay Boxes ( ORBs ) using L2TP IPsec tunnels along with commercial VPN providers to disguise the attacker's

As the number of people using macOS keeps going up, so does the desire of hackers to take advantage of flaws in Apple's operating system.&nbsp; What Are the Rising Threats to macOS? There is a common misconception among macOS fans that Apple devices are immune to hacking and malware infection. However, users have been facing more and more dangers recently. Inventive attackers are specifically targeting Mac systems, as seen with the "Geacon" Cobalt Strike tool attack. This tool enables them to perform malicious actions such as data theft, privilege elevation, and remote device control, placing the security and privacy of Mac users at grave risk. Earlier this year, researchers also uncovered the MacStealer malware, which also stole sensitive data from Apple users. Documents, iCloud keychain data, browser cookies, credit card credentials – nothing is safe from the prying eyes.&nbsp; But that's not all.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A set of five security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the Terrestrial Trunked Radio ( TETRA ) standard for radio communication used widely by government entities and critical infrastructure sectors, including what's believed to be an intentional backdoor that could have potentially exposed sensitive information. The issues, discovered by Midnight Blue in 2021 and held back until now, have been collectively called&nbsp; TETRA:BURST . There is no conclusive evidence to determine that the vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild to date. "Depending on infrastructure and device configurations, these vulnerabilities allow for real time decryption, harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks, message injection, user deanonymization, or session key pinning," the Netherlands-based cybersecurity company&nbsp; said .

How do you overcome today's talent gap in cybersecurity? This is a crucial issue — particularly when you find executive leadership or the board asking pointed questions about your security team's ability to defend the organization against new and current threats. This is why many security leaders find themselves turning to managed security services like MDR ( managed detection and response ), which can offer an immediate solution. The right MDR partner can act as an extension of your existing team, while offering a fast and budget-friendly option for uplevelling security at organizations of virtually any size. Here's a look at common staffing challenges that MDR helps solve: Overcoming Cybersecurity Talent Challenges From stopping ransomware to securing the attack surface of the environment, most security teams have more to do than they can manage.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new security vulnerability has been discovered in AMD's Zen 2 architecture-based processors that could be exploited to extract sensitive data such as encryption keys and passwords. Discovered by Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy, the flaw – codenamed&nbsp; Zenbleed &nbsp;and tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-20593 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.5) – allows data exfiltration at the rate of 30 kb per core, per second. The issue is part of a broader category of weaknesses called&nbsp; speculative execution attacks , in which the optimization technique widely used in modern CPUs is abused to access cryptographic keys from CPU registers. "Under specific microarchitectural circumstances, a register in 'Zen 2' CPUs may not be written to 0 correctly," AMD&nbsp; explained &nbsp;in an advisory. "This may cause data from another process and/or thread to be stored in the YMM register , which may allow an attacker to potentially access sensitive information."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ivanti is warning users to update their Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) mobile device management software (formerly MobileIron Core) to the latest version that fixes an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability. Dubbed&nbsp; CVE-2023-35078 , the issue has been described as a remote unauthenticated API access vulnerability that impacts currently supported version 11.4 releases 11.10, 11.9, and 11.8 as well as older releases. It has the maximum severity rating of 10 on the CVSS scale. "An authentication bypass vulnerability in Ivanti EPMM allows unauthorized users to access restricted functionality or resources of the application without proper authentication," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a terse advisory. "If exploited, this vulnerability enables an unauthorized, remote (internet-facing) actor to potentially access users' personally identifiable information and make limited changes to the server." The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said an

Apple Rolls Out Urgent Patches for Zero-Day Flaws Impacting iPhones, iPads and Macs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/apple-rolls-out-urgent-patches-for-zero.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple has&nbsp; rolled out security updates &nbsp;to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and Safari to address several security vulnerabilities, including one actively exploited zero-day bug in the wild. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38606 , the shortcoming resides in the kernel and permits a malicious app to modify sensitive kernel state potentially. The company said it was addressed with improved state management. "Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited against versions of iOS released before iOS 15.7.1," the tech giant noted in its advisory. It's worth noting that CVE-2023-38606 is the third security vulnerability discovered in connection with&nbsp; Operation Triangulation , a sophisticated mobile cyber espionage campaign targeting iOS devices since 2019 using a zero-click exploit chain. The other two zero-days,&nbsp; CVE-2023-32434 and CVE-2023-32435 , were patched by Apple last month. Kaspersky researchers Valentin Pashkov, Mikhail Vinogradov, Georgy Kuc

Critical Zero-Days in Atera Windows Installers Expose Users to Privilege Escalation Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/critical-zero-days-in-atera-windows.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows Installers for the Atera remote monitoring and management software could act as a springboard to launch privilege escalation attacks. The flaws, discovered by Mandiant on February 28, 2023, have been assigned the identifiers&nbsp; CVE-2023-26077 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-26078 , with the issues remediated in versions 1.8.3.7 and 1.8.4.9 released by Atera on April 17, 2023, and June 26, 2023, respectively. "The ability to initiate an operation from a NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context can present potential security risks if not properly managed," security researcher Andrew Oliveau&nbsp; said . "For instance, misconfigured&nbsp; Custom Actions &nbsp;running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM can be exploited by attackers to execute local privilege escalation attacks." Successful exploitation of such weaknesses could pave the way for the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Both the flaws reside in the MSI installer's repair functionality, potentially crea

Google has announced that it intends to add support for Message Layer Security ( MLS ) to its Messages service for Android and open source implementation of the specification. "Most modern consumer messaging platforms (including Google Messages) support end-to-end encryption, but users today are limited to communicating with contacts who use the same platform," Giles Hogben, privacy engineering director at Google,&nbsp; said . "This is why Google is strongly supportive of regulatory efforts that require interoperability for large end-to-end messaging platforms." The development comes as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)&nbsp; released &nbsp;the core specification of the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol as a Request for Comments ( RFC 9420 ). Some of the other major companies that have thrown their weight behind the protocol are Amazon Web Services (AWS) Wickr, Cisco, Cloudflare, The Matrix.org Foundation, Mozilla, Phoenix R&amp;D, and Wire.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The healthcare industry is under a constant barrage of cyberattacks. It has traditionally been one of the most frequently targeted industries, and things haven't changed in 2023. The U.S. Government's Office for Civil Rights reported&nbsp; 145 data breaches &nbsp;in the United States during the first quarter of this year. That follows 707 incidents a year ago, during which over 50 million records were stolen. Health records often include names, birth dates, social security numbers, and addresses. This treasure trove of data is used in identity theft, tax fraud, and other crimes. It is the high value of the data that makes healthcare applications such a promising target. The healthcare industry was hesitant to adopt SaaS applications. However, SaaS applications lead to better collaboration among medical professionals, leading to improved patient outcomes. That, combined with SaaS's ability to reduce costs and improve financial performance, has led to the industry fully embracing SaaS solutions

Details have emerged about a now-patched flaw in OpenSSH that could be potentially exploited to run arbitrary commands remotely on compromised hosts under specific conditions. "This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable OpenSSH's forwarded ssh-agent," Saeed Abbasi, manager of vulnerability research at Qualys,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis last week. The vulnerability is being tracked under the CVE identifier&nbsp; CVE-2023-38408 &nbsp;(CVSS score: N/A). It impacts all versions of OpenSSH before&nbsp; 9.3p2 . OpenSSH is a popular connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol that's used for encrypting all traffic to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. Successful exploitation requires the presence of certain libraries on the victim system and that the SSH authentication agent is&nbsp; forwarded &nbsp;to an attacker-controlled system.

The npm packages have since been reported and taken down. The names of the packages were not disclosed. In the first attack, the malware author is said to have uploaded a couple of packages to the npm registry in early April 2023 by posing as an employee of the target bank.

The recent attack against&nbsp; Microsoft's email infrastructure &nbsp;by a Chinese nation-state actor referred to as Storm-0558 is said to have a broader scope than previously thought. According to cloud security company Wiz, the inactive Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key used to forge Azure Active Directory (Azure AD or AAD) tokens to gain illicit access to Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Outlook.com could also have allowed the adversary to forge access tokens for various types of Azure AD applications. This&nbsp; includes &nbsp;every application that supports personal account authentication, such as OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams; customers applications that support the "Login with Microsoft functionality," and multi-tenant applications in certain conditions. "Everything in the world of Microsoft leverages Azure Active Directory auth tokens for access," Ami Luttwak, chief technology officer and co-founder of Wiz, said in a statement.

A new variant of&nbsp; AsyncRAT &nbsp;malware dubbed&nbsp; HotRat &nbsp;is being distributed via free, pirated versions of popular software and utilities such as video games, image and sound editing software, and Microsoft Office. "HotRat malware equips attackers with a wide array of capabilities, such as stealing login credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, screen capturing, keylogging, installing more malware, and gaining access to or altering clipboard data," Avast security researcher Martin a Milánek&nbsp; said . The Czech cybersecurity firm said the trojan has been prevalent in the wild since at least in October 2022, with a majority of the infections concentrated in Thailand, Guyana, Libya, Suriname, Mali, Pakistan, Cambodia, South Africa, and India.

Regardless of the country, local government is essential in most citizens' lives. It provides many day-to-day services and handles various issues. Therefore, their effects can be far-reaching and deeply felt when security failures occur. In early 2023, Oakland, California, &nbsp;fell victim to a ransomware attack . Although city officials have not disclosed how the attack occurred, experts suspect a phishing email is the most likely cause. As a result, city officials brought down their servers to contain the attack. Governments have been the target to many ransomware attacks &nbsp;and breaches. As most local governments maintain a small IT staff, there is potential for shared passwords, reused credentials, and a lack of multi-factor authentication security, exposing vulnerabilities for a breach.&nbsp; Oakland is Breached It was first noticed on a Wednesday evening in early February; when Oakland, California city officials quickly took most services' backend servers offline and posted a m

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Several distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnets have been observed exploiting a critical flaw in Zyxel devices that came to light in April 2023 to gain remote control of vulnerable systems. "Through the capture of exploit traffic, the attacker's IP address was identified, and it was determined that the attacks were occurring in multiple regions, including Central America, North America, East Asia, and South Asia," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . The flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-28771 (CVSS score: 9.8), is a command injection bug affecting multiple firewall models that could potentially allow an unauthorized actor to execute arbitrary code by sending a specifically crafted packet to the targeted appliance. Last month, the Shadowserver Foundation&nbsp; warned &nbsp;that the flaw was being "actively exploited to build a Mirai-like botnet" at least since May 26, 2023, an indication of how abuse of&nbsp; servers running unpatched software &nbsp;is on the rise.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an advisory on Thursday warning that the newly disclosed critical security flaw in Citrix NetScaler Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Gateway devices is being abused to drop web shells on vulnerable systems. "In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day to drop a web shell on a critical infrastructure organization's non-production environment NetScaler ADC appliance," the agency&nbsp; said . "The web shell enabled the actors to perform discovery on the victim's active directory (AD) and collect and exfiltrate AD data. The actors attempted to move laterally to a domain controller but network segmentation controls for the appliance blocked movement." The shortcoming in question is&nbsp; CVE-2023-3519 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), a code injection bug that could result in unauthenticated remote code execution.

Two more security flaws have been disclosed in AMI MegaRAC Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) software that, if successfully exploited, could allow threat actors to remotely commandeer vulnerable servers and deploy malware.

"They can be exploited by remote attackers having access to Redfish remote management interfaces, or from a compromised host operating system." To make matters worse, the shortcomings could also be weaponized to drop persistent firmware implants that are immune to operating system reinstalls and hard drive replacements, brick motherboard components, cause physical damage through overvolting attacks, and induce indefinite reboot loops.

Mallox ransomware activities in 2023 have witnessed a 174% increase when compared to the previous year, new findings from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 reveal. "Mallox ransomware, like many other ransomware threat actors, follows the double extortion trend: stealing data before encrypting an organization's files, and then threatening to publish the stolen data on a leak site as leverage to convince victims to pay the ransom fee," security researchers Lior Rochberger and Shimi Cohen&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report shared with The Hacker News. Mallox is linked to a threat actor that's also linked to&nbsp; other ransomware strains , such as TargetCompany, Tohnichi, Fargo, and, most recently, Xollam. It first burst onto the scene in June 2021. Some of the prominent sectors targeted by Mallox are manufacturing, professional and legal services, and wholesale and retail.

Multiple security flaws have been disclosed in Apache OpenMeetings, a web conferencing solution, that could be potentially exploited by malicious actors to seize control of admin accounts and run malicious code on susceptible servers. "Attackers can bring the application into an unexpected state, which allows them to take over any user account, including the admin account," Sonar vulnerability researcher Stefan Schiller&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.

North Korean State-Sponsored Hackers Suspected in JumpCloud Supply Chain Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/north-korean-state-sponsored-hackers.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of the indicators of compromise ( IoCs ) associated with the JumpCloud hack has uncovered evidence pointing to the involvement of North Korean state-sponsored groups, in a style that's reminiscent of the&nbsp; supply chain attack targeting 3CX . The findings come from SentinelOne, which&nbsp; mapped out &nbsp;the infrastructure pertaining to the intrusion to uncover underlying patterns. It's worth noting that JumpCloud, last week,&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the attack to an unnamed "sophisticated nation-state sponsored threat actor." "The North Korean threat actors demonstrate a high level of creativity and strategic awareness in their targeting strategies," SentinelOne security researcher Tom Hegel told The Hacker News. "The research findings reveal a successful and multifaceted approach employed by these actors to infiltrate developer environments." "They actively seek access to tools and networks that can serve as gateways to more extensive opportunitie

If it seems like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) has been around forever, it's because it has (at least compared to the many technologies that rise and fall within just a few years.) The initial version, known as "Remote Desktop Protocol 4.0," was released in 1996 as part of the Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server edition and allowed users to remotely access and control Windows-based computers over a network connection.&nbsp; In the intervening decades, RDP has become a widely used protocol for remote access and administration of Windows-based systems. RDP plays a crucial role in enabling remote work, IT support, and system management and has served as the foundation for various remote desktop and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solutions.&nbsp; The downside of RDP's widespread use is that a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in an RDP gateway can have severe consequences, potentially leading to significant damage and compromising the security and integrity of the affec

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The defense sector in Ukraine and Eastern Europe has been targeted by a novel .NET-based backdoor called&nbsp; DeliveryCheck &nbsp;(aka CAPIBAR or GAMEDAY) that's capable of delivering next-stage payloads. The Microsoft threat intelligence team, in&nbsp; collaboration &nbsp;with the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA), attributed the attacks to a Russian nation-state actor known as&nbsp; Turla , which is also tracked under the names Iron Hunter, Secret Blizzard (formerly Krypton), Uroburos, Venomous Bear, and Waterbug. It's linked to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB). "DeliveryCheck is distributed via email as documents with malicious macros," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets. "It persists via a scheduled task that downloads and launches it in memory. It also contacts a C2 server to retrieve tasks, which can include the launch of arbitrary payloads embedded in XSLT stylesheets." Successful initial access is also accompanied in some cases by t

New P2PInfect Worm Targeting Redis Servers on Linux and Windows Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/new-p2pinfect-worm-targeting-redis.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new cloud targeting, peer-to-peer (P2P) worm called&nbsp; P2PInfect &nbsp;that targets vulnerable Redis instances for follow-on exploitation. "P2PInfect exploits Redis servers running on both Linux and Windows Operating Systems making it more scalable and potent than other worms," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers William Gamazo and Nathaniel Quist&nbsp; said . "This worm is also written in Rust, a highly scalable and cloud-friendly programming language." It's estimated that as many as 934 unique Redis systems may be vulnerable to the threat. The first known instance of P2PInfect was detected on July 11, 2023. A notable characteristic of the worm is its ability to infects vulnerable Redis instances by exploiting a critical Lua sandbox escape vulnerability,&nbsp; CVE-2022-0543 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 10.0), which has been previously exploited to deliver multiple&nbsp; malware families &nbsp;such as&nbsp; Muhstik ,&nbsp; Redigo , and&nbsp; HeadCrab &nbsp;over the past ye

Adobe has released a fresh round of updates to address an incomplete fix for a recently disclosed ColdFusion flaw that has come under active exploitation in the wild. The critical shortcoming, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38205 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5), has been described as an instance of improper access control that could result in a security bypass. It impacts the following versions: ColdFusion 2023 (Update 2 and earlier versions) ColdFusion 2021 (Update 8 and earlier versions), and ColdFusion 2018 (Update 18 and earlier versions) "Adobe is aware that CVE-2023-38205 has been exploited in the wild in limited attacks targeting Adobe ColdFusion," the company&nbsp; said . The update also addresses two other flaws, including a critical deserialization bug ( CVE-2023-38204 , CVSS score: 9.8) that could lead to remote code execution and a second improper access control flaw that could also pave the way for a security bypass ( CVE-2023-38206 , CVSS score: 5.3).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Attack surfaces are growing faster than security teams can keep up. To stay ahead, you need to know what's exposed and where attackers are most likely to strike. With cloud migration dramatically increasing the number of internal and external targets, prioritizing threats and managing your attack surface from an attacker's perspective has never been more important. Let's look at why it's growing, and how to monitor and manage it properly with tools like&nbsp; Intruder . What is your attack surface? First, it's important to understand that your attack surface is the sum of your digital assets that are 'exposed' – whether the digital assets are secure or vulnerable, known or unknown, in active use or not. This attack surface changes continuously over time, and includes digital assets that are on-premises, in the cloud, in subsidiary networks, and in third-party environments. In short, it's anything that a hacker can attack.&nbsp; What is attack surface managemen

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have&nbsp; released &nbsp;a set of recommendations to address security concerns with 5G standalone network slicing and harden them against possible threats. "The threat landscape in 5G is dynamic; due to this, advanced monitoring, auditing, and other analytical capabilities are required to meet certain levels of network slicing service level requirements over time," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Security Agency (NSA)&nbsp; said . 5G is the fifth-generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, offering increased data speeds and lower latency. Network slicing is an architectural model that allows mobile service providers to partition their network up into several independent "slices" in order to create virtual networks that cater to different clients and use cases.

Bad.Build Flaw in Google Cloud Build Raises Concerns of Privilege Escalation<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/badbuild-flaw-in-google-cloud-build.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a privilege escalation vulnerability in Google Cloud that could enable malicious actors tamper with application images and infect users, leading to supply chain attacks. The issue, dubbed&nbsp; Bad.Build , is rooted in the&nbsp; Google Cloud Build service , according to cloud security firm Orca, which discovered and reported the issue. "By abusing the flaw and enabling an impersonation of the default Cloud Build service, attackers can manipulate images in the Google Artifact Registry and inject malicious code," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement shared with The Hacker News. "Any applications built from the manipulated images are then affected and, if the malformed applications are meant to be deployed on customer's environments, the risk crosses from the supplying organization's environment to their customers' environments, constituting a major supply chain risk." Following responsible disclosure, Google has&nbsp; issued &nbsp;a

The U.S. government on Tuesday added two foreign commercial spyware vendors, Cytrox and Intellexa, to an economic blocklist for weaponizing cyber exploits to gain unauthorized access to devices and "threatening the privacy and security of individuals and organizations worldwide." This includes the companies' corporate holdings in Hungary (Cytrox Holdings Crt), North Macedonia (Cytrox AD), Greece (Intellexa S.A.), and Ireland (Intellexa Limited). By adding to the economic denylist, it prohibits U.S. companies from transacting with these businesses. "Recognizing the increasingly key role that surveillance technology plays in enabling campaigns of repression and other human rights abuses, the Commerce Department's action today targets these entities' ability to access commodities, software, and technology that could contribute to the development of surveillance tools that pose a risk of misuse in violations or abuses of human rights," the Bureau of Indus

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unidentified threat actor compromised an application used by multiple entities in Pakistan to deliver&nbsp; ShadowPad , a successor to the PlugX backdoor that's commonly associated with&nbsp; Chinese hacking crews . Targets included a Pakistan government entity, a public sector bank, and a telecommunications provider, according to Trend Micro. The infections took place between mid-February 2022 and September 2022. The cybersecurity company said the incident could be the result of a supply-chain attack, in which a legitimate piece of software used by targets of interest is trojanized to deploy malware capable of gathering sensitive information from compromised systems. The attack chain takes the form of a malicious installer for&nbsp; E-Office , an application developed by the National Information Technology Board (NITB) of Pakistan to help government departments go paperless. It's currently not clear how the backdoored E-Office installer was delivered to the targets. That said, there&amp;

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The financially motivated threat actor known as FIN8 has been observed using a "revamped" version of a backdoor called&nbsp; Sardonic &nbsp;to deliver the&nbsp; BlackCat ransomware . According to the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, the development is an attempt on the part of the e-crime group to diversify its focus and maximize profits from infected entities. The intrusion attempt took place in December 2022. FIN8 is being tracked by the cybersecurity company under the name Syssphinx. Known to be active since at least 2016, the adversary was originally attributed to attacks targeting point-of-sale (PoS) systems using malware such as PUNCHTRACK and BADHATCH. The group resurfaced after more than a year in March 2021 with an updated version of BADHATCH, following it up with a completely new bespoke implant called Sardonic , which was disclosed by Bitdefender in August 2021.

Conor Brian Fitzpatrick , the owner of the now-defunct BreachForums website, has pleaded guilty to charges related to his operation of the cybercrime forum as well as having child pornography images.

It was shut down in March 2023 shortly after&nbsp; Fitzpatrick's arrest &nbsp;in New York. As many as 888 databases consisting of 14 billion individual records are estimated to have been found in total. The forum had over 333,000 members prior to its takedown.

Threat actors are actively exploiting a recently disclosed critical security flaw in the WooCommerce Payments WordPress plugin as part of a massive targeted campaign. The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-28121 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), is a case of authentication bypass that enables unauthenticated attackers to impersonate arbitrary users and perform some actions as the impersonated user, including an administrator, potentially leading to site takeover. "Large-scale attacks against the vulnerability, assigned CVE-2023-28121, began on Thursday, July 14, 2023 and continued over the weekend, peaking at 1.3 million attacks against 157,000 sites on Saturday, July 16, 2023," Wordfence security researcher Ram Gall&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday post. Versions 4.8.0 through 5.6.1 of WooCommerce Payments are vulnerable. The plugin is installed on over 600,000 sites.

JumpCloud Blames 'Sophisticated Nation-State' Actor for Security Breach<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/jumpcloud-blames-sophisticated-nation.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A little over a week after&nbsp; JumpCloud reset API keys of customers &nbsp;impacted by a security incident, the company said the intrusion was the work of a sophisticated nation-state actor. The adversary "gained unauthorized access to our systems to target a small and specific set of our customers," Bob Phan, chief information security officer (CISO) at JumpCloud,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post-mortem report. "The attack vector used by the threat actor has been mitigated." The U.S. enterprise software firm said it identified anomalous activity on June 27, 2023, on an internal orchestration system, which it traced back to a spear-phishing campaign mounted by the attacker on June 22. While JumpCloud said it took security steps to shield its network by rotating credentials and rebuilding its systems, it wasn't until July 5 when it detected "unusual activity" in the commands framework for a small set of customers, prompting a forced-rotation of all admin API keys.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are taking advantage of Android's&nbsp; WebAPK technology &nbsp;to trick unsuspecting users into installing malicious web apps on Android phones that are designed to capture sensitive personal information. "The attack began with victims receiving SMS messages suggesting the need to update a mobile banking application," researchers from CSIRT KNF&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis released last week. "The link contained in the message led to a site that used WebAPK technology to install a malicious application on the victim's device." The application impersonates PKO Bank Polski, a multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in Warsaw. Details of the campaign were&nbsp; first shared &nbsp;by Polish cybersecurity firm RIFFSEC. WebAPK allows users to install progressive web apps (PWAs) to their home screen on Android devices without having to use the Google Play Store.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft Word documents exploiting known remote code execution flaws are being used as phishing lures to drop malware called&nbsp; LokiBot &nbsp;on compromised systems. "LokiBot, also known as Loki PWS, has been a well-known information-stealing Trojan active since 2015," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . "It primarily targets Windows systems and aims to gather sensitive information from infected machines." The cybersecurity company, which spotted the campaign in May 2023, said the attacks take advantage of&nbsp; CVE-2021-40444 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2022-30190 &nbsp;(aka Follina) to achieve code execution. The Word file that weaponizes CVE-2021-40444 contains an external GoFile link embedded within an XML file that leads to the download of an HTML file, which exploits Follina to download a next-stage payload, an injector module written in Visual Basic that decrypts and launches LokiBot.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
With generative artificial intelligence (AI) becoming all the rage these days, it's perhaps not surprising that the technology has been repurposed by malicious actors to their own advantage, enabling avenues for accelerated cybercrime. According to findings from SlashNext, a new generative AI cybercrime tool called&nbsp; WormGPT &nbsp;has been advertised on underground forums as a way for adversaries to launch sophisticated phishing and business email compromise ( BEC ) attacks. "This tool presents itself as a blackhat alternative to GPT models, designed specifically for malicious activities," security researcher Daniel Kelley&nbsp; said . "Cybercriminals can use such technology to automate the creation of highly convincing fake emails, personalized to the recipient, thus increasing the chances of success for the attack." The author of the software has described it as the "biggest enemy of the well-known ChatGPT" that "lets you do all sorts of illegal stuff.

"Storm-0558 acquired an inactive MSA consumer signing key and used it to forge authentication tokens for Azure AD enterprise and MSA consumer to access OWA and Outlook.com," the tech giant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deeper analysis of the campaign. "The method by which the actor acquired the key is a matter of ongoing investigation." "Though the key was intended only for MSA accounts, a validation issue allowed this key to be trusted for signing Azure AD tokens. This issue has been corrected." It's not immediately clear if the token validation issue was exploited as a "zero-day vulnerability" or if Microsoft was already aware of the problem before it came under in-the-wild abuse. The attacks singl

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in various services, including Honeywell Experion distributed control system (DCS) and QuickBlox, that, if successfully exploited, could result in severe compromise of affected systems. Dubbed Crit.IX, the nine flaws in the Honeywell Experion DCS platform allow for "unauthorized remote code execution, which means an attacker would have the power to take over the devices and alter the operation of the DCS controller, whilst also hiding the alterations from the engineering workstation that manages the controller," Armis said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. Put differently, the issues relate to lack of encryption and adequate authentication mechanisms in a proprietary protocol called Control Data Access (CDA) that's used to communicate between Experion Servers and C300 controllers, effectively enabling a threat actor to take over the devices and alter the operation of the DCS controller.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As security practices continue to evolve, one primary concern persists in the minds of security professionals—the risk of employees unintentionally or deliberately exposing vital information. Insider threats, whether originating from deliberate actions or accidental incidents, pose a significant challenge to safeguarding sensitive data. To effectively address insider risks, organizations must adopt a holistic approach that encompasses technical, procedural, and human elements. While access controls, encryption, and monitoring systems are crucial for identifying and mitigating unauthorized access and suspicious activities, the increasing prevalence of cloud-based environments and the surge in SaaS application usage demand a fresh perspective on Insider Risk Management from a SaaS security standpoint. Stay ahead of the game by embracing the SaaS security lens. Join us for an enlightening webinar where we will demonstrate how security practitioners can proactively adapt their approach

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
All-In-One Security (AIOS), a WordPress plugin installed on over one million sites, has issued a security update after a bug introduced in version 5.1.9 of the software caused users' passwords being added to the database in plaintext format. "A malicious site administrator (i.e. a user already logged into the site as an admin) could then have read them," UpdraftPlus, the maintainers of AIOS,&nbsp; said . "This would be a problem if those site administrators were to try out those passwords on other services where your users might have used the same password. If those other services' logins are not protected by two-factor authentication, this could be a risk to the affected website." The issue surfaced nearly three weeks ago when a user of the plugin&nbsp; reported &nbsp;the behavior, stating they were "absolutely shocked that a security plugin is making such a basic security 101 error." AIOS also noted that the updates remove the existing logged data from th

A malicious actor has been linked to a cloud credential stealing campaign in June 2023 that's focused on Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, marking the adversary's expansion in targeting beyond Amazon Web Services (AWS).

They also overlap with an ongoing TeamTNT campaign&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by Aqua called Silentbob that leverages misconfigured cloud services to drop malware as part of what's said to be a testing effort, while also linking&nbsp; SCARLETEEL &nbsp;attacks to the threat actor, citing infrastructure commonalities.

A new malware strain has been found covertly targeting small office/home office (SOHO) routers for more than two years, infiltrating over 70,000 devices and creating a botnet with 40,000 nodes spanning 20 countries. Lumen Black Lotus Labs has dubbed the malware&nbsp; AVrecon , making it the third such strain to focus on SOHO routers after&nbsp; ZuoRAT &nbsp;and&nbsp; HiatusRAT &nbsp;over the past year. "This makes AVrecon one of the largest SOHO router-targeting botnets ever seen," the company&nbsp; said . "The purpose of the campaign appears to be the creation of a covert network to quietly enable a range of criminal activities from password spraying to digital advertising fraud." A majority of the infections are located in the U.K. and the U.S., followed by Argentina, Nigeria, Brazil, Italy, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Russia, and South Africa, among others.

Government entities, military organizations, and civilian users in Ukraine and Poland have been targeted as part of a series of campaigns designed to steal sensitive data and gain persistent remote access to the infected systems.

"The attacks used a multistage infection chain initiated with malicious Microsoft Office documents, most commonly using Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint file formats," Cisco Talos researcher Vanja Svajcer&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.

As many as 196 hosts have been infected as part of an aggressive cloud campaign mounted by the TeamTNT group called&nbsp; Silentbob . "The botnet run by TeamTNT has set its sights on Docker and Kubernetes environments, Redis servers, Postgres databases, Hadoop clusters, Tomcat and Nginx servers, Weave Scope, SSH, and Jupyter applications," Aqua security researchers Ofek Itach and Assaf Morag&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The focus this time seems to be more on infecting systems and testing the botnet, rather than deploying cryptominers for profit." The development arrives a week after the cloud security company&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;an intrusion set linked to the TeamTNT group that targets exposed JupyterLab and Docker APIs to deploy the Tsunami malware and hijack system resources to run a cryptocurrency miner. The latest findings suggest a broader campaign and the use of a larger attack infrastructure than previously thought, including various shell script

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In a sign that cybersecurity researchers continue to be under the radar of malicious actors, a proof-of-concept (PoC) has been discovered on GitHub, concealing a backdoor with a "crafty" persistence method. "In this instance, the PoC is a wolf in sheep's clothing, harboring malicious intent under the guise of a harmless learning tool," Uptycs researchers Nischay Hegde and Siddartha Malladi&nbsp; said . "Operating as a downloader, it silently dumps and executes a Linux bash script, all the while disguising its operations as a kernel-level process." The&nbsp; repository &nbsp;masquerades as a PoC for&nbsp; CVE-2023-35829 , a recently disclosed high-severity flaw in the Linux kernel. It has since been taken down, but not before it was forked 25 times.&nbsp; Another PoC &nbsp;shared by the same account, ChriSanders22, for&nbsp; CVE-2023-20871 , a privilege escalation bug impacting VMware Fusion, was forked twice.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has alerted of two security flaws impacting Rockwell Automation ControlLogix EtherNet/IP (ENIP) communication module models that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution and denial-of-service (DoS). "The results and impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities vary depending on the ControlLogix system configuration, but they could lead to denial or loss of control, denial or loss of view, theft of operational data, or manipulation of control for disruptive or destructive consequences on the industrial process for which the ControlLogix system is responsible," Draogos&nbsp; said . The list of flaws is as follows - CVE-2023-3595 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8) - An out-of-bounds write flaw impacting 1756 EN2* and 1756 EN3* products that could result in arbitrary code execution with persistence on the target system through maliciously crafted common industrial protocol ( CIP ) messages.

An unnamed Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agency in the U.S. detected anomalous email activity in mid-June 2023, leading to Microsoft's discovery of a new China-linked&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;targeting two dozen organizations.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Tuesday&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that it repelled a cyber attack staged by a Chinese nation-state actor targeting two dozen organizations, some of which include government agencies, in a cyber espionage campaign designed to acquire confidential data. The attacks, which commenced on May 15, 2023, entailed access to email accounts affecting approximately 25 entities and a small number of related individual consumer accounts. The tech giant attributed the campaign to Storm-0558, describing it as a nation-state activity group based out of China that primarily singles out government agencies in Western Europe. "They focus on espionage, data theft, and credential access," Microsoft&nbsp; said . "They are also known to use custom malware that Microsoft tracks as Cigril and Bling, for credential access." The breach is said to have been detected a month later on June 16, 2023, after an unidentified customer reported the anomalous email activity to the company. Microsoft sai

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a novel rootkit signed by Microsoft that's engineered to communicate with an actor-controlled attack infrastructure. Trend Micro has attributed the activity cluster to the same actor that was previously identified as behind the&nbsp; FiveSys rootkit , which came to light in October 2021. "This malicious actor originates from China and their main victims are the gaming sector in China," Trend Micro's Mahmoud Zohdy, Sherif Magdy, and Mohamed Fahmy&nbsp; said . Their malware seems to have passed through the Windows Hardware Quality Labs ( WHQL ) process for getting a valid signature. Multiple variants of the rootkit spanning eight different clusters have been discovered, with 75 such drivers signed using Microsoft's WHQL program in 2022 and 2023. Trend Micro's analysis of some of the samples has revealed the presence of debug messages in the source code, indicating that the operation is still in the development and testing phas

A new fileless attack dubbed&nbsp; PyLoose &nbsp;has been observed striking cloud workloads with the goal of delivering a cryptocurrency miner, new findings from Wiz reveal. "The attack consists of Python code that loads an XMRig Miner directly into memory using&nbsp; memfd , a known Linux fileless technique," security researchers Avigayil Mechtinger, Oren Ofer, and Itamar Gilad&nbsp; said . "This is the first publicly documented Python-based fileless attack targeting cloud workloads in the wild." The cloud security firm said it found nearly 200 instances where the attack method was employed for cryptocurrency mining. No other details about the threat actor are currently known other than the fact that they possess sophisticated capabilities. In the infection chain documented by Wiz, initial access is achieved through the exploitation of a publicly accessible Jupyter Notebook service that allowed for the execution of system commands using Python modules.

A Microsoft Windows policy loophole has been observed being exploited primarily by native Chinese-speaking threat actors to forge signatures on kernel-mode drivers.

Following responsible disclosure, Microsoft&nbsp; said &nbsp;it has taken steps to block all certificates to mitigate the threat.

SCARLETEEL was&nbsp; first exposed &nbsp;by the cybersecurity company in February 2023, detailing a sophisticated attack chain that culminated in the theft of proprietary data from AWS infrastructure and the deployment of cryptocurrency miners to profit off the compromised systems' resources illegally.

Beware of Big Head Ransomware: Spreading Through Fake Windows Updates<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/beware-of-big-head-ransomware-spreading.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A developing piece of ransomware called&nbsp; Big Head &nbsp;is being distributed as part of a malvertising campaign that takes the form of bogus Microsoft Windows updates and Word installers. Big Head was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs last month, when it discovered multiple variants of the ransomware that are designed to encrypt files on victims' machines in exchange for a cryptocurrency payment. "One Big Head ransomware variant displays a fake Windows Update, potentially indicating that the ransomware was also distributed as a fake Windows Update," Fortinet researchers said at the time. "One of the variants has a Microsoft Word icon and was likely distributed as counterfeit software." A majority of the Big Head samples have been submitted so far from the U.S., Spain, France, and Turkey. In a new analysis of the .NET-based ransomware, Trend Micro detailed its inner workings, calling out its ability to deploy three encrypted binaries: 1.exe to propag

Apple has released&nbsp; Rapid Security Response &nbsp;updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Safari web browser to&nbsp; address &nbsp;a zero-day flaw that it said has been actively exploited in the wild. The WebKit bug, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-37450 , could allow threat actors to achieve arbitrary code execution when processing specially crafted web content. The iPhone maker said it addressed the issue with improved checks. Credited with discovering and reporting the flaw is an anonymous researcher. As with most cases like this, there are scant details about the nature and the scale of the attacks and the identity of the threat actor behind them. But Apple noted in a terse advisory that it's "aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited." The updates, iOS 16.5.1 (a), iPadOS 16.5.1 (a), macOS Ventura 13.4.1 (a), and Safari 16.5.2, are available for devices running the following operating system versions: iOS 16.5.1 and iPadOS 16.5.1 macOS Ventura 13.4.1 macOS Big

Businesses operating in the Latin American (LATAM) region are the target of a new Windows-based banking trojan called&nbsp; TOITOIN &nbsp;since May 2023. "This sophisticated campaign employs a trojan that follows a multi-staged infection chain, utilizing specially crafted modules throughout each stage," Zscaler researchers Niraj Shivtarkar and Preet Kamal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "These modules are custom designed to carry out malicious activities, such as injecting harmful code into remote processes, circumventing User Account Control via COM Elevation Moniker, and evading detection by Sandboxes through clever techniques like system reboots and parent process checks." The six-stage endeavor has all the hallmarks of a well-crafted attack sequence, beginning with a phishing email containing an embedded link that points to a ZIP archive hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance to evade domain-based detections.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Brick-and-mortar retailers and e-commerce sellers may be locked in a fierce battle for market share, but one area both can agree on is the need to secure their SaaS stack. From communications tools to order management and fulfillment systems, much of today's critical retail software lives in SaaS apps in the cloud. Securing those applications is crucial to ongoing operations, chain management, and business continuity.&nbsp; Breaches in retail send out seismic shockwaves. Ten years later, many still remember one national retailer that had 40 million credit card records stolen. Those attacks have continued. According to&nbsp; Verizon's &nbsp;Data Breach Investigations Report, last year saw 629 cybersecurity incidents in the sector. Clearly, retailers must take concrete steps to secure their SaaS stack.&nbsp; And yet, securing applications is complicated. Retailers tend to have multiple tenants of apps, which leads to confusion over which instances of the application were already secured and whic

The threat actors behind the RomCom RAT have been suspected of phishing attacks targeting the&nbsp; upcoming NATO Summit &nbsp;in Vilnius as well as an identified organization supporting Ukraine abroad. The findings come from the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team, which&nbsp; found &nbsp;two malicious documents submitted from a Hungarian IP address on July 4, 2023. RomCom, also tracked under the names Tropical Scorpius, UNC2596, and Void Rabisu, was recently observed staging cyber attacks against politicians in Ukraine who are working closely with Western countries and a U.S.-based healthcare organization involved with aiding refugees fleeing the war-torn country. Attack chains mounted by the group are geopolitically motivated and have employed spear-phishing emails to point victims to cloned websites hosting trojanized versions of popular software. Targets include militaries, food supply chains, and IT companies. The latest lure documents identified by BlackBerry impersonate Ukrainia

Malicious actors exploited an unknown flaw in Revolut's payment systems to steal more than $20 million of the company's funds in early 2022. The development was&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by the Financial Times, citing multiple unnamed sources with knowledge of the incident. The breach has not been disclosed publicly. The fault stemmed from discrepancies between Revolut's U.S. and European systems, causing funds to be erroneously refunded using its own money when some transactions were declined. The problem was first detected in late 2021. But before it could be closed, the report said organized criminal groups leveraged the loophole by "encouraging individuals to try to make expensive purchases that would go on to be declined." The refunded amounts would then be withdrawn from ATMs. The exact technical details associated with the flaw are currently unclear. About $23 million was stolen in total, with some funds recovered by pursuing those who had withdrawn cash. The mass

Two file management apps on the Google Play Store have been discovered to be spyware, putting the privacy and security of up to 1.5 million Android users at risk. These apps engage in deceptive behaviour and secretly send sensitive user data to malicious servers in China. Pradeo, a leading mobile security company, has uncovered this alarming infiltration. The report shows that both spyware apps, namely File Recovery and Data Recovery (com.spot.music.filedate) with over 1 million installs, and File Manager (com.file.box.master.gkd) with over 500,000 installs, are developed by the same group. These seemingly harmless Android apps use similar malicious tactics and automatically launch when the device reboots without user input. Contrary to what they claim on the Google Play Store, where both apps assure users that no data is collected, Pradeo's analytics engine has found that various personal information is collected without users' knowledge. Stolen data includes contact list

Vishing Goes High-Tech: New 'Letscall' Malware Employs Voice Traffic Routing<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/vishing-goes-high-tech-new-letscall.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have issued a warning about an emerging and advanced form of voice phishing ( vishing ) known as " Letscall ." This technique is currently targeting individuals in South Korea. The criminals behind "Letscall" employ a multi-step attack to deceive victims into downloading malicious apps from a counterfeit Google Play Store website. Once the malicious software is installed, it redirects incoming calls to a call center under the control of the criminals. Trained operators posing as bank employees then extract sensitive information from unsuspecting victims. To facilitate the routing of voice traffic, "Letscall" utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as voice over IP (VOIP) and WebRTC. It also makes use of Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) and Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) protocols, including Google STUN servers, to ensure high-quality phone or video calls and bypass NAT and firewall restrictions.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Progress Software has announced the discovery and patching of a critical SQL injection vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer, popular software used for secure file transfer. In addition, Progress Software has patched two other high-severity vulnerabilities. The identified SQL injection vulnerability, tagged as CVE-2023-36934 , could potentially allow unauthenticated attackers to gain unauthorized access to the MOVEit Transfer database. SQL injection vulnerabilities are a well-known and dangerous security flaw that allows attackers to manipulate databases and run any code they want. Attackers can send specifically designed payloads to certain endpoints of the affected application, which could change or expose sensitive data in the database. The reason CVE-2023-36934 is so critical is that it can be exploited without having to be logged in. This means that even attackers without valid credentials can potentially exploit the vulnerability. However, as of now, there have been no reports of

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mastodon, a popular decentralized social network, has released a security update to fix critical vulnerabilities that could expose millions of users to potential attacks. Mastodon is known for its federated model, consisting of thousands of separate servers called "instances," and it has over 14 million users across more than 20,000 instances. The most critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-36460 , allows hackers to exploit a flaw in the media attachments feature, creating and overwriting files in any location the software could access on an instance. This software vulnerability could be used for DoS and arbitrary remote code execution attacks, posing a significant threat to users and the broader Internet ecosystem. If an attacker gains control over multiple instances, they could cause harm by instructing users to download malicious applications or even bring down the entire Mastodon infrastructure. Fortunately, there is no evidence of this vulnerability being exploited so fa

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
CISOs, security leaders, and SOC teams often struggle with limited visibility into all connections made to their company-owned assets and networks. They are hindered by a lack of open-source intelligence and powerful technology required for proactive, continuous, and effective discovery and protection of their systems, data, and assets. As advanced threat actors constantly search for easily exploitable vulnerabilities around the clock, CISOs are in pursuit of improved methods to reduce threat exposures and safeguard their assets, users, and data from relentless cyber-attacks and the severe consequences of breaches. In response to this need, an emerging solution addressing the most critical priorities at the initial stage of the attack chain has provided security leaders with a new tool to manage their most pressing threat exposures at their origin. Leading analyst firm Gartner Research describes the solution: "By 2026, organizations prioritizing their security investments based

Ransomware attacks are a major problem for organizations everywhere, and the severity of this problem continues to intensify. Recently, Microsoft's Incident Response team investigated the BlackByte 2.0 ransomware attacks and exposed these cyber strikes' terrifying velocity and damaging nature. The findings indicate that hackers can complete the entire attack process, from gaining initial access to causing significant damage, in just five days. They waste no time infiltrating systems, encrypting important data, and demanding a ransom to release it. This shortened timeline poses a significant challenge for organizations trying to protect themselves against these harmful operations. BlackByte ransomware is used in the final stage of the attack, using an 8-digit number key to encrypt the data. To carry out these attacks, hackers use a powerful combination of tools and techniques. The investigation revealed that they take advantage of unpatched Microsoft Exchange Servers—an

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has released its monthly security updates for the Android operating system, addressing 46 new software vulnerabilities. Among these, three vulnerabilities have been identified as actively exploited in targeted attacks. One of the vulnerabilities tracked as CVE-2023-26083 is a memory leak flaw affecting the Arm Mali GPU driver for Bifrost, Avalon, and Valhall chips. This particular vulnerability was exploited in a previous attack that enabled spyware infiltration on Samsung devices in December 2022. This vulnerability was regarded as serious enough to prompt the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue a patching order for federal agencies in April 2023. Another significant vulnerability, identified as CVE-2021-29256, is a high-severity issue that affects specific versions of the Bifrost and Midgard Arm Mali GPU kernel drivers. This flaw permits an unprivileged user to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and escalate privileges to the root lev

Cybersecurity agencies have warned about the emergence of new variants of the TrueBot malware. This enhanced threat is now targeting companies in the U.S. and Canada with the intention of extracting confidential data from infiltrated systems. These sophisticated attacks exploit a critical vulnerability ( CVE-2022-31199 ) in the widely used Netwrix Auditor server and its associated agents. This vulnerability enables unauthorized attackers to execute malicious code with the SYSTEM user's privileges, granting them unrestricted access to compromised systems. The TrueBot malware , linked with cybercriminal collectives Silence and FIN11, is deployed to siphon off data and disseminate ransomware, jeopardising the safety of numerous infiltrated networks. The cybercriminals gain their initial foothold by exploiting the cited vulnerability, then proceed to install TrueBot.

The Iranian nation-state actor known as TA453 has been linked to a new set of spear-phishing attacks that infect both Windows and macOS operating systems with malware. "TA453 eventually used a variety of cloud hosting providers to deliver a novel infection chain that deploys the newly identified PowerShell backdoor GorjolEcho," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "When given the opportunity, TA453 ported its malware and attempted to launch an Apple flavored infection chain dubbed NokNok. TA453 also employed&nbsp; multi-persona impersonation &nbsp;in its unending espionage quest." TA453, also known by the names APT35, Charming Kitten, Mint Sandstorm, and Yellow Garuda, is a threat group linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) that has been active since at least 2011. Most recently, Volexity highlighted the adversary's use of an updated version of a Powershell implant called&nbsp; CharmPower &nbsp;(aka GhostEcho or POWERSTAR). In the attack sequence discove

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a newly identified security flaw in the Linux kernel that could allow a user to gain elevated privileges on a target host. Dubbed&nbsp; StackRot &nbsp;( CVE-2023-3269 , CVSS score: 7.8), the flaw impacts Linux versions 6.1 through 6.4. There is no evidence that the shortcoming has been exploited in the wild to date. "As StackRot is a Linux kernel vulnerability found in the memory management subsystem, it affects almost all kernel configurations and requires minimal capabilities to trigger," Peking University security researcher Ruihan Li&nbsp; said . "However, it should be noted that maple nodes are freed using RCU callbacks, delaying the actual memory deallocation until after the RCU grace period. Consequently, exploiting this vulnerability is considered challenging." Following&nbsp; responsible disclosure &nbsp;on June 15, 2023, it has been&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;in stable versions 6.1.37, 6.3.11, and 6.4.1 as of July 1, 2023, after a two-week effort led by Linus Tor

As technology advances and organizations become more reliant on data, the risks associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks also increase. The introduction of data privacy laws, such as the GDPR, has made it mandatory for organizations to disclose breaches of personal data to those affected. As such, it has become essential for businesses to protect themselves from the financial and reputational costs of cyber incidents. One solution to help organizations protect themselves is cyber insurance, despite the rising costs of cyber insurance, where the average&nbsp; price in the U.S. rose 79% &nbsp;in the second quarter of 2022. Also, with strict eligibility requirements that have emerged in response to risk and sharp spikes in successful breaches during and post-COVID-19, cyber insurance remains essential for organizations to protect sensitive customer information and their own data from falling into the wrong hands.

Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed an attack infrastructure that's being used as part of a "potentially massive campaign" against cloud-native environments.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A sophisticated stealer-as-a-ransomware threat dubbed&nbsp; RedEnergy &nbsp;has been spotted in the wild targeting energy utilities, oil, gas, telecom, and machinery sectors in Brazil and the Philippines through their LinkedIn pages. The malware "possesses the ability to steal information from various browsers, enabling the exfiltration of sensitive data, while also incorporating different modules for carrying out ransomware activities," Zscaler researchers Shatak Jain and Gurkirat Singh&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a recent analysis. The goal, the researchers noted, is to couple data theft with encryption with the goal of inflicting maximum damage to the victims. The starting point for the multi-stage attack is a&nbsp; FakeUpdates &nbsp;(aka SocGholish) campaign that tricks users into downloading JavaScript-based malware under the guise of web browser updates. What makes it novel is the use of reputable LinkedIn pages to target victims, redirecting users clicking on the website URLs to a bogus landing page

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Secrets are meant to be hidden or, at the very least, only known to a specific and limited set of individuals (or systems). Otherwise, they aren't really secrets. In personal life, a secret revealed can damage relationships, lead to social stigma, or, at the very least, be embarrassing. In a developer's or application security engineer's professional life, the consequences of exposing secrets can lead to breaches of security, data leaks, and, well, also be embarrassing. And while there are tools available for detecting source code and code repositories, there are few options for identifying secrets in plain text, documents, emails, chat logs, content management systems, and more. What Are Secrets? In the context of applications, secrets are sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, cryptographic keys, and other confidential data that an application needs to function but should not be exposed to unauthorized users. Secrets are typically stored securely and access

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The npm registry for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment is susceptible to what's called a&nbsp; manifest confusion &nbsp;attack that could potentially allow threat actors to conceal malware in project dependencies or perform arbitrary script execution during installation. "A npm package's manifest is published independently from its tarball," Darcy Clarke, a former GitHub and npm engineering manager,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published last week. "Manifests are never fully validated against the tarball's contents." "The ecosystem has broadly assumed the contents of the manifest and tarball are consistent," Clarke added. The problem, at its core, stems from the fact that the manifest and package metadata are decoupled and that they are never cross-referenced against one another, thereby leading to unexpected behavior and misuse when there is a mismatch. As a result, a threat actor could exploit this loophole to publish a module with a ma

Instagram Threads, the upcoming Twitter competitor from Meta, will not be launched in the European Union due to privacy concerns, according to Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC). The development was&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by the Irish Independent, which said the watchdog has been in contact with the social media giant about the new product and confirmed the release won't extend to the E.U. "at this point." Threads &nbsp;is Meta's answer to Twitter that's set for launch on July 6, 2023. It's billed as a "text-based conversation app" that allows Instagram users to "discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what'll be trending tomorrow." It also enables users to follow the same accounts they already follow on Instagram. A listing for the app has already appeared in the&nbsp; Apple App Store &nbsp;and&nbsp; Google Play Store , although it's yet to be available for download.

The Swedish data protection watchdog has warned companies against using Google Analytics due to risks posed by U.S. government surveillance, following similar moves by&nbsp; Austria, France , and&nbsp; Italy &nbsp;last year. The development comes in the aftermath of an audit initiated by the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) against four companies CDON, Coop, Dagens Industri, and Tele2. "In its audits, IMY considers that the data transferred to the U.S. via Google's statistics tool is personal data because the data can be linked with other unique data that is transferred," IMY&nbsp; said . "The authority also concludes that the technical security measures that the companies have taken are not sufficient to ensure a level of protection that essentially corresponds to that guaranteed within the EU/EEA." The data protection authority also fined $1.1 million for Swedish telecom service provider Tele2 and less than $30,000 for local online marketplace CDON failing to

An e-crime actor of Mexican provenance has been linked to an Android mobile malware campaign targeting financial institutions globally, but with a specific focus on Spanish and Chilean banks, from June 2021 to April 2023. The activity is being attributed to an actor codenamed&nbsp; Neo_Net , according to security researcher Pol Thill. The findings were published by SentinelOne following a Malware Research Challenge in collaboration with vx-underground. "Despite using relatively unsophisticated tools, Neo_Net has achieved a high success rate by tailoring their infrastructure to specific targets, resulting in the theft of over 350,000 EUR from victims' bank accounts and compromising Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of thousands of victims," Thill&nbsp; said .

No less than 330,000 FortiGate firewalls are still unpatched and vulnerable to CVE-2023-27997, a critical security flaw affecting Fortinet devices that has come under active exploitation in the wild. Cybersecurity firm Bishop Fox, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;published last week, said that out of nearly 490,000 Fortinet SSL-VPN interfaces exposed on the internet, about 69 percent remain unpatched. CVE-2023-27997 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), also called XORtigate, is a critical vulnerability impacting Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy SSL-VPN appliances that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands via specifically crafted requests. Patches were released by Fortinet last month in versions 6.0.17, 6.2.15, 6.4.13, 7.0.12, and 7.2.5, although the company&nbsp; acknowledged &nbsp;that the flaw may have been "exploited in a limited number of cases" in attacks targeting government, manufacturing, and critical infrastructure sectors.

A Chinese nation-state group has been observed targeting Foreign Affairs ministries and embassies in Europe using&nbsp; HTML smuggling techniques &nbsp;to deliver the PlugX remote access trojan on compromised systems. Cybersecurity firm Check Point said the activity, dubbed&nbsp; SmugX , has been ongoing since at least December 2022. "The campaign uses new delivery methods to deploy (most notably – HTML Smuggling) a new variant of PlugX, an implant commonly associated with a wide variety of Chinese threat actors," Check Point&nbsp; said . "Although the payload itself remains similar to the one found in older PlugX variants, its delivery methods result in low detection rates, which until recently helped the campaign fly under the radar." The exact identity of the threat actor behind the operation is a little hazy, although existing clues point in the direction of&nbsp; Mustang Panda , which also shares overlaps with clusters tracked as Earth Preta, RedDelta, and Check Point's own d

"From critical login credentials to the valuable record of browsing history and meticulously curated bookmarks, no digital artifact is safe. Even crypto wallet extensions, password managers, and 2FA extensions are vulnerable." Despite the similarity in features, Meduza boasts of a "crafty" operational design that eschews the use of obfuscation techniques and promptly terminates its execution on compromised hosts should a connection to the attacker's server fail.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the&nbsp; BlackCat ransomware &nbsp;have been observed employing malvertising tricks to distribute rogue installers of the WinSCP file transfer application. "Malicious actors used malvertising to distribute a piece of malware via cloned webpages of legitimate organizations," Trend Micro researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. "In this case, the distribution involved a webpage of the well-known application WinSCP, an open-source Windows application for file transfer." Malvertising &nbsp; refers &nbsp;to the use of&nbsp; SEO poisoning techniques &nbsp;to spread malware via online advertising. It typically involves hijacking a chosen set of keywords to display bogus ads on Bing and Google search results pages with the goal of redirecting unsuspecting users to sketchy pages.

As many as 200,000 WordPress websites are at risk of ongoing attacks exploiting a critical unpatched security vulnerability in the Ultimate Member plugin. The flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-3460 (CVSS score: 9.8), impacts all versions of the Ultimate Member plugin, including the latest version (2.6.6) that was released on June 29, 2023. Ultimate Member is a&nbsp; popular plugin &nbsp;that facilitates the creation of user-profiles and communities on WordPress sites. It also provides account management features. "This is a very serious issue: unauthenticated attackers may exploit this vulnerability to create new user accounts with administrative privileges, giving them the power to take complete control of affected sites," WordPress security firm WPScan&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert. Although details about the flaw have been withheld due to active abuse, it stems from an inadequate blocklist logic put in place to alter the wp_capabilities user meta value of a new user to that of an administrator a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have pulled back the curtain on an updated version of an Apple macOS malware called RustBucket that comes with improved&nbsp;capabilities to establish persistence and avoid detection by security software. "This variant of RustBucket, a malware family that targets macOS systems, adds persistence capabilities not previously observed," Elastic Security Labs researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week, adding it's "leveraging a dynamic network infrastructure methodology for command-and-control." RustBucket is the work of a North Korean threat actor known as BlueNoroff, which is part of a larger intrusion set tracked under the name&nbsp; Lazarus Group , an elite hacking unit supervised by the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), the country's primary intelligence agency. The malware came to light in April 2023, when Jamf Threat Labs&nbsp; described &nbsp;it as an AppleScript-based backdoor capable of retrieving a second-stage payload from a remote server. Elas

Charming Kitten, the nation-state actor affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has been attributed to a bespoke spear-phishing campaign that delivers an updated version of a fully-featured PowerShell backdoor called POWERSTAR. "There have been improved operational security measures placed in the malware to make it more difficult to analyze and collect intelligence," Volexity researchers Ankur Saini and Charlie Gardner said in a report published this week. The threat actor is something of an expert when it comes to employing social engineering to lure targets, often crafting tailored fake personas on social media platforms and engaging in sustained conversations to build rapport before sending a malicious link. It's also tracked under the names APT35, Cobalt Illusion, Mint Sandstorm (formerly Phosphorus), and Yellow Garuda.

Meta's WhatsApp has rolled out updates to its proxy feature, allowing more flexibility in the kind of content that can be shared in conversations. This includes the ability to send and receive images, voice notes, files, stickers and GIFs, WhatsApp told The Hacker News. The new features were&nbsp; first reported &nbsp;by BBC Persian. Some of the other improvements include streamlined steps to simplify the setup process as well as the introduction of shareable links to "share functioning/valid proxy addresses to their contacts for easy and automatic installation." Support for&nbsp; proxy servers &nbsp;was officially launched by the messaging service&nbsp; earlier this January , thereby helping users circumvent government-imposed censorship and internet shutdowns and obtain indirect access to WhatsApp. The company has also made available a&nbsp; reference implementation &nbsp;for setting up a proxy server with ports 80, 443 or 5222 available and domain name that points to the server's IP address. &amp;

Cybercriminals Hijacking Vulnerable SSH Servers in New Proxyjacking Campaign<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/cybercriminals-hijacking-vulnerable-ssh.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An active financially motivated campaign is targeting vulnerable SSH servers to covertly ensnare them into a proxy network. "This is an active campaign in which the attacker leverages SSH for remote access, running malicious scripts that stealthily enlist victim servers into a peer-to-peer (P2P) proxy network, such as Peer2Profit or Honeygain," Akamai researcher Allen West said in a Thursday report. Unlike cryptojacking, in which a compromised system's resources are used to illicitly mine cryptocurrency, proxyjacking offers the ability for threat actors to leverage the victim's unused bandwidth to covertly run different services as a P2P node. This offers two-fold benefits: It not only enables the attacker to monetize the extra bandwidth with a significantly reduced resource load that would be necessary to carry out cryptojacking, it also reduces the chances of discovery. "It is a stealthier alternative to cryptojacking and has serious implications that ca

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian state-sponsored group dubbed MuddyWater has been attributed to a previously unseen command-and-control (C2) framework called&nbsp; PhonyC2 &nbsp;that's been put to use by the actor since 2021. Evidence shows that the custom made, actively developed framework has been leveraged in the&nbsp; February 2023 attack on Technion , an Israeli research institute, cybersecurity firm Deep Instinct said in a report shared with The Hacker News. What's more, additional links have been unearthed between the Python 3-based program and other attacks carried out by MuddyWater, including the&nbsp; ongoing exploitation of PaperCut servers . "It is structurally and functionally similar to&nbsp; MuddyC3 , a previous MuddyWater&nbsp; custom C2 framework &nbsp;that was written in Python 2," security researcher Simon Kenin said. "MuddyWater is continuously updating the PhonyC2 framework and changing TTPs to avoid detection." MuddyWater, also known as Mango Sandstorm (previously Mercury), is a cyber

The malware "represents a significant shift as it incorporates the malicious components directly within the Flutter code," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Axelle Apvrille&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. Fluhorse was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Check Point in early May 2023, detailing its attacks on users located in East Asia through rogue apps masquerading as ETC and VPBank Neo, which are popular in Taiwan and Vietnam. The initial intrusion vector for the malware is phishing. The ultimate goal of the app is to steal credentials, credit card details, and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes received as SMS to a remote server under the control of the threat actors. The latest findings from Fortinet, which reverse-engineered a&nbsp; Fluhorse sample &nbsp;uploaded to VirusTotal on June 11, 2023, suggest that the malware has evolved, incorporating additional sophistication b

Cyber threat intelligence is an effective weapon in the ongoing battle to protect digital assets and infrastructure - especially when combined with AI. But AI is only as good as the data feeding it. Access to unique, underground sources is key. Threat Intelligence offers tremendous value to people and companies. At the same time, its ability to address organizations' cybersecurity needs and the benefits it offers vary by company, industry, and other factors. A common challenge with cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is that the data it produces can be vast and overwhelming, creating confusion and inefficiencies among security teams' threat exposure management efforts. Additionally, organizations have different levels of security maturity, which can make access to and understanding of CTI data difficult. Enter generative AI. Many cybersecurity companies – and more specifically, threat intelligence companies – are bringing generative AI to market to simplify threat intelligence a

The North Korea-aligned threat actor known as Andariel leveraged a previously undocumented malware called EarlyRat in attacks exploiting the Log4j Log4Shell vulnerability last year. "Andariel infects machines by executing a Log4j exploit, which, in turn, downloads further malware from the command-and-control (C2) server," Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. Also called Silent Chollima and Stonefly, Andariel is associated with North Korea's Lab 110, a primary hacking unit that also houses&nbsp; APT38 &nbsp;(aka BlueNoroff ) and other subordinate elements collectively tracked under the umbrella name&nbsp; Lazarus Group .&nbsp; The threat actor, besides conducting espionage attacks against foreign government and military entities that are of strategic interest, is known to&nbsp; carry out cyber crime &nbsp;as an extra source of income to the sanctions-hit nation.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical security flaw has been disclosed in miniOrange's&nbsp; Social Login and Register plugin &nbsp;for WordPress that could enable a malicious actor to log in as any user-provided information about email address is already known. Tracked as CVE-2023-2982 (CVSS score: 9.8), the authentication bypass flaw impacts all versions of the plugin, including and prior to 7.6.4. It was addressed on June 14, 2023, with the release of version 7.6.5 following responsible disclosure on June 2, 2023. "The vulnerability makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to any account on a site including accounts used to administer the site, if the attacker knows, or can find, the associated email address," Wordfence researcher István Márton&nbsp; said . The issue is rooted in the fact that the encryption key used to secure the information during login using social media accounts is hard-coded, thus leading to a scenario where attackers could create a valid request with a properl

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Windows-based information stealer called&nbsp; ThirdEye &nbsp;has been discovered in the wild with capabilities to harvest sensitive data from infected hosts. Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, which&nbsp; made the discovery , said it found the malware in an executable that masqueraded as a&nbsp; PDF file &nbsp;with a Russian name "CMK Правила оформления больничных листов.pdf.exe," which translates to "CMK Rules for issuing sick leaves.pdf.exe." The arrival vector for the malware is presently unknown, although the nature of the lure points to it being used in a phishing campaign. The very&nbsp; first ThirdEye sample &nbsp;was uploaded to VirusTotal on April 4, 2023, with relatively fewer features. The evolving stealer, like&nbsp; other malware families &nbsp;of its kind, is equipped to gather system metadata, including BIOS release date and vendor, total/free disk space on the C drive, currently running processes, register usernames, and volume information.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Drones that don't have any known security weaknesses could be the target of electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) attacks, potentially enabling a threat actor to achieve arbitrary code execution and compromise their functionality and safety. The research comes from IOActive, which&nbsp; found &nbsp;that it is "feasible to compromise the targeted device by injecting a specific EM glitch at the right time during a firmware update." "This would allow an attacker to gain code execution on the main processor, gaining access to the Android OS that implements the core functionality of the drone," Gabriel Gonzalez, director of hardware security at the company, said in a report published this month.

5 Things CISOs Need to Know About Securing OT Environments<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/5-things-cisos-need-to-know-about.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For too long the cybersecurity world focused exclusively on information technology (IT), leaving operational technology (OT) to fend for itself. Traditionally, few industrial enterprises had dedicated cybersecurity leaders. Any security decisions that arose fell to the plant and factory managers, who are highly skilled technical experts in other areas but often lack cybersecurity training or knowledge. In more recent years, an uptick in cyberattacks against industrial facilities and the trend of IT/OT convergence driven by Industry 4.0 have highlighted the vacuum of ownership around OT security.&nbsp; According to a new Fortinet report , most organizations are looking to Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) to solve the problem. Fortunately, CISOs are no strangers to change or difficult challenges. The position itself is less than 20 years old, yet in those two decades CISOs have navigated some of the most disruptive cybersecurity events that were truly watershed moments in techno

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A ransomware threat called 8Base that has been operating under the radar for over a year has been attributed to a "massive spike in activity" in May and June 2023. "The group utilizes encryption paired with 'name-and-shame' techniques to compel their victims to pay their ransoms," VMware Carbon Black researchers Deborah Snyder and Fae Carlisle&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "8Base has an opportunistic pattern of compromise with recent victims spanning across varied industries." 8Base, according to statistics gathered by&nbsp; Malwarebytes &nbsp;and&nbsp; NCC Group , has been linked to 67 attacks as of May 2023, with about 50% of the victims&nbsp; operating &nbsp;in the business services, manufacturing, and construction sectors. A majority of the targeted companies are located in the U.S. and Brazil. With very little known about the operators of the ransomware, its origins remain something of a cipher.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Gentoo Soko that could lead to remote code execution (RCE) on vulnerable systems. "These SQL injections happened despite the use of an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library and prepared statements," SonarSource researcher Thomas Chauchefoin&nbsp; said , adding they could result in RCE on Soko because of a "misconfiguration of the database." The&nbsp; two &nbsp; issues , which were discovered in the search feature of Soko, have been collectively tracked as CVE-2023-28424 (CVSS score: 9.1). They were addressed within 24 hours of responsible disclosure on March 17, 2023. Soko is a Go software module that powers&nbsp; packages.gentoo.org , offering users an easy way to search through different Portage packages that are available for Gentoo Linux distribution. But the shortcomings identified in the service meant that it could have been possible for a malicious actor to&nbsp; inject specially crafted code , resulting in the expo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new process injection technique dubbed Mockingjay could be exploited by threat actors to bypass security solutions to execute malicious code on compromised systems. "The injection is executed without space allocation, setting permissions or even starting a thread," Security Joes researchers Thiago Peixoto, Felipe Duarte, and Ido Naor&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The uniqueness of this technique is that it requires a vulnerable DLL and copying code to the right section." Process injection is an&nbsp; attack method &nbsp;that allows adversaries to inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses and elevate privileges. In doing so, it could allow for the execution of arbitrary code in the memory space of a separate live process. Some of the well-known process injection techniques include dynamic link library (DLL) injection, portable executable injection, thread execution hijacking, process hollowing, and process doppelgänging, amon

New Ongoing Campaign Targets npm Ecosystem with Unique Execution Chain<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-ongoing-campaign-targets-npm.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new ongoing campaign aimed at the npm&nbsp;ecosystem that leverages a unique execution chain to deliver an unknown payload to targeted systems. "The packages in question seem to be published in pairs, each pair working in unison to fetch additional resources which are subsequently decoded and/or executed," software supply chain security firm Phylum&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report released last week. To that end, the order in which the pair of packages are installed is paramount to pulling off a successful attack, as the first of the two modules are designed to store locally a token retrieved from a remote server. The campaign was first discovered on June 11, 2023. The second package subsequently passes this token as a parameter alongside the operating system type to an&nbsp; HTTP GET request &nbsp;to acquire a second script from the remote server. A successful execution returns a Base64-encoded string that is immediately executed but only if that string is

Beyond Asset Discovery: How Attack Surface Management Prioritizes Vulnerability Remediation<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/beyond-asset-discovery-how-attack.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the business environment becomes increasingly connected, organizations' attack surfaces continue to expand, making it challenging to map and secure both known and unknown assets. In particular, unknown assets present security challenges related to shadow IT, misconfigurations, ineffective scan coverage, among others. Given attack surface sprawl and evolving threats, many organizations are embracing&nbsp; attack surface management (ASM) &nbsp;tools to discover and address critical exposures. Asset discovery is an important capability to have, and one that's helping to drive the adoption of attack surface management tools and services. That said, asset discovery is only one aspect of effective attack surface management. Making the attack surface as impenetrable as possible takes offensive security that goes far beyond the discovery phase. Why Asset Discovery Isn't Enough&nbsp; Given the complexity and ever-expanding scale of the digital infrastructure at most companies, cataloging all the known

A new Android malware campaign has been observed pushing the Anatsa banking trojan to target banking customers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria, and Switzerland since the start of March 2023. "The actors behind Anatsa aim to steal credentials used to authorize customers in mobile banking applications and perform Device-Takeover Fraud (DTO) to initiate fraudulent transactions," ThreatFabric&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published Monday. The Dutch cybersecurity company said Anatsa-infected Google Play Store&nbsp; dropper apps &nbsp;have accrued over 30,000 installations to date, indicating that the official app storefront has become an effective distribution vector for the malware. Anatsa, also known by the name TeaBot and Toddler, first&nbsp; emerged &nbsp;in&nbsp; early 2021 , and has been observed&nbsp; masquerading &nbsp;as&nbsp; seemingly innocuous utility apps &nbsp;like PDF readers, QR code scanners, and two-factor authentication (2FA) apps on Google Play to siphon users' credentials.

Researchers Find Way to Recover Cryptographic Keys by Analyzing LED Flickers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/researchers-find-way-to-recover.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's an ingenious&nbsp; side-channel attack , a group of academics has found that it's possible to recover secret keys from a device by analyzing video footage of its power LED. "Cryptographic computations performed by the CPU change the power consumption of the device which affects the brightness of the device's power LED," researchers from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Cornell University&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a study. By taking advantage of this observation, it's possible for threat actors to leverage video camera devices such as an iPhone 13 or an internet-connected surveillance camera to extract the cryptographic keys from a smart card reader­. Specifically, video-based cryptanalysis is accomplished by obtaining video footage of rapid changes in an LED's brightness and exploiting the video camera's&nbsp; rolling shutter &nbsp;effect to capture the physical emanations. "This is caused by the fact that the power LED is connected directly to the pow

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown cryptocurrency exchange located in Japan was the target of a new attack earlier this month to deploy an Apple macOS backdoor called JokerSpy. Elastic Security Labs, which is monitoring the intrusion set under the name&nbsp; REF9134 ,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the attack led to the installation of Swiftbelt, a Swift-based enumeration tool inspired by an open-source utility called&nbsp; SeatBelt . JokerSky was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Bitdefender last week, describing it as a sophisticated toolkit designed to breach macOS machines. Very little is known about the threat actor behind the operation other than the fact that the attacks leverage a set of programs written in Python and Swift that come with capabilities to gather data and execute arbitrary commands on compromised hosts. A primary component of the toolkit is a self-signed multi-architecture binary known as xcc that's engineered to check for FullDiskAccess and ScreenRecording permissions.

Security and IT teams are routinely forced to adopt software before fully understanding the security risks. And AI tools are no exception. Employees and business leaders alike are flocking to generative AI software and similar programs, often unaware of the major SaaS security vulnerabilities they're introducing into the enterprise. A February 2023&nbsp; generative AI survey of 1,000 executives &nbsp;revealed that 49% of respondents use ChatGPT now, and 30% plan to tap into the ubiquitous generative AI tool soon. Ninety-nine percent of those using ChatGPT claimed some form of cost-savings, and 25% attested to reducing expenses by $75,000 or more. As the researchers conducted this survey a mere three months after ChatGPT's general availability, today's ChatGPT and AI tool usage is undoubtedly higher.&nbsp; Security and risk teams are already overwhelmed protecting their SaaS estate (which has now become the operating system of business) from common vulnerabilities such as misconfigurati

Microsoft Warns of Widescale Credential Stealing Attacks by Russian Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/microsoft-warns-of-widescale-credential.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has disclosed that it's detected a spike in credential-stealing attacks conducted by the Russian state-affiliated hacker group known as Midnight Blizzard. The intrusions, which made use of residential proxy services to obfuscate the source IP address of the attacks, target governments, IT service providers, NGOs, defense, and critical manufacturing sectors, the tech giant's threat intelligence team said. Midnight Blizzard, formerly known as Nobelium , is also tracked under the monikers APT29, Cozy Bear, Iron Hemlock, and The Dukes. The&nbsp; group , which drew worldwide attention for the SolarWinds supply chain compromise in December 2020, has&nbsp; continued &nbsp;to rely on&nbsp; unseen tooling &nbsp;in its targeted attacks aimed at foreign ministries and diplomatic entities. It's a sign of how determined they are to keep their operations up and running despite being exposed, which makes them a particularly formidable actor in the espionage area.

The newly discovered Chinese nation-state actor known as Volt Typhoon has been observed to be active in the wild since at least mid-2020, with the hacking crew linked to never-before-seen tradecraft to retain remote access to targets of interest. The findings come from CrowdStrike, which is tracking the adversary under the name&nbsp; Vanguard Panda . "The adversary consistently employed ManageEngine Self-service Plus exploits to gain initial access, followed by custom web shells for persistent access, and living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques for lateral movement," the cybersecurity company&nbsp; said . Volt Typhoon, as known as Bronze Silhouette, is a&nbsp; cyber espionage group &nbsp;from China that's been linked to network intrusion operations against the U.S government, defense, and other critical infrastructure organizations.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has&nbsp; added &nbsp;a batch of six flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. This comprises three vulnerabilities that Apple patched this week ( CVE-2023-32434, CVE-2023-32435, and CVE-2023-32439 ), two flaws in VMware ( CVE-2023-20867 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-20887 ), and one shortcoming impacting Zyxel devices ( CVE-2023-27992 ). CVE-2023-32434 and CVE-2023-32435, both of which allow code execution, are said to have been exploited as zero-days to deploy spyware as part of a years-long cyber espionage campaign that commenced in 2019. Dubbed Operation Triangulation, the activity culminates in the deployment of&nbsp; TriangleDB &nbsp;that's designed to harvest a wide range of information from compromised devices, such as creating, modifying, removing, and stealing files, listing and terminating processes, gathering credentials from iCloud Keychain, and tracking a user's location.

A U.K. citizen who took part in the massive July 2020 hack of Twitter has been sentenced to five years in prison in the U.S. Joseph James O'Connor (aka PlugwalkJoe), 24, was awarded the sentence on Friday in the Southern District of New York, a little over a month&nbsp; after &nbsp;he&nbsp; pleaded guilty &nbsp;to the criminal schemes. He was&nbsp; arrested &nbsp;in Spain in July 2021. The infamous Twitter breach allowed the defendant and his co-conspirators to obtain unauthorized access to backend tools used by Twitter, abusing them to hijack 130 popular accounts to perpetrate a crypto scam that netted them about $120,000 in illegal profits. "In other instances, the co-conspirators sold access to Twitter accounts to others," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)&nbsp; said . "O'Connor communicated with others regarding purchasing unauthorized access to a variety of Twitter accounts, including accounts associated with public figures around the world."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor known as&nbsp; Muddled Libra &nbsp;is targeting the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry with persistent attacks that leverage advanced social engineering ploys to gain initial access. "The attack style defining Muddled Libra appeared on the cybersecurity radar in late 2022 with the release of the 0ktapus phishing kit, which offered a prebuilt hosting framework and bundled templates," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. Libra is the&nbsp; designation &nbsp;given by the cybersecurity company for cybercrime groups. The "muddled" moniker for the threat actor stems from the prevailing ambiguity with regards to the use of the 0ktapus framework. 0ktapus , also known as Scatter Swine, refers to an intrusion set that first came to light in August 2022 in connection with smishing attacks against over 100 organizations, including Twilio and Cloudflare.

The case for browser fingerprinting: personalizing user experience, improving fraud detection, and optimizing login security Have you ever heard of browser fingerprinting? You should! It's an online user identification technique that collects information about a visitor's web browser and its configuration preferences to associate individual browsing sessions with a single website visitor.&nbsp; With browser fingerprinting, many pieces of data can be collected about a user's web browser and device, such as screen resolution, location, language, and operating system. When you stitch these pieces together, they reveal a unique combination of information that forms every user's visitor ID or "digital fingerprint." Websites can use the visitor ID in various ways, including personalizing the user's experience, improving fraud detection, and optimizing login security.

Powerful JavaScript Dropper PindOS Distributes Bumblebee and IcedID Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/powerful-javascript-dropper-pindos.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new strain of JavaScript dropper has been observed delivering next-stage payloads like Bumblebee and IcedID. Cybersecurity firm Deep Instinct is tracking the malware as&nbsp; PindOS , which contains the name in its " User-Agent " string. Both&nbsp; Bumblebee &nbsp;and IcedID serve as loaders, acting as a vector for other malware on compromised hosts, including ransomware. A recent report from Proofpoint&nbsp; highlighted &nbsp;IcedID's abandoning of banking fraud features to solely focus on malware delivery.

NSA Releases Guide to Combat Powerful BlackLotus Bootkit Targeting Windows Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/nsa-releases-guide-to-combat-powerful.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) on Thursday released guidance to help organizations detect and prevent infections of a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) bootkit called&nbsp; BlackLotus . To that end, the agency is&nbsp; recommending &nbsp;that "infrastructure owners take action by hardening user executable policies and monitoring the integrity of the boot partition." BlackLotus is an&nbsp; advanced &nbsp;crimeware solution that was first spotlighted in October 2022 by Kaspersky. A UEFI bootkit capable of bypassing Windows Secure Boot protections, samples of the malware have since emerged in the wild. This is accomplished by taking advantage of a known Windows flaw called Baton Drop ( CVE-2022-21894 , CVSS score: 4.4) discovered in vulnerable&nbsp; boot loaders &nbsp;not added into the&nbsp; Secure Boot DBX revocation list . The vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft in January 2022. This loophole could be exploited by threat actors to replace fully patched boot loaders with vulnerable v

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Internet-facing Linux systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being targeted as part of a new campaign designed to illicitly mine cryptocurrency. "The threat actors behind the attack use a backdoor that deploys a wide array of tools and components such as rootkits and an IRC bot to steal device resources for mining operations," Microsoft threat intelligence researcher Rotem Sde-Or&nbsp; said . "The backdoor also installs a patched version of OpenSSH on affected devices, allowing threat actors to hijack SSH credentials, move laterally within the network, and conceal malicious SSH connections." To pull off the scheme, misconfigured Linux hosts are brute-forced to gain initial access, following which the threat actors move to disable shell history and fetch a trojanized version of OpenSSH from a remote server. The rogue OpenSSH package is configured to install and launch the backdoor, a shell script that allows the attackers to distribute additional payloads a

A new phishing campaign codenamed&nbsp; MULTI#STORM &nbsp;has set its sights on India and the U.S. by leveraging JavaScript files to deliver remote access trojans on compromised systems. "The attack chain ends with the victim machine infected with multiple unique RAT (remote access trojan) malware instances, such as Warzone RAT and Quasar RAT," Securonix researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov&nbsp; said . "Both are used for command-and-control during different stages of the infection chain." The multi-stage attack chain commences when an email recipient clicks the embedded link pointing to a password-protected ZIP file ("REQUEST.zip") hosted on Microsoft OneDrive with the password "12345." Extracting the archive file reveals a heavily obfuscated JavaScript file ("REQUEST.js") that, when double clicked, activates the infection by executing two PowerShell commands that are responsible for retrieving two separate payloads from OneDri

Millions of software repositories on GitHub are likely vulnerable to an attack called RepoJacking , a new study has revealed. This includes repositories from organizations such as Google, Lyft, and several others, Massachusetts-based cloud-native security firm Aqua&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report. The supply chain vulnerability, also known as dependency repository hijacking, is a&nbsp; class of attacks &nbsp;that makes it possible to take over&nbsp;retired organization or user names and publish trojanized versions of repositories to run malicious code. "When a repository owner changes their username, a link is created between the old name and the new name for anyone who downloads dependencies from the old repository," researchers Ilay Goldman and Yakir Kadkoda said. "However, it is possible for anyone to create the old username and break this link." Alternatively, a similar scenario could arise when a repository ownership is transferred to another user and the original account

The cybersecurity company, which found evidence of USB malware infections in Myanmar, South Korea, Great Britain, India, and Russia, said the findings are the result of a cyber incident that it investigated at an unnamed European hospital in early 2023. The probe found that the entity was not directly targeted by the adversary but rather suffered a breach via an employee's USB drive, which became infected when it was plugged into a colleague's computer at a conference in Asia.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Why Data Exfiltration Detection is Paramount? The world is witnessing an exponential rise in ransomware and data theft employed to extort companies. At the same time, the industry faces numerous critical vulnerabilities in database software and company websites. This evolution paints a dire picture of data exposure and exfiltration that every security leader and team is grappling with. This article highlights this challenge and expounds on the benefits that Machine Learning algorithms and Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) approaches bring to the table. Data exfiltration often serves as the final act of a cyberattack, making it the last window of opportunity to detect the breach before the data is made public or is used for other sinister activities, such as espionage. However, data leakage isn't only an aftermath of cyberattacks, it can also be a consequence of human error. While prevention of data exfiltration through security controls is ideal, the escalating complexity a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical security flaw has been disclosed in the WordPress "Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce" plugin that's&nbsp; installed &nbsp;on more than 30,000 websites. "This vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker to gain access to the accounts of users who have abandoned their carts, who are typically customers but can extend to other high-level users when the right conditions are met," Defiant's Wordfence&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. Tracked as CVE-2023-2986, the shortcoming has been rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS scoring system. It impacts all versions of the plugin, including and prior to versions 5.14.2. The problem, at its core, is a case of authentication bypass that arises as a result of insufficient encryption protections that are applied when customers are notified when they have abandoned their shopping carts on e-commerce sites without completing the purchase. Specifically, the encryption key is hard-coded in the plugin, thereby allowing

Apple on Wednesday released a&nbsp; slew of updates &nbsp;for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and Safari browser to address a set of flaws it said were actively exploited in the wild. This includes a pair of zero-days that have been weaponized in a mobile surveillance campaign called&nbsp; Operation Triangulation &nbsp;that has been active since 2019. The exact threat actor behind the activity is not known. CVE-2023-32434 &nbsp;- An integer overflow vulnerability in the Kernel that could be exploited by a malicious app to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. CVE-2023-32435 &nbsp;- A memory corruption vulnerability in WebKit that could lead to arbitrary code execution when processing specially crafted web content. The iPhone maker said it's aware that the two issues "may have been actively exploited against versions of iOS released before iOS 15.7," crediting Kaspersky researchers Georgy Kucherin, Leonid Bezvershenko, and Boris Larin for reporting them.

The North Korean threat actor known as ScarCruft has been observed using an information-stealing malware with previous undocumented wiretapping features as well as a backdoor developed using Golang that exploits the Ably real-time messaging service. "The threat actor sent their commands through the Golang backdoor that is using the Ably service," the AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC) said in a technical report. "The API key value required for command communication was saved in a GitHub repository." ScarCruft is a state-sponsored outfit with links to North Korea's Ministry of State Security (MSS). It's known to be active since at least 2012. Attack chains mounted by the group entail the use of spear-phishing lures to deliver RokRAT , although it has leveraged a wide range of other custom tools to harvest sensitive information.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More details have emerged about the spyware implant that's delivered to iOS devices as part of a campaign called Operation Triangulation. Kaspersky, which&nbsp; discovered the operation &nbsp;after becoming one of the targets at the start of the year, said the malware has a lifespan of 30 days, after which it gets automatically uninstalled unless the time period is extended by the attackers. The Russian cybersecurity company has codenamed the backdoor&nbsp; TriangleDB . "The implant is deployed after the attackers obtain root privileges on the target iOS device by exploiting a kernel vulnerability," Kaspersky researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today. "It is deployed in memory, meaning that all traces of the implant are lost when the device gets rebooted. Therefore, if the victim reboots their device, the attackers have to reinfect it by sending an iMessage with a malicious attachment, thus launching the whole exploitation chain again."

A security shortcoming in Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) Open Authorization ( OAuth ) process could have been exploited to achieve full account takeover, researchers said. California-based identity and access management service Descope, which discovered and reported the issue in April 2023, dubbed it&nbsp; nOAuth . "nOAuth is an authentication implementation flaw that can affect Microsoft Azure AD multi-tenant OAuth applications," Omer Cohen, chief security officer at Descope,&nbsp; said . The misconfiguration has to do with how a malicious actor can modify email attributes under "Contact Information" in the Azure AD account and exploit the "Log in with Microsoft" feature to hijack a victim account. To pull off the attack, all an adversary has to do is to create and access an Azure AD admin account and modify their email address to that of a victim and take advantage of the single sign-on scheme on a vulnerable app or website.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware called&nbsp; Condi &nbsp;has been observed exploiting a security vulnerability in TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800) Wi-Fi routers to rope the devices into a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet. Fortinet FortiGuard Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;the campaign has ramped up since the end of May 2023. Condi is the work of a threat actor who goes by the online alias zxcr9999 on Telegram and runs a Telegram channel called Condi Network to advertise their warez. "The Telegram channel was started in May 2022, and the threat actor has been monetizing its botnet by providing DDoS-as-a-service and selling the malware source code," security researchers Joie Salvio and Roy Tay said. An analysis of the malware artifact reveals its ability to terminate other competing botnets on the same host. It, however, lacks a persistence mechanism, meaning the program cannot survive a system reboot. To get around this limitation, the malware deletes multiple binaries that are used to shut down or reboot the

Three security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in operational technology (OT) products from Wago and Schneider Electric. The flaws, per Forescout, are part of a&nbsp; broader &nbsp; set &nbsp;of&nbsp; shortcomings &nbsp;collectively called&nbsp; OT:ICEFALL , which now comprises a total of 61 issues spanning 13 different vendors. "OT:ICEFALL demonstrates the need for tighter scrutiny of, and improvements to, processes related to secure design, patching and testing in OT device vendors," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The most severe of the flaws is&nbsp; CVE-2022-46680 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), which concerns the plaintext transmission of credentials in the ION/TCP protocol used by power meters from Schneider Electric. Successful exploitation of the bug could enable threat actors to gain control of vulnerable devices. It's worth noting that CVE-2022-46680 is one among the 56 flaws&nbsp; originally unearthed &nbsp;by Forescout in June 2022. The other two new security holes ( CVE-2023

The Quick Serve Restaurant (QSR) industry is built on consistency and shared resources.

Despite each franchise being independently owned and operated, they share subscriptions to SaaS applications, or use multiple tenants of the same application. Each app is typically segmented by store. Corporate IT and Security has access to the entire database, while each franchise has visibility into its own data.&nbsp; These SaaS apps cover everything from CRMs to supply chains to marketing and HR. The data within is used to understand consumer habits, improve marketing campaigns, and manage employees.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A highly targeted cyber attack against an East Asian IT company involved the deployment of a custom malware written in Golang called&nbsp; RDStealer . "The operation was active for more than a year with the end goal of compromising credentials and data exfiltration," Bitdefender security researcher Victor Vrabie&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. Evidence gathered by the Romanian cybersecurity firm shows that the campaign started in early 2022. The target was an unspecified IT company located in East Asia. In the early phases, the operation relied on readily available remote access trojans like AsyncRAT and Cobalt Strike, before transitioning to bespoke malware in late 2021 or early 2022 in a bid to thwart detection. A primary evasion tactic concerns the use of Microsoft Windows folders that are likely to be excluded from scanning by security software (e.g., System32 and Program Files) to store the backdoor payloads. One of the sub-folders in question

Individuals in the Pakistan region have been targeted using two rogue Android apps available on the Google Play Store as part of a new targeted campaign. Cybersecurity firm Cyfirma attributed the campaign with moderate confidence to a threat actor known as&nbsp; DoNot Team , which is also tracked as APT-C-35 and Viceroy Tiger. The espionage activity involves duping Android smartphone owners into downloading a program that's used to extract contact and location data from unwitting victims. "The motive behind the attack is to gather information via the stager payload and use the gathered information for the second-stage attack, using malware with more destructive features," the company&nbsp; said . DoNot Team &nbsp;is a suspected India-nexus threat actor that has a reputation for carrying out attacks against various countries in South Asia. It has been active since at least 2016.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new information-stealing malware called&nbsp; Mystic Stealer &nbsp;has been found to steal data from about 40 different web browsers and over 70 web browser extensions. First advertised on April 25, 2023, for $150 per month, the malware also targets cryptocurrency wallets, Steam, and Telegram, and employs extensive mechanisms to resist analysis. "The code is heavily obfuscated making use of polymorphic string obfuscation, hash-based import resolution, and runtime calculation of constants,"&nbsp; InQuest &nbsp;and&nbsp; Zscaler &nbsp;researchers said in an analysis published last week. Mystic Stealer, like many other crimeware solutions that are offered for sale, focuses on pilfering data and is implemented in the C programming language. The control panel has been developed using Python. Updates to the malware in May 2023 incorporate a loader component that allows it to retrieve and execute next-stage payloads fetched from a command-and-control (C2) server, making it a more formidable threat.

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a set of malicious artifacts that they say is part of a sophisticated toolkit targeting Apple macOS systems. "As of now, these samples are still largely undetected and very little information is available about any of them," Bitdefender researchers Andrei Lapusneanu and Bogdan Botezatu&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a preliminary report published on Friday. The Romanian firm's analysis is based on an examination of four samples that were uploaded to VirusTotal by an unnamed victim. The earliest sample dates back to April 18, 2023. Two of the three malicious programs are said to be generic Python-based backdoors that are designed to target Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. The payloads have been collectively dubbed&nbsp; JokerSpy . The first constituent is shared.dat, which, once launched, runs an operating system check (0 for Windows, 1 for macOS, and 2 for Linux) and establishes contact with a remote server to fetch additional instructions for execut

Governmental entities in the Middle East and Africa have been at the receiving end of sustained cyber-espionage attacks that leverage never-before-seen and rare credential theft and Exchange email exfiltration techniques. "The main goal of the attacks was to obtain highly confidential and sensitive information, specifically related to politicians, military activities, and ministries of foreign affairs," Lior Rochberger, senior threat researcher at Palo Alto Networks,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical deep dive published last week. The company's Cortex Threat Research team is&nbsp; tracking &nbsp;the activity under the temporary name&nbsp; CL-STA-0043 &nbsp;(where CL stands for cluster and STA stands for state-backed motivation), describing it as a "true advanced persistent threat."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Friday attributed a string of service outages aimed at Azure, Outlook, and OneDrive earlier this month to an uncategorized cluster it tracks under the name&nbsp; Storm-1359 . "These attacks likely rely on access to multiple virtual private servers (VPS) in conjunction with rented cloud infrastructure, open proxies, and DDoS tools," the tech giant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post on Friday. Storm-#### (previously DEV-####) is a temporary designation the Windows maker assigns to unknown, emerging, or developing groups whose identity or affiliation hasn't been definitively established yet. While there is no evidence that any customer data was accessed or compromised, the company noted the attacks "temporarily impacted availability" of some services. Redmond said it further observed the threat actor launching&nbsp; layer 7 DDoS attacks &nbsp;from multiple cloud services and open proxy infrastructures. This includes HTTP(S) flood attacks, which bombard the target services with a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered previously undocumented payloads associated with a Romanian threat actor named&nbsp; Diicot , revealing its potential for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. "The Diicot name is significant, as it's also the name of the&nbsp; Romanian organized crime and anti-terrorism policing unit ," Cado Security&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. "In addition, artifacts from the group's campaigns contain messaging and imagery related to this organization." Diicot (née Mexals) was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Bitdefender in July 2021, uncovering the actor's use of a Go-based SSH brute-forcer tool called Diicot Brute to breach Linux hosts as part of a cryptojacking campaign. Then earlier this April, Akamai&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;what it described as a "resurgence" of the 2021 activity that's believed to have started around October 2022, netting the actor about $10,000 in illicit profits.

The threat actor known as&nbsp; ChamelGang &nbsp;has been observed using a previously undocumented implant to backdoor Linux systems, marking a new expansion of the threat actor's capabilities.

As Threat Actors Continuously Adapt their TTPs in Today's Threat Landscape, So Must You Earlier this year, threat researchers at Cybersixgill released the annual report,&nbsp; The State of the Cybercrime Underground . &nbsp;The research stems from an analysis of Cybersixgill's collected intelligence items throughout 2022, gathered from the deep, dark and clear web. The report examines the continuous evolution of threat actors' tactics, tools, and procedures (TTPs) in the Digital Age – and how organizations can adapt to reduce risk and maintain business resilience. This article summarizes a few of the report's findings, including trends in credit card fraud, observations about cryptocurrency, AI developments and how they're lowering barriers to entry to cybercrime, and the rise of cybercriminal "as-a-service" activities.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Thursday unveiled charges against a Russian national for his alleged involvement in deploying LockBit ransomware to targets in the U.S., Asia, Europe, and Africa. Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov, 20, of Chechen Republic has been accused of perpetrating at least five attacks between August 2020 and March 2023. He was arrested in the state of Arizona last month. "Astamirov allegedly participated in a conspiracy with other members of the LockBit ransomware campaign to commit wire fraud and to intentionally damage protected computers and make ransom demands through the use and deployment of ransomware," the DoJ&nbsp; said . Astamirov, as part of his LockBit-related activities, managed various email addresses, IP addresses, and other online accounts to deploy the ransomware and communicate with the victims.

Third Flaw Uncovered in MOVEit Transfer App Amidst Cl0p Ransomware Mass Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/third-flaw-uncovered-in-moveit-transfer.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Progress Software on Thursday&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a third vulnerability impacting its MOVEit Transfer application, as the Cl0p cybercrime gang deployed extortion tactics against affected companies. The&nbsp; new flaw , which is being tracked as CVE-2023-35708 , also concerns an SQL injection vulnerability that "could lead to escalated privileges and potential unauthorized access to the environment." The company is urging its customers to disable all HTTP and HTTPs traffic to MOVEit Transfer on ports 80 and 443 to safeguard their environments while a fix is being prepared to address the weakness. The cloud managed file transfer solution has been fully patched. The revelation comes a week after Progress&nbsp; divulged &nbsp;another set of SQL injection vulnerabilities ( CVE-2023-35036 ) that it said could be weaponized to access the application's database content. The vulnerabilities join&nbsp; CVE-2023-34362 , which was&nbsp; exploited &nbsp;as a zero-day by the Clop ransomware gang in data theft attacks

While the Android operating system runs on what's called the application processor (AP), it's just one of the many processors of a system-on-chip ( SoC ) that cater to various tasks like cellular communications and multimedia processing.

The social media giant stated the individuals behind the activity impersonated the communities they targeted, propagating content in Arabic, Farsi, and Russian that floated themes of increased military cooperation with the U.S., and criticized Iran, China, and Russia.  These narratives spanned "Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China's treatment of the Uyghur people, Iran's influence in the Middle East, and the support of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan by Russia and China," Meta&nbsp; said &nbsp;in its Quarterly Adversaria

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Meta Platforms has agreed to pay $90 million to settle a lawsuit over the company's use of cookies to allegedly track Facebook users' internet activity even after they had logged off from the platform.  In addition, the social media company will be required to delete all of the data it illegally collected from those users. The development was first reported by&nbsp; Variety .   The decade-old case, filed in 2012, centered around Facebook's use of the proprietary "Like" button to track users as they visited third-party websites – regardless of whether they actually used the button – in violation of the federal wiretapping laws, and then allegedly compiling those browsing histories into profiles for selling the information to advertisers.  Based on the terms of the proposed settlement, users who browsed non-Facebook websites that included the "Like" button between April 22, 2010, and September 26, 2011, will be covered.

Microsoft Disables Internet Macros in Office Apps by Default to Block Malware Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/microsoft-disables-internet-macros-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Monday said it's taking steps to disable Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros by default across its products, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, and Visio, for documents downloaded from the web in an attempt to eliminate an entire class of attack vector.  "Bad actors send macros in Office files to end users who unknowingly enable them, malicious payloads are delivered, and the impact can be severe including malware, compromised identity, data loss, and remote access," Kellie Eickmeyer&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post announcing the move.   While the company does warn users about permitting macros in Office files, unsuspecting users — e.g., recipients of phishing emails — can still be lured into enabling the feature, effectively granting the attackers the ability to gain an initial foothold into the system.  As part of the new change, when a user opens an attachment or downloads from the internet an untrusted Office file containing macros, the app displays a se

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft last week announced that it's temporarily disabling the MSIX ms-appinstaller protocol handler in Windows following evidence that a security vulnerability in the installer component was exploited by threat actors to deliver malware such as Emotet, TrickBot, and Bazaloader.  MSIX , based on a combination of .msi, .appx, App-V and ClickOnce installation technologies, is a universal Windows app package format that allows developers to distribute their applications for the desktop operating system and&nbsp; other platforms . ms-appinstaller, specifically, is designed to help users&nbsp; install a Windows app &nbsp;by simply clicking a link on a website.   But a spoofing vulnerability uncovered in Windows App Installer ( CVE-2021-43890 , CVSS score: 7.1) meant that it could be tricked into installing a rogue app that was never intended to be installed by the user via a malicious attachment used in phishing campaigns.   Although Microsoft released initial patches to address this flaw as part

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of the popular encrypted instant messaging service Signal, has announced that he is stepping down as the chief executive of the non-profit in a move that has been underway over the last few months.  "In other words, after a decade or more, it's difficult to overstate how important Signal is to me, but I now feel very comfortable replacing myself as CEO based on the team we have, and also believe that it is an important step for expanding on Signal's success," Marlinspike&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a blog post on Monday.  Executive chairman and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton will serve as the interim CEO while the search for a replacement is on.  Founded in July 2014, Signal has more than 40 million monthly users, in part driven by a surge of new users in January 2021 when Meta-owned WhatsApp&nbsp; enacted &nbsp;a controversial policy change that sparked a&nbsp; privacy backlash &nbsp;over the nature of personal information shared with its parent company.

Meta Platforms, the company formerly known as Facebook, has announced that it's expanding its&nbsp; bug bounty program &nbsp;to start rewarding valid reports of scraping vulnerabilities across its platforms as well as include reports of scraping data sets that are available online.  "We know that automated activity designed to scrape people's public and private data targets every website or service," said Dan Gurfinkel, security engineering manager at Meta. "We also know that it is a highly adversarial space where scrapers — be it malicious apps, websites or scripts — constantly adapt their tactics to evade detection in response to the defenses we build and improve."   To that end, the social media giant aims to&nbsp; monetarily compensate &nbsp;for valid reports of scraping bugs in its service and identify unprotected or openly public databases containing no less than 100,000 unique Facebook user records with personally identifiable information (PII) such as email, phone numb

In the business world, mergers and acquisitions are commonplace as businesses combine, acquire, and enter various partnerships. Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A) are filled with often very complicated and complex processes to merge business processes, management, and a whole slew of other aspects of combining two businesses into a single logical entity.  In the modern business world before and after the acquisition, a new concern with M&amp;A activities is cybersecurity. What role does cybersecurity play in today's mergers and acquisitions of businesses? Why is it becoming a tremendous concern?  Cybersecurity threats are growing in leaps and bounds  There is no question that cybersecurity risks and threats are growing exponentially. A&nbsp; report from Cybersecurity Ventures &nbsp;estimated a ransomware attack on businesses would happen every 11 seconds in 2021. Global ransomware costs in 2021 would exceed $20 billion.

Google to Auto-Reset Unused Android App Permissions for Billions of Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/google-to-auto-reset-unused-android-app.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Friday said it's bringing an Android 11 feature that auto-resets permissions granted to apps that haven't been used in months, to devices running Android versions 6 and above.  The expansion is expected to go live later this year in December 2021 and enabled on Android phones with Google Play services running Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher, which the company said should cover "billions more devices." Google officially released Android 6.0 Marshmallow on October 5, 2015.   With Android 11 that came out last year, the internet giant introduced a permission auto-reset option that helps improve user privacy by automatically resetting an app's permissions to access sensitive features like storage or camera if the app in question is left unopened for a few months.  "Some apps and permissions are automatically exempted from revocation, like active Device Administrator apps used by enterprises, and permissions fixed by enterprise policy," Google

The Linux community was caught unprepared when, in December 2020, as part of a change in the way Red Hat supports and develops CentOS, Red Hat suddenly announced that it's cutting the official CentOS 8 support window from ten years – to just two, with support ending Dec 31, 2021.  It created a peculiar situation where CentOS 7 users that did the right thing and upgraded quickly to CentOS 8 were left using an OS with just a year's official support remaining – while users of CentOS 7 still get full support until June 30, 2024.  Worse, the fact that stable releases of CentOS were discontinued in exchange for the rolling-release CentOS Stream means that to secure their workloads most CentOS 8 users have to opt for an entirely different Linux distribution, with just a year to choose, evaluate and implement an alternative.  Red Hat's unexpected decision underlined to what degree software users depend on official support windows for their software security. Countless organization

But just because you are small doesn't mean&nbsp; you're not in the firing line .

Meat processing company JBS on Wednesday confirmed it paid extortionists $11 million in bitcoins to regain access to its systems following a destructive ransomware attack late last month.  "In consultation with internal IT professionals and third-party cybersecurity experts, the company made the decision to mitigate any unforeseen issues related to the attack and ensure no data was exfiltrated," JBS USA&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement, with CEO Andre Nogueira adding the firm made the "very difficult decision" to prevent any potential risk for its customers.  Stating that third-party forensic investigations into the incident are still ongoing, the company noted that no company, customer, or employee data was compromised as a consequence of the breach.

Popular short-form video-sharing service TikTok quietly revised its privacy policy in the U.S., allowing it to automatically collect biometric information such as faceprints and voiceprints from the content its users post on the platform.
