Two Spyware Apps on Google Play with 1.5 Million Users Sending Data to China<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/two-spyware-apps-on-google-play-with-15.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two file management apps on the Google Play Store have been discovered to be spyware, putting the privacy and security of up to 1.5 million Android users at risk. These apps engage in deceptive behaviour and secretly send sensitive user data to malicious servers in China. Pradeo, a leading mobile security company, has uncovered this alarming infiltration. The report shows that both spyware apps, namely File Recovery and Data Recovery (com.spot.music.filedate) with over 1 million installs, and File Manager (com.file.box.master.gkd) with over 500,000 installs, are developed by the same group. These seemingly harmless Android apps use similar malicious tactics and automatically launch when the device reboots without user input. Contrary to what they claim on the Google Play Store, where both apps assure users that no data is collected, Pradeo's analytics engine has found that various personal information is collected without users' knowledge. Stolen data includes contact list

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Instagram Threads, the upcoming Twitter competitor from Meta, will not be launched in the European Union due to privacy concerns, according to Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC). The development was&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by the Irish Independent, which said the watchdog has been in contact with the social media giant about the new product and confirmed the release won't extend to the E.U. "at this point." Threads &nbsp;is Meta's answer to Twitter that's set for launch on July 6, 2023. It's billed as a "text-based conversation app" that allows Instagram users to "discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what'll be trending tomorrow." It also enables users to follow the same accounts they already follow on Instagram. A listing for the app has already appeared in the&nbsp; Apple App Store &nbsp;and&nbsp; Google Play Store , although it's yet to be available for download.

Apple's Safari Private Browsing Now Automatically Removes Tracking Parameters in URLs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/apples-safari-private-browsing-now.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple is introducing major updates to&nbsp; Safari Private Browsing , offering users better protections against third-party trackers as they browse the web. "Advanced tracking and fingerprinting protections go even further to help prevent websites from using the latest techniques to track or identify a user's device," the iPhone maker&nbsp; said . "Private Browsing now locks when not in use, allowing a user to keep tabs open even when stepping away from the device." The privacy improvements were previewed at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) last week. They are expected to be rolled out to users as part of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma later this year. Another key change includes Link Tracking Protection in Mail, Messages, and Safari's private mode to automatically remove&nbsp; tracking parameters &nbsp;in URLs, which are often used to track information about a click.

Google has announced plans to officially flip the switch on its twice-delayed&nbsp; Privacy Sandbox &nbsp;initiatives as it slowly works its way to deprecate support for third-party cookies in Chrome browser. To that end, the search and advertising giant said it intends to phase out third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users globally in the first quarter of 2024. "This will support developers in conducting real world experiments that assess the readiness and effectiveness of their products without third-party cookies," Anthony Chavez, vice president of Privacy Sandbox at Google,&nbsp; said . Prior to rolling this out, Google said it would introduce the ability for third-party developers to simulate the process for a configurable subset of their users (up to 10%) in Q4 2023.

Apple and Google have&nbsp; teamed up &nbsp;to work on a&nbsp; draft industry-wide specification &nbsp;that's designed to tackle safety risks and alert users when they are being tracked without their knowledge or permission using devices like AirTags. "The first-of-its-kind specification will allow Bluetooth location-tracking devices to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection and alerts across Android and iOS platforms," the companies said in a joint statement. While these trackers are primarily designed to keep tabs on personal belongings like keys, wallets, luggage, and other items, such devices have also been abused by bad actors for&nbsp; criminal or nefarious purposes , including instances of&nbsp; stalking, harassment, and theft . The goal is to standardize the alerting mechanisms and minimize opportunities for misuse across Bluetooth location-tracking devices from different vendors.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has officially made a return to Italy after the company met the&nbsp; data protection authority's demands &nbsp;ahead of April 30, 2023, deadline. The development was&nbsp; first reported &nbsp;by the Associated Press. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman,&nbsp; tweeted , "we're excited ChatGPT is available in [Italy] again!" The reinstatement comes following Garante's decision to&nbsp; temporarily block &nbsp;access to the popular AI chatbot service in Italy on March 31, 2023, over concerns that its practices are in violation of data protection laws in the region. Generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Google Bard primarily rely on huge amounts of information freely available on the internet as well as the data its users provide over the course of their interactions. OpenAI, which published a&nbsp; new FAQ , said it filters and removes information such as hate speech, adult content, sites that primarily aggregate personal information, and spam.

Israeli spyware maker NSO Group deployed at least three novel "zero-click" exploits against iPhones in 2022 to infiltrate defenses erected by Apple and deploy Pegasus, according to the latest findings from Citizen Lab. "NSO Group customers widely deployed at least three iOS 15 and iOS 16 zero-click exploit chains against civil society targets around the world," the interdisciplinary laboratory based at the University of Toronto&nbsp; said . NSO Group is the manufacturer of&nbsp; Pegasus , a sophisticated cyber weapon that's capable of extracting sensitive information stored in a device – e.g., messages, locations, photos, and call logs, among others — in real-time. It's typically delivered to targeted iPhones using zero-click and/or zero-day exploits.

A number of zero-day vulnerabilities that were addressed last year were exploited by commercial spyware vendors to target Android and iOS devices, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has revealed. The two distinct campaigns were both limited and highly targeted, taking advantage of the patch gap between the release of a fix and when it was actually deployed on the targeted devices. "These vendors are enabling the proliferation of dangerous hacking tools, arming governments that would not be able to develop these capabilities in-house," TAG's Clement Lecigne&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "While use of surveillance technologies may be legal under national or international laws, they are often found to be used by governments to target dissidents, journalists, human rights workers, and opposition party politicians." The first of the two operations took place in November 2022 and involved sending shortened links over SMS messages to users located in Italy, Malays

Tainted VPN installers are being used to deliver a piece of surveillanceware dubbed&nbsp; EyeSpy &nbsp;as part of a malware campaign that started in May 2022.

As of November 2021, it's offered for sale anywhere between $99 to $200.

Google to Pay $29.5 Million to Settle Lawsuits Over User Location Tracking<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/google-to-pay-295-million-to-settle.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has agreed to pay a total of $29.5 million to settle two different lawsuits brought by Indiana and Washington, D.C., over its "deceptive" location tracking practices. The search and advertising giant is required to pay&nbsp; $9.5 million to D.C. &nbsp;and&nbsp; $20 million to Indiana &nbsp;after the states sued the company for charges that the company tracked users' locations without their express consent. The settlement adds to the&nbsp; $391.5 million &nbsp;Google agreed to pay to 40 states over similar allegations last month. The company is still facing two more location-tracking lawsuits in&nbsp; Texas &nbsp;and&nbsp; Washington . The lawsuits came in response to revelations in 2018 that the internet company continued to track users' whereabouts on Android and iOS through a setting called&nbsp; Web &amp; App Activity &nbsp;despite turning&nbsp; Location History &nbsp;options off. Google was also accused of employing&nbsp; dark patterns , which refer to design choices intended to deceive users into carrying out actions t

Experts Warn of New RatMilad Android Spyware Targeting Enterprise Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/experts-warn-of-new-ratmilad-android.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A novel Android malware called RatMilad has been observed targeting a Middle Eastern enterprise mobile device by concealing itself as a VPN and phone number spoofing app.  The mobile trojan functions as advanced spyware with capabilities that receives and executes commands to collect and exfiltrate a wide variety of data from the infected mobile endpoint, Zimperium&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Evidence gathered by the mobile security company shows that the malicious app is distributed through links on social media and communication tools like Telegram, tricking unsuspecting users into sideloading the app and granting it extensive permissions.   The idea behind embedding the malware within a fake VPN and phone number spoofing service is also clever in that the app claims to enable users to verify social media accounts via phone, a technique popular in countries where access is restricted.  "Once installed and in control, the attackers could access the camera to

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new wave of a mobile surveillance campaign has been observed targeting the Uyghur community as part of a long-standing spyware operation active since at least 2015, cybersecurity researchers disclosed Thursday.  The intrusions, originally attributed to a threat actor named&nbsp; Scarlet Mimic &nbsp;back in January 2016, is said to have encompassed 20 different variants of the Android malware, which were disguised as book, pictures, and an audio version of the Quran.  The malware, while relatively unsophisticated from a technical standpoint, comes with extensive capabilities to steal sensitive data from an infected device, send SMS messages on the victim's behalf, make phone calls, and track their locations.   Additionally, it allows the recording of incoming and outgoing phone calls as well as surrounding audio.  "All this makes it a powerful and dangerous surveillance tool," Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical deepdive, calling the spyware&nbsp; MobileOrder

A previously undocumented strain of Android spyware with extensive information gathering capabilities has been found disguised as a book likely designed to target the&nbsp; Uyghur community &nbsp;in China.  The malware comes under the guise of a book titled " The China Freedom Trap ," a biography written by the exiled Uyghur leader Dolkun Isa.

The existence of the malware samples, which come with the package name " com.emc.pdf ," was first disclosed by researchers from the&nbsp; MalwareHunterTeam &nbsp;late last month.

New Amazon Ring Vulnerability Could Have Exposed All Your Camera Recordings<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/new-amazon-ring-vulnerability-could.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Retail giant Amazon patched a high-severity security issue in its Ring app for Android in May that could have enabled a rogue application installed on a user's device to access sensitive information and camera recordings.  The Ring app for Android has over 10 million downloads and enables users to monitor video feeds from smart home devices such as video doorbells, security cameras, and alarm systems. Amazon acquired the doorbell maker for about $1 billion in 2018.  Application security firm Checkmarx&nbsp; explained &nbsp;it identified a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw that it said could be weaponized as part of an attack chain to trick victims into installing a malicious app.   The app can then be used to get hold of the user's Authorization Token, that can be subsequently leveraged to extract the session cookie by sending this information alongside the device's hardware ID, which is also encoded in the token, to the endpoint "ring[.]com/mobile/authorize."

Google on Wednesday said it's once again delaying its plans to turn off third-party cookies in the Chrome web browser from late 2023 to the second half of 2024.  "The most consistent feedback we've received is the need for more time to evaluate and test the new Privacy Sandbox technologies before deprecating third-party cookies in Chrome," Anthony Chavez, vice president of Privacy Sandbox,&nbsp; said .  In keeping this in mind, the internet and ad tech giant said it's taking a "deliberate approach" and&nbsp; extending the testing window &nbsp;for its ongoing Privacy Sandbox initiatives prior to phasing out third-party cookies.  Cookies are pieces of data planted on a user's computer or other device by the web browser as a website is accessed, with third-party cookies  fueling much of the digital advertising ecosystem and its ability to track users across different sites to show targeted ads.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Thai activists involved in the country's pro-democracy protests have had their smartphones infected with the infamous Pegasus government-sponsored spyware.  At least 30 individuals, spanning activists, academics, lawyers, and NGO workers, are believed to have been infected between October 2020 and November 2021, many of whom have been previously detained, arrested and imprisoned for their political activities or criticism of the government.  "The timing of the infections is highly relevant to specific political events in Thailand, as well as specific actions by the Thai justice system," the Citizen Lab&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Sunday report. "In many cases, for example, infections occurred slightly before protests and other political activities by the victims."  The findings are the result of&nbsp; threat notifications &nbsp;sent by Apple last November to alert users it believes have been targeted by state-sponsored attackers.   The attacks entailed the use of two zero-click exploits

TikTok Postpones Privacy Policy Update in Europe After Italy Warns of GDPR Breach<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/tiktok-postpones-privacy-policy-update.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Popular video-sharing platform TikTok on Tuesday agreed to pause a controversial privacy policy update that could have allowed it to serve targeted ads based on users' activity on the social video platform without their permission to do so.  The reversal, reported by&nbsp; TechCrunch , comes a day after the Italian data protection authority — the Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali — warned the company against the change, citing violations of data protection laws.  "The personal data stored in users' devices may not be used to profile those users and send personalized ads without their explicit consent," the Garante&nbsp; said .   The formal warning was in response to a privacy policy revision that noted it had historically asked users' "consent" to their on-TikTok activity and off-TikTok activity to serve personalized ads and that, therefore, it intends to stop asking users for their permission to profile their behavior and process personal data.

Following heightened worries that U.S. users' data had been accessed by TikTok engineers in China between September 2021 and January 2022, the company sought to assuage U.S. lawmakers that it's taking steps to "strengthen data security."  The admission that some China-based employees can access information from U.S. users came in a letter sent to nine senators, which further noted that the procedure requires the individuals to clear numerous internal security protocols.  The contents of the letter, first&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by The New York Times, shares more details about TikTok's plans to address data security concerns through a multi-pronged initiative codenamed "Project Texas."

The beleaguered Israeli surveillanceware vendor NSO Group this week admitted to the European Union lawmakers that its Pegasus tool was used by at least five countries in the region.  "We're trying to do the right thing and that's more than other companies working in the industry," Chaim Gelfand, the company's general counsel and chief compliance officer, said, according to a&nbsp; report &nbsp;from Politico.  Acknowledging that it had "made mistakes," the company also stressed on the need for an international standard to regulate the government use of spyware.   The disclosure comes as a special inquiry committee was&nbsp; launched in April 2022 &nbsp;to investigate alleged breaches of E.U. law following revelations that the company's Pegasus spyware is being used to snoop on phones belonging to politicians, diplomats, and civil society members.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An enterprise-grade surveillanceware dubbed Hermit  has been put to use by entities operating from within Kazakhstan, Syria, and Italy over the years since 2019, new research has revealed.  Lookout attributed the spy software, which is equipped to target both Android and iOS, to an Italian company named RCS Lab S.p.A and Tykelab Srl, a telecom services provider which it suspects to be a front company. The San Francisco-based cybersecurity firm said it detected the campaign aimed at Kazakhstan in April 2022.  Hermit is modular and comes with myriad capabilities that allow it to "exploit a rooted device, record audio and make and redirect phone calls, as well as collect data such as call logs, contacts, photos, device location and SMS messages," Lookout researchers Justin Albrecht and Paul Shunk&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new write-up.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly designed privacy-sensitive architecture aims to enable developers to create smart home apps in a manner that addresses data sharing concerns and puts users in control over their personal information.&nbsp;  Dubbed&nbsp; Peekaboo &nbsp;by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, the&nbsp; system &nbsp;"leverages an in-home hub to pre-process and minimize outgoing data in a structured and enforceable manner before sending it to external cloud servers."  Peekaboo operates on the principle of data minimization, which refers to the practice of limiting data collection to only what is required to fulfill a specific purpose.   To achieve this the system requires developers to explicitly declare the relevant data collection behaviors in the form of a manifest file that's then fed into an in-home trusted hub to transmit sensitive data from smart home apps such as smart doorbells on a need-to-know basis.  The hub not only functions as a mediator between raw data from IoT devices and the respec

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics has devised a system that can be used on a phone or a laptop to identify and locate Wi-Fi-connected hidden IoT devices in unfamiliar physical spaces.  With hidden cameras being&nbsp; increasingly &nbsp; used &nbsp;to&nbsp; snoop &nbsp;on&nbsp; individuals &nbsp;in hotel rooms and Airbnbs, the goal is to be able to pinpoint such rogue devices without much of a hassle.  The system, dubbed Lumos , is designed with this intent in mind and to "visualize their presence using an augmented reality interface,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Rahul Anand Sharma, Elahe Soltanaghaei, Anthony Rowe, and Vyas Sekar of Carnegie Mellon University in a new paper.   At its core, the platform works by snuffing and collecting encrypted wireless packets over the air to detect and identify concealed devices. Subsequently, it estimates the location of each identified device with respect to the user as they walk around the perimeter of the space.  The localization module, for its part, combines signal strength measurements that are avail

Cytrox's Predator Spyware Targeted Android Users with Zero-Day Exploits<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/cytroxs-predator-spyware-target-android.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) on Thursday pointed fingers at a North Macedonian spyware developer named Cytrox for developing exploits against five zero-day (aka 0-day) flaws, four in Chrome and one in Android, to target Android users.  "The 0-day exploits were used alongside n-day exploits as the developers took advantage of the time difference between when some critical bugs were patched but not flagged as security issues and when these patches were fully deployed across the Android ecosystem," TAG researchers Clement Lecigne and Christian Resell&nbsp; said .  Cytrox is alleged to have packaged the exploits and sold them to different government-backed actors located in Egypt, Armenia, Greece, Madagascar, Côte d'Ivoire, Serbia, Spain, and Indonesia, who, in turn, weaponized the bugs in at least three different campaigns.  The commercial surveillance company is the maker of&nbsp; Predator , an implant&nbsp; analogous &nbsp;to that of NSO Group's&nbsp; Pegasus , and is known to hav

A new research published by academics from KU Leuven, Radboud University, and the University of Lausanne has revealed that users' email addresses are exfiltrated to tracking, marketing, and analytics domains before such is submitted and without prior consent.  The study&nbsp; involved &nbsp;crawling 2.8 million pages from the top 100 websites, and found that as many as 1,844 websites allowed trackers to capture email addresses before form submission in the European Union, a number that jumped to 2,950 when the same set of websites were visited from the U.S.  "Emails (or their hashes) were sent to 174 distinct domains ( eTLD+1 ) in the U.S. crawl, and 157 distinct domains in the EU crawl," the researchers&nbsp; said . Furthermore, 52 websites were determined to be collecting passwords in the same manner, an issue that has since been addressed following responsible disclosure.   LiveRamp, Taboola, Adobe, Verizon, Yandex, Meta Platforms, TikTok, Salesforce, Listrak, and Oracle accounted f

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has officially&nbsp; released &nbsp;the first developer preview for the Privacy Sandbox  on Android 13, offering an "early look" at the SDK Runtime and Topics API to boost users' privacy online.  "The Privacy Sandbox on Android Developer Preview program will run over the course of 2022, with a beta release planned by the end of the year," the search giant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an overview.  A "multi-year effort,"&nbsp; Privacy Sandbox &nbsp;on Android aims to create technologies that's both privacy-preserving as well as keep online content and services free without having to resort to opaque methods of digital advertising.   The idea is to limit sharing of user data with third-parties and operate without cross-app identifiers, including advertising ID, a unique, user-resettable string of letters and digits that can be used to track users as they move between apps.  Google originally&nbsp; announced &nbsp;its plans to bring Privacy Sandbox to Android earlier this February, following

Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla and Twitter's new owner, on Thursday called on adding support for end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to the platform's direct messages ( DM ) feature.  "Twitter DMs should have end to end encryption like Signal, so no one can spy on or hack your messages," Musk&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a tweet.  The statement comes days after the microblogging service&nbsp; announced &nbsp;it officially entered into an agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, with the transaction valued at approximately US$ 44 billion, or US$ 54.20 per share in cash.&nbsp;   The deal, which is expected to be closed over the next six months, will see it becoming a privately held company.  "Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," Musk said in a statement.

Google on Tuesday officially began rolling out a new "Data safety" section for Android apps on the Play Store to highlight the type of data being collected and shared with third-parties.  "Users want to know for what purpose their data is being collected and whether the developer is sharing user data with third parties," Suzanne Frey, Vice President of product for Android security and privacy,&nbsp; said . "In addition, users want to understand how app developers are securing user data after an app is downloaded."  The transparency measure, which is built along the lines of Apple's " Privacy Nutrition Labels ," was&nbsp; first announced &nbsp;by Google nearly a year ago in May 2021.   The Data safety section, which will show up against every app listing on the digital storefront, presents a unified view of what data is being collected, for what purpose it's being used, and how it's handled, while also highlighting what data is being shared with thi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Senior officials in the European Union were allegedly targeted with NSO Group's infamous Pegasus surveillance tool, according to a&nbsp; new report &nbsp;from Reuters.  At least five individuals, including European Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders, are said to have been singled out in total, the news agency said, citing documents and two unnamed E.U. officials. However, it's not clear who used the commercial spyware against them or what information was obtained following the attacks.  NSO Group said in a statement shared with Reuters that it was not responsible for the hacking attempts, adding that the targeting "could not have happened with NSO's tools."  The targeting is said to have come to light after Apple notified the victims of state-sponsored attacks last November as part of its efforts to stop the Israeli surveillance firm from targeting its customers.   That same month, the iPhone maker&nbsp; filed a lawsuit &nbsp;against NSO Group, seeking a court-issued injunction ai

An Android spyware application has been spotted masquerading as a "Process Manager" service to stealthily siphon sensitive information stored in the infected devices.  Interestingly, the app — that has the package name " com.remote.app " — establishes contact with a remote command-and-control server, 82.146.35[.]240, which has been previously identified as infrastructure belonging to the Russia-based hacking group known as&nbsp; Turla .   "When the application is run, a warning appears about the permissions granted to the application," Lab52 researchers&nbsp; said . "These include screen unlock attempts, lock the screen, set the device global proxy, set screen lock password expiration, set storage encryption and disable cameras."  Once the app is "activated," the malware removes its gear-shaped icon from the home screen and runs in the background, abusing its wide permissions to access the device's contacts and call logs, track its location,

A group of academics has designed a new system known as " Privid " that enables video analytics in a privacy-preserving manner to combat concerns with invasive tracking.

If there's a camera on every street corner, every place you go, and if someone could actually process all of those videos in aggregate, you can imagine that entity building a very precise timeline of when and where a person has gone," Frank Cangialosi, the lead author of the study and a researcher at the MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL),&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement.   "People are already worried about location privacy with GPS — video data in aggregate could capture not only your location history, but also moods, behaviors, and more at each location," Cangialosi added.

The European Union's data protection authority on Tuesday called for a ban on the development and the use of Pegasus-like commercial spyware in the region, calling out the technology's "unprecedented level of intrusiveness" that could endanger users' right to privacy.

Google Drops FLoC and Introduces Topics API to Replace Tracking Cookies for Ads<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/google-drops-floc-and-introduces-topics.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday announced that it is abandoning its controversial plans for replacing third-party cookies in favor of a new Privacy Sandbox proposal called&nbsp; Topics , which categorizes users' browsing habits into approximately 350 topics.  The new  mechanism , which takes the place of&nbsp; FLoC &nbsp;(short for Federated Learning of Cohorts), slots users' browsing history for a given week into a handful of top pre-designated interests (i.e., topics), which are retained only on the device for a revolving period of three weeks.  Subsequently, when a user visits a participating site, the Topics API selects three of the interests — one topic from each of the past three weeks — to share with the site and its advertising partners. To give more control over the framework, users can not only see the topics but also remove topics or disable it altogether.   By labeling each website with a recognizable, high-level topic and sharing the most frequent topics associated with the browsing history,

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday took the wraps off a multi-stage espionage campaign targeting high-ranking government officials overseeing national security policy and individuals in the defense industry in Western Asia.  The attack is unique as it leverages Microsoft OneDrive as a command-and-control (C2) server and is split into as many as six stages to stay as hidden as possible, Trellix — a new company created following the merger of security firms McAfee Enterprise and FireEye — said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This type of communication allows the malware to go unnoticed in the victims' systems since it will only connect to legitimate Microsoft domains and won't show any suspicious network traffic," Trellix explained.  First signs of activity associated with the covert operation are said to have commenced as early as June 18, 2021, with two victims reported on September 21 and 29, followed by 17 more in a short span of three days between Octo

Meta Platforms, the company formerly known as Facebook, on Friday announced the launch of a centralized Privacy Center that aims to "educate people" about its approach with regards to how it collects and processes personal information across its family of social media apps.

The first module, Security, will offer easy access to common tools such as account security settings and two-factor authentication. Sharing will provide specifics about post visibility and settings to archive or trash old posts. Collection and Use will give users a quick glance into the type of data Meta harvests and learn how and why it's used, respectively. Lastly, the Ads section will furnish information regarding a user's ad preferences.  The learning hub is expected to be initially limited to a s

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (CNIL), France's data protection watchdog, has slapped Facebook (now Meta Platforms) and Google with fines of €150 million ($170 million) and €60 million ($68 million) for violating E.U. privacy rules by failing to provide users with an easy option to reject cookie tracking technology.  "The websites facebook.com, google.fr and youtube.com offer a button allowing the user to immediately accept cookies," the&nbsp; authority &nbsp; said . "However, they do not provide an equivalent solution (button or other) enabling the Internet user to easily refuse the deposit of these cookies."   Facebook told&nbsp; TechCrunch &nbsp;that it was reviewing the ruling, while Google said it's working to change its practices in response to the CNIL fines.

Meta Platforms on Thursday revealed it took steps to deplatform seven cyber mercenaries that it said carried out "indiscriminate" targeting of journalists, dissidents, critics of authoritarian regimes, families of opposition, and human rights activists located in over 100 countries, amid mounting scrutiny of surveillance technologies.  To that end, the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;it alerted 50,000 users of Facebook and Instagram that their accounts were spied on by the companies, who offer a variety of services that run the spyware gamut from hacking tools for infiltrating mobile phones to creating fake social media accounts to monitor targets. It also removed 1,500 Facebook and Instagram accounts linked to these firms.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Russia has stepped up its censorship efforts in the country by fully blocking access to the Tor web anonymity service, coinciding with the&nbsp; ban &nbsp;of six virtual private network (VPN) operators, as the government continues its efforts to control the internet and crack down on attempts to circumvent locally imposed web restrictions.  The Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media, also known as Roskomnadzor, the watchdog responsible for monitoring, controlling and censoring Russian mass media, announced the block, accusing it of enabling access to illegal content, Reuters&nbsp; reported &nbsp;this week.   Russia&nbsp; accounts &nbsp;for 15% of all Tor users, with more than 310,000 daily users, second only to the U.S.  Tor, short for The Onion Router,&nbsp; enables &nbsp;users to automatically encrypt and reroute their web requests through a network of Tor relays for anonymizing network traffic, as well as help bypass censorship and protect their identities from the intern

New Chinotto Spyware Targets North Korean Defectors, Human Rights Activists<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/new-chinotto-spyware-targets-north.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
North Korean defectors, journalists who cover North Korea-related news, and entities in South Korea are being zeroed in on by a nation-state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) as part of a new wave of highly-targeted surveillance attacks.  Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky attributed the infiltrations to a North Korean hacker group tracked as&nbsp; ScarCruft , also known as&nbsp; APT37 , Reaper Group, InkySquid, and Ricochet Chollima.  "The actor utilized three types of malware with similar functionalities: versions implemented in PowerShell, Windows executables and Android applications," the company's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today. "Although intended for different platforms, they share a similar command and control scheme based on HTTP communication. Therefore, the malware operators can control the whole malware family through one set of command and control scripts."   Likely active since at least 2012, ScarC

Israeli spyware vendor Candiru, which was&nbsp; added &nbsp;to an economic blocklist by the U.S. government this month, is said to have reportedly waged "watering hole" attacks against high-profile entities in the U.K. and the Middle East, new findings reveal.  "The victimized websites belong to media outlets in the U.K., Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, as well as to Hezbollah; to government institutions in Iran (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), Syria (including the Ministry of Electricity), and Yemen (including the Ministries of Interior and Finance); to internet service providers in Yemen and Syria; and to aerospace/military technology companies in Italy and South Africa," ESET&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "The attackers also created a website mimicking a medical trade fair in Germany."  The strategic web compromises are believed to have occurred in two waves, the first commencing as early as March 2020 before ending in August 2020, and the second string of attacks beginning in

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Facebook's&nbsp; newly-rebranded &nbsp;parent company Meta on Tuesday announced plans to discontinue its decade-old "Face Recognition" system and delete a massive trove of more than a billion users' facial recognition templates as part of a wider initiative to limit the use of the technology across its products.  The Menlo Park tech giant&nbsp; described &nbsp;the about-face as "one of the largest shifts in facial recognition usage in the technology's history."  The shutdown, which is expected to take place over the coming weeks, will mean users who have previously opted into the setting will no longer be automatically recognized in Memories, photos and videos or see suggested tags with their name in photos and videos they may appear in. Furthermore, the company's Automatic Alt Text (AAT) tool, which creates image descriptions for visually impaired people, will no longer include the names of people identified in photos.

A prominent Togolese human rights defender has been targeted with spyware by a threat actor known for striking victims in South Asia, marking the hacking group's first foray into digital surveillance in Africa.  Amnesty International tied the covert attack campaign to a collective tracked as " Donot Team " (aka APT-C-35), which has been linked to cyber offensives in India and Pakistan, while also identifying apparent evidence coupling the group's infrastructure to an Indian company called Innefu Labs. The unnamed activist is believed to have targeted over a period of two months starting in December 2019 with the help of fake Android applications and spyware-loaded emails.  "The persistent attacks over WhatsApp and email tried to trick the victim into installing a malicious application that masqueraded as a secure chat application," Amnesty International&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new as-yet unpatched weakness in Apple's iCloud Private Relay feature could be circumvented to leak users' true IP addresses from iOS devices running the latest version of the operating system.  Introduced with iOS 15, which was officially released this week,&nbsp; iCloud Private Relay &nbsp;aims to improve anonymity on the web by employing a dual-hop architecture that effectively shields users' IP address, location, and DNS requests from websites and network service providers.  It achieves this by routing users' internet traffic on the Safari browser through two proxies in order to mask who's browsing and where that data is coming from in what could be viewed as a simplified version of Tor.&nbsp;   However, the feature is available to iCloud+ subscribers running iOS 15 or macOS 12 Monterey and above.

ProtonMail Shares Activist's IP Address With Authorities Despite Its "No Log" Claims<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/protonmail-shares-activists-ip-address.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
End-to-end encrypted email service provider ProtonMail has&nbsp; drawn &nbsp; criticism &nbsp;after it ceded to a legal request and shared the IP address of anti-gentrification activists with law enforcement authorities, leading to their arrests in France.  The Switzerland-based company said it received a "legally binding order from the Swiss Federal Department of Justice" related to a collective called Youth for Climate, which it was "obligated to comply with," compelling it to handover the IP address and information related to the type of device used by the group to access the ProtonMail account.   On its website, ProtonMail&nbsp; advertises &nbsp;that: "No personal information is required to create your secure email account. By default, we do not keep any IP logs which can be linked to your anonymous email account. Your privacy comes first."   Despite its no IP logs claims, the company acknowledged that while it's illegal for the company to abide by requests from non-Swiss

Apple Delays Plans to Scan Devices for Child Abuse Images After Privacy Backlash<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/apple-delays-plans-to-scan-devices-for.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple is temporarily hitting the pause button on its&nbsp; controversial plans &nbsp;to screen users' devices for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) after receiving sustained blowback over worries that the tool could be weaponized for mass surveillance and erode the privacy of users.  "Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers, and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features," the iPhone maker&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement on its website.  The changes were originally slated to go live with iOS 15 and macOS Monterey later this year.   In August, Apple detailed several new features intended to help limit the spread of CSAM on its platform, including scanning users' iCloud Photos libraries for illicit content, Communication Safety in Messages app to warn children and their parents when receiving or sending sexually explicit photos, and e

A previously undisclosed "zero-click" exploit in Apple's iMessage was abused by Israeli surveillance vendor NSO Group to circumvent iOS security protections and target nine Bahraini activists.  "The hacked activists included three members of Waad (a secular Bahraini political society), three members of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, two exiled Bahraini dissidents, and one member of Al Wefaq (a Shiite Bahraini political society)," researchers from University of Toronto's Citizen Lab&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today, with four of the targets hacked by an actor it tracks as LULU and believed to be the government of Bahrain.  Citizen Lab called the new exploit chain "FORCEDENTRY."&nbsp;   The development comes a little over a month after an&nbsp; extensive investigation &nbsp;undertaken by a consortium of 17 media organizations revealed the widespread use of NSO Group's Pegasus "military-grade spyware" by authoritarian regimes to&nbsp; facilitate hu

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple on Thursday said it's introducing new child safety features in iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and macOS as part of its efforts to limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) in the U.S.  To that effect, the iPhone maker said it intends to begin client-side scanning of images shared via every Apple device for known child abuse content as they are being uploaded into iCloud Photos, in addition to leveraging on-device machine learning to vet all iMessage images sent or received by minor accounts (aged under 13) to warn parents of sexually explicit photos shared over the messaging platform.  Furthermore, Apple also plans to update Siri and Search to stage an intervention when users try to perform searches for CSAM-related topics, alerting that the "interest in this topic is harmful and problematic."  "Messages uses on-device machine learning to analyze image attachments and determine if a photo is sexually explicit," Apple&nbsp; noted . "The feature is desi

A New Spyware is Targeting Telegram and Psiphon VPN Users in Iran<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/a-new-spyware-is-targeting-telegram-and.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors with suspected ties to Iran have been found to leverage instant messaging and VPN apps like Telegram and Psiphon to install a Windows remote access trojan (RAT) capable of stealing sensitive information from targets' devices since at least 2015.  Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which pieced together the activity, attributed the campaign to an advanced persistent threat (APT) group it tracks as Ferocious Kitten, a group that has singled out Persian-speaking individuals allegedly based in the country while successfully operating under the radar.  "The targeting of Psiphon and Telegram, both of which are quite popular services in Iran, underlines the fact that the payloads were developed with the purpose of targeting Iranian users in mind," Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT)&nbsp; said .   "Moreover, the decoy content displayed by the malicious files often made use of political themes and involved images or videos of resistance bas

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google's upcoming plans to replace third-party cookies with a less invasive ad targeted mechanism have a number of issues that could defeat its privacy objectives and allow for significant linkability of user behavior, possibly even identifying individual users.  "FLoC is premised on a compelling idea: enable ad targeting without exposing users to risk,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Eric Rescorla, author of TLS standard and chief technology officer of Mozilla. "But the current design has a number of privacy properties that could create significant risks if it were to be widely deployed in its current form."  Short for Federated Learning of Cohorts,&nbsp; FLoC &nbsp;is part of Google's fledgling&nbsp; Privacy Sandbox &nbsp;initiative that aims to develop alternate solutions to satisfy cross-site use cases without resorting to third-party cookies or other opaque tracking mechanisms.

Hackers Can Exploit Samsung Pre-Installed Apps to Spy On Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/hackers-can-exploit-samsung-pre.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple critical security flaws have been disclosed in Samsung's pre-installed Android apps, which, if successfully exploited, could have allowed adversaries access to personal data without users' consent and take control of the devices.&nbsp;  "The impact of these bugs could have allowed an attacker to access and edit the victim's contacts, calls, SMS/MMS, install arbitrary apps with device administrator rights, or read and write arbitrary files on behalf of a system user which could change the device's settings," Sergey Toshin, founder of mobile security startup Oversecured,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published Thursday.   Toshin reported the flaws to Samsung in February 2021, following which&nbsp; patches were issued &nbsp;by the manufacturer as part of its monthly security updates for April and May. The list of the seven vulnerabilities is as follows -   CVE-2021-25356 &nbsp;- third-party authentication bypass in Managed Provisioning  CVE-2021-25388 &nbsp;- Arbitrary app installation

Google to Let Android Users Opt-Out to Stop Ads From Tracking Them<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/google-to-let-android-users-opt-out-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google is tightening the privacy practices that could make it harder for apps on Android phones and tablets to track users who have opted out of receiving personalized interest-based ads. The change will go into effect sometime in late 2021.  The development, which mirrors Apple's move to enable iPhone and iPad users to opt-out of ad tracking, was first&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by the Financial Times.&nbsp;  Once the revised policy goes live, Google is expected to completely cut off developers' access to the so-called "Advertising IDs," showing a "string of zeros" in its place. The Google Advertising ID (AAID), analogous to Apple's&nbsp; IDFA , is a unique device identifier that can be used by app developers to track users as they move between apps to target ads better and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.   "Starting in late 2021, when a user opts out of interest-based advertising or ads personalization, the advertising identifier will not be available,&amp;q

The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) used a partnership with Denmark's foreign and military intelligence service to eavesdrop on top politicians and high-ranking officials in Germany, Sweden, Norway, and France by tapping into Danish underwater internet cables between 2012 and 2014.  Details of the covert wiretapping were&nbsp; broken &nbsp;by Copenhagen-based public broadcaster DR over the weekend based on interviews with nine unnamed sources, all of whom are said to have access to classified information held by the Danish Defence Intelligence Service (Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste or FE).  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the then-German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and the opposition leader at the time, Peer Steinbrück, are said to have been targeted through the Danish-American pact.

In July 2018, when Guizhou-Cloud Big Data (GCBD)&nbsp; agreed to a deal &nbsp;with state-owned telco China Telecom to move users' iCloud data belonging to Apple's China-based users to the latter's servers, the shift raised concerns that it could make user data vulnerable to state surveillance.  Now, according to a&nbsp; deep-dive report &nbsp;from The New York Times, Apple's privacy and security concessions have "made it nearly impossible for the company to stop the Chinese government from gaining access to the emails, photos, documents, contacts and locations of millions of Chinese residents."  The revelations stand in stark contrast to Apple's commitment to privacy, while also highlighting a pattern of&nbsp; conceding &nbsp;to the&nbsp; demands &nbsp;of the Chinese government in order to continue its operations in the country.   Apple, in 2018, announced iCloud data of users in mainland China would move to a new data center in Guizhou province as part of a partnership with GCBD. The transitio

An unknown threat actor managed to control more than 27% of the entire Tor network exit capacity in early February 2021, a new study on the dark web infrastructure revealed.  "The entity attacking Tor users is actively exploiting tor users since over a year and expanded the scale of their attacks to a new record level," an independent security researcher who goes by the name nusenu&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published on Sunday. "The average exit fraction this entity controlled was above 14% throughout the past 12 months."  It's the latest in a series of efforts undertaken to bring to light malicious Tor activity since&nbsp; December 2019 . The attacks, which are said to have begun in January 2020, were first&nbsp; documented and exposed &nbsp;by the same researcher in August 2020.   Tor is open-source software for enabling anonymous communication on the Internet. It obfuscates the source and destination of a web request by directing network traffic through a series of relays in or

WhatsApp on Friday disclosed that it won't deactivate accounts of users who don't accept its&nbsp; new privacy policy &nbsp;rolling out on May 15, adding it will continue to keep reminding them to accept the new terms.  "No one will have their accounts deleted or lose functionality of WhatsApp on May 15 because of this update," the Facebook-owned messaging service&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement.  The move marks a turnaround from its previous stance earlier this year when the company outlined plans to make the accounts inaccessible completely should users choose not to comply with the data-sharing agreement and opt not to have their WhatsApp account information shared with Facebook.   "If you haven't accepted by [May 15], WhatsApp will not delete your account. However, you won't have full functionality of WhatsApp until you accept," the company had&nbsp; previously said .

Researchers have discovered a new information-stealing trojan, which targets Android devices with an onslaught of data-exfiltration capabilities — from collecting browser searches to recording audio and phone calls.  While malware on Android has previously taken the guise of copycat apps, which go under names similar to legitimate pieces of software, this sophisticated new malicious app masquerades itself as a System Update application to take control of compromised devices.  "The spyware creates a notification if the device's screen is off when it receives a command using the Firebase messaging service," Zimperium researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Friday analysis. "The 'Searching for update..' is not a legitimate notification from the operating system, but the spyware."   Once installed, the sophisticated spyware campaign sets about its task by registering the device with a Firebase command-and-control (C2) server with information such as battery percentage, sto

Privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo called out rival Google for "spying" on users after the search giant updated its flagship app to spell out the exact kinds of information it collects for personalization and marketing purposes.  "After months of stalling, Google finally revealed how much personal data they collect in Chrome and the Google app. No wonder they wanted to hide it," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a tweet. "Spying on users has nothing to do with building a great web browser or search engine."  The " privacy nutrition labels " are part of a new policy that&nbsp; went into effect &nbsp;on December 8, 2020, mandating app developers to disclose their data collection practices and help users understand how their personal information is put to use.  The insinuation from DuckDuckGo comes as Google has been steadily adding app privacy labels to its iOS apps over the course of the last several weeks in accordance with Apple's App Store rules, but not

Signaling a major shift to its ads-driven business model, Google on Wednesday unequivocally stated it would not build alternate identifiers or tools to track users across multiple websites once it begins phasing out third-party tracking cookies from its Chrome browser by early 2022.  "Instead, our web products will be powered by privacy-preserving APIs which prevent individual tracking while still delivering results for advertisers and publishers,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;David Temkin, Google's director of product management for ads privacy and trust.  "Advances in aggregation, anonymization, on-device processing and other privacy-preserving technologies offer a clear path to replacing individual identifiers."  The changes, which could potentially reshape the advertising landscape, are expected only to cover websites visited via Chrome and do not extend to mobile apps.  At the same time, Google acknowledged that other companies might find alternative ways to track individual us

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
With browser makers steadily clamping down on third-party tracking, advertising technology companies are increasingly embracing a DNS technique to evade such defenses, thereby posing a threat to web security and privacy.  Called&nbsp; CNAME Cloaking , the practice of blurring the distinction between first-party and third-party cookies not only results in leaking sensitive private information without users' knowledge and consent but also "increases [the] web security threat surface," said a group of researchers Yana Dimova, Gunes Acar, Lukasz Olejnik, Wouter Joosen, and Tom Van Goethem in the latest research.  "This tracking scheme takes advantage of a CNAME record on a subdomain such that it is same-site to the including web site," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in the paper. "As such, defenses that block third-party cookies are rendered ineffective."  The findings are expected to be presented in July at the 21st Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2021

A new attack framework aims to infer keystrokes typed by a target user at the opposite end of a video conference call by simply leveraging the video feed to correlate observable body movements to the text being typed.  The research was undertaken by Mohd Sabra, and Murtuza Jadliwala from the University of Texas at San Antonio and Anindya Maiti from the University of Oklahoma, who say the attack can be extended beyond live video feeds to those streamed on YouTube and Twitch as long as a webcam's field-of-view captures the target user's visible upper body movements.  "With the recent ubiquity of video capturing hardware embedded in many consumer electronics, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, the threat of information leakage through visual channel[s] has amplified," the researchers&nbsp; said . "The adversary's goal is to utilize the observable upper body movements across all the recorded frames to infer the private text typed by the target."   To ach

Privacy Bug in Brave Browser Exposes Dark-Web Browsing History of Its Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/privacy-bug-in-brave-browser-exposes.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Brave has fixed a privacy issue in its browser that sent queries for .onion domains to public internet DNS resolvers rather than routing them through Tor nodes, thus exposing users' visits to dark web websites.  The bug was addressed in a hotfix&nbsp; release &nbsp;(V1.20.108) made available yesterday.  Brave ships with a built-in feature called " Private Window with Tor " that integrates the&nbsp; Tor &nbsp;anonymity network into the browser, allowing users to access .onion websites, which are hosted on the darknet, without revealing the IP address information to internet service providers (ISPs), Wi-Fi network providers, and the websites themselves. The feature was added in&nbsp; June 2018 .   This is achieved by relaying users' requests for an onion URL through a network of volunteer-run Tor nodes. At the same time, it's worth noting that the feature uses Tor just as a proxy and does not implement most of the privacy protections offered by Tor Browser.  But according to a report first

Apple's upcoming iOS 14.5 update will come with a new feature that will redirect all fraudulent website checks through its own proxy servers as a workaround to preserve user privacy and prevent leaking IP addresses to Google.  A built-in security-focused feature in the Safari browser, " Fraudulent Website Warning ," alerts users about dangerous websites that have been reported as deceptive, malicious, or harmful.  To achieve this, Apple relies on&nbsp; Google Safe Browsing &nbsp;— or Tencent Safe Browsing for users in Mainland China — a blocklist service that provides a list of URLs for web resources that contain malware or phishing content, to compare a hash prefix calculated from the website address and check if the website is fraudulent.   Any match against the database will prompt Safari to request Google or Tencent for the full list of URLs that match the hashed prefix and subsequently block the user's access to the site with a warning.  While the approach ensures that th

WhatsApp Delays Controversial 'Data-Sharing' Privacy Policy Update By 3 Months<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/whatsapp-delays-controversial-data.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WhatsApp said on Friday that it wouldn't enforce its recently announced&nbsp; controversial data sharing policy &nbsp;update&nbsp;until May 15.  Originally set to go into effect next month on February 8, the three-month delay comes following "a lot of misinformation" about a revision to its privacy policy that allows WhatsApp to share data with Facebook, sparking widespread concerns about the exact kind of information that will be shared under the incoming terms.  The Facebook-owned company has since repeatedly clarified that the update does not expand its ability to share personal user chats or other profile information with Facebook and is instead simply providing further transparency about how user data is collected and shared when using the messaging app to interact with businesses.   "The update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data," WhatsApp&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post.  "W

<details>

Cybersecurity researchers took the wraps off a new spyware operation targeting users in Pakistan that leverages trojanized versions of legitimate Android apps to carry out covert surveillance and espionage.  Designed to masquerade apps such as the Pakistan Citizen Porta l, a Muslim prayer-clock app called Pakistan Salat Time , Mobile Packages Pakistan , Registered SIMs Checker , and TPL Insurance , the malicious variants have been found to obfuscate their operations to stealthily download a payload in the form of an Android Dalvik executable (DEX) file.  "The DEX payload contains most of the malicious features, which include the ability to covertly exfiltrate sensitive data like the user's contact list and the full contents of SMS messages," Sophos  threat researchers Pankaj Kohli and Andrew Brandt said.  "The app then sends this information to one of a small number of command-and-control websites hosted on servers located in eastern Europe."   Interestingly, t
