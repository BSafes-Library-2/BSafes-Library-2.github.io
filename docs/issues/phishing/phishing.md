Hackers Using Vishing to Trick Victims into Installing Android Banking Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/hackers-using-vishing-tactics-to-trick.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors are resorting to voice phishing (vishing) tactics to dupe victims into installing Android malware on their devices, new research  from ThreatFabric reveals.  The Dutch mobile security company said it identified a network of phishing websites targeting Italian online-banking users that are designed to get hold of their contact details.  Telephone-oriented attack delivery (TOAD), as the social engineering technique is called, involves calling the victims using previously collected information from fraudulent websites.  The caller, who purports to be a support agent for the bank, instructs the individual, on the other hand, to install a security app and grant it extensive permissions, when, in reality, it's malicious software intended to gain remote access or conduct financial fraud.   In this case, it leads to the deployment of an Android malware dubbed&nbsp; Copybara , a mobile trojan first detected in November 2021 and is primarily used to perform on-device fraud via o

BazarCall Callback Phishing Attacks Constantly Evolving Its Social Engineering Tactics<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/bazarcall-callback-phishing-attacks.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind the BazaCall call back phishing method have continued to evolve with updated social engineering tactics to deploy malware on targeted networks.  The scheme eventually acts as an entry point to conduct financial fraud or the delivery of next-stage payloads such as ransomware, cybersecurity company Trellix&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.  Primary targets of the latest attack waves include the U.S., Canada, China, India, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and the U.K.   BazaCall , also called BazarCall, first gained popularity in 2020 for its novel approach of distributing the BazarBackdoor (aka BazarLoader) malware by manipulating potential victims into calling a phone number specified in decoy email messages.  These email baits aim to create a false sense of urgency, informing the recipients about renewal of a trial subscription for, say, an antivirus service. The messages also urge them to contact their support desk to cancel the plan, or risk getting automat

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cyber criminals are using a previously undocumented phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit called&nbsp; Caffeine &nbsp;to effectively scale up their attacks and distribute nefarious payloads.  "This platform has an intuitive interface and comes at a relatively low cost while providing a multitude of features and tools to its criminal clients to orchestrate and automate core elements of their phishing campaigns," Mandiant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.  Some of the core features offered by the platform comprise the ability to craft customized phishing kits, manage redirect pages, dynamically generate URLs that host the payloads, and track the success of the campaigns.   The development comes a little over a month after Resecurity took the wraps off another PhaaS service dubbed&nbsp; EvilProxy &nbsp;that's offered for sale on dark web criminal forums.  But unlike EvilProxy, whose operators are known to vet prospective customers before activating the subscriptions, Caffeine is notable for running an o

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A popular Chinese-language YouTube channel has emerged as a means to distribute a trojanized version of a Windows installer for the Tor Browser.  Kaspersky&nbsp; dubbed &nbsp;the campaign&nbsp; OnionPoison , with all of the victims located in China. The scale of the attack remains unclear, but the Russian cybersecurity company said it detected victims appearing in its telemetry in March 2022.  The malicious version of the Tor Browser installer is being distributed via a link present in the description of a video that was uploaded to YouTube on January 9, 2022. It has been viewed over 64,500 times to date.   The channel hosting the video has 181,000 subscribers and claims to be based in Hong Kong. The video is still available to watch on the social media platform as of writing.  The attack banks on the fact that the actual Tor Browser website is blocked in China, thus tricking unsuspecting users searching for "Tor浏览器" (i.e., Tor Browser in Chinese) on YouTube into potentially downloading th

GitHub has put out an advisory detailing what may be an ongoing phishing campaign targeting its users to steal credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes by impersonating the CircleCI DevOps platform.  The Microsoft-owned code hosting service said it learned of the attack on September 16, 2022, adding the campaign impacted "many victim organizations."  The fraudulent messages claim to notify users that their CircleCI sessions have expired and that they should log in using GitHub credentials by clicking on a link.   Another bogus email&nbsp; revealed by CircleCI &nbsp;prompts users to sign in to their GitHub accounts to accept the company's new Terms of Use and Privacy Policy by following the link embedded in the message.  Regardless of the lure, doing so redirects the target to a lookalike GitHub login page designed to steal and exfiltrate the entered credentials as well as the Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) codes in real-time to the attacker, effectively allowing

Microsoft Warns of Large-Scale Click Fraud Campaign Targeting Gamers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/microsoft-warns-of-large-scale-click.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft said it's tracking an ongoing large-scale click fraud campaign targeting gamers by means of stealthily deployed browser extensions on compromised systems.  "[The] attackers monetize clicks generated by a browser node-webkit or malicious browser extension secretly installed on devices," Microsoft Security Intelligence said  in a sequence of tweets over the weekend.  The tech giant's cybersecurity division is tracking the developing threat cluster under the name DEV-0796.

New EvilProxy Phishing Service Allowing Cybercriminals to Bypass 2-Factor Security<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/new-evilproxy-phishing-service-allowing.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit dubbed EvilProxy is being advertised on the criminal underground as a means for threat actors to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) protections employed against online services.  "EvilProxy actors are using reverse proxy and cookie injection methods to bypass 2FA authentication – proxifying victim's session," Resecurity researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday write-up.   The platform generates phishing links that are nothing but cloned pages designed to compromise user accounts associated with Apple iCloud, Facebook, GoDaddy, GitHub, Google, Dropbox, Instagram, Microsoft, NPM, PyPI, RubyGems, Twitter, Yahoo, and Yandex, among others.  EvilProxy is similar to adversary-in-the-middle ( AiTM ) attacks in that users interact with a malicious proxy server that acts as a&nbsp;go-between for the target website, covertly harvesting the credentials and 2FA passcodes entered in the login pages.  It's offered on a subscription basis per service

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More details have emerged about the operators behind the&nbsp; first-known phishing campaign &nbsp;specifically aimed at the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official third-party software repository for the programming language.  Connecting it to a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; JuiceLedger , cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, along with Checkmarx, described the group as a relatively new entity that surfaced in early 2022.  Initial "low-key" campaigns are said to have involved the use of rogue Python installer applications to deliver a .NET-based malware called JuiceStealer that's engineered to siphon passwords and other sensitive data from victims' web browsers.   The attacks received a significant facelift last month when the JuiceLedger actors&nbsp; targeted PyPi package contributors &nbsp;in a phishing campaign, resulting in the compromise of three packages with malware.

"This is the first known phishing attack against PyPI," the maintainers of the official third-party software repository&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets.  The social engineering attack entails sending security-themed messages that create a false sense of urgency by informing recipients that Google is implementing a mandatory validation process on all packages and that they need to click on a link to complete the validation before September, or risk getting their PyPI modules removed.   Should an unsuspecting developer fall for the scheme, users are directed to a lookalike landing page that mimics PyPI's login page and is hosted on Google Sites, from where the entered credentials are captured and abused to unauthorizedly access the accounts and compromise the packages to include malware

Microsoft Warns About Phishing Attacks by Russia-linked Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/microsoft-warns-about-phishing-attacks.html"> Full Text</a>

Microsoft on Monday revealed it took steps to disrupt phishing operations undertaken by a "highly persistent threat actor" whose objectives align closely with Russian state interests.  The company is tracking the espionage-oriented activity cluster under its chemical element-themed moniker&nbsp; SEABORGIUM , which it said overlaps with a hacking group also known as&nbsp; Callisto ,&nbsp; COLDRIVER , and TA446.  "SEABORGIUM intrusions have also been linked to hack-and-leak campaigns, where stolen and leaked data is used to shape narratives in targeted countries," Microsoft's threat hunting teams&nbsp; said . "Its campaigns involve persistent phishing and credential theft campaigns leading to intrusions and data theft."   Attacks launched by the adversarial collective are known to target the same organizations using consistent methodologies applied over long periods of time, enabling it to infiltrate the victims' social networks through a combination of impersonation,

A sophisticated scam-as-a-service operation dubbed Classiscam  has now infiltrated into Singapore, more than 1.5 years after&nbsp; expanding to Europe .  "Scammers posing as legitimate buyers approach sellers with the request to purchase goods from their listings and the ultimate aim of stealing payment data," Group-IB&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The cybersecurity firm called the operators a "well-coordinated and technologically advanced scammer criminal network."  Classiscam refers to a&nbsp; Russia-based cybercrime operation &nbsp;that was first recorded in summer 2019 but only came under spotlight a year later coinciding with a surge in activity owing to an increase in online shopping in the aftermath of COVID-19 outbreak.  Called the&nbsp; most widely used fraud scheme &nbsp;during the pandemic, Classiscam targets people who use marketplaces and services relating to property rentals, hotel bookings, online bank transfers, online retail, ride-sharing, and package de

Researchers Warns of Increase in Phishing Attacks Using Decentralized IPFS Network<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/researchers-warns-of-increase-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The decentralized file system solution known as IPFS is becoming the new "hotbed" for hosting phishing sites, researchers have warned.  Cybersecurity firm Trustwave SpiderLabs, which disclosed specifics of the attack campaigns, said it identified no less than 3,000 emails containing IPFS phishing URLs as an attack vector in the last three months.  IPFS , short for InterPlanetary File System, is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to store and share files and data using cryptographic hashes, instead of URLs or filenames, as is observed in a traditional client-server approach. Each hash forms the basis for a unique content identifier ( CID ).  The idea is to create a resilient distributed file system that allows data to be stored across multiple computers. This would allow information to be accessed without having to rely on third parties such as cloud storage providers, effectively making it resistant to censorship.   "Taking down phishing content stored on IPFS can be difficul

Microsoft Warns of Large-Scale AiTM Phishing Attacks Against Over 10,000 Organizations<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/microsoft-warns-of-large-scale-aitm.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Tuesday disclosed that a large-scale phishing campaign targeted over 10,000 organizations since September 2021 by hijacking Office 365's authentication process even on accounts secured with multi-factor authentication (MFA).  "The attackers then used the stolen credentials and session cookies to access affected users' mailboxes and perform follow-on business email compromise (BEC) campaigns against other targets," the company's cybersecurity teams&nbsp; reported .  The intrusions entailed setting up adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing sites, wherein the adversary deploys a proxy server between a potential victim and the targeted website so that recipients of a phishing email are redirected to lookalike landing pages designed to capture credentials and MFA information.  "The phishing page has two different Transport Layer Security (TLS) sessions — one with the target and another with the actual website the target wants to access," the company

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly observed phishing campaign is leveraging the recently disclosed Follina security vulnerability to distribute a previously undocumented backdoor on Windows systems.  "Rozena is a backdoor malware that is capable of injecting a remote shell connection back to the attacker's machine," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report this week.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-30190 , the now-patched Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) remote code execution vulnerability has come under heavy exploitation in recent weeks ever since it came to light in late May 2022.  The starting point for the latest attack chain observed by Fortinet is a weaponized&nbsp; Office document &nbsp;that, when opened, connects to a&nbsp; Discord CDN URL &nbsp;to retrieve an HTML file (" index.htm ") that, in turn, invokes the diagnostic utility using a PowerShell command to download next-stage payloads from the same CDN attachment space.   This includes the Rozena implant ("Word

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new email phishing campaign has been spotted leveraging the tactic of conversation hijacking to deliver the IcedID info-stealing malware  onto infected&nbsp;machines by making use of unpatched and publicly-exposed Microsoft Exchange servers.  "The emails use a social engineering technique of conversation hijacking (also known as thread hijacking)," Israeli company Intezer said in a report  shared with The Hacker News. "A forged reply to a previous stolen email is being used as a way to convince the recipient to open the attachment. This is notable because it increases the credibility of the phishing email and may cause a high infection rate."  The latest wave of attacks, detected in mid-March 2022, is said to have targeted organizations within energy, healthcare, law, and pharmaceutical sectors.   IcedID, aka BokBot, like its counterparts TrickBot and&nbsp; Emotet , is a&nbsp; banking trojan &nbsp;that has evolved to become an entry point for more sophisticated threats, including hu

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A novel phishing technique called browser-in-the-browser (BitB) attack can be exploited to simulate a browser window within the browser in order to spoof a legitimate domain, thereby making it possible to stage convincing phishing attacks.  According to penetration tester and security researcher, who goes by the handle mrd0x_, the method takes advantage of third-party single sign-on ( SSO ) options embedded on websites such as "Sign in with Google" (or Facebook, Apple, or Microsoft).   While the default behavior when a user attempts to sign in via these methods is to be greeted by a pop-up window to complete the authentication process, the BitB attack aims to replicate this entire process using a mix of HTML and CSS code to create an entirely fabricated browser window.   "Combine the window design with an iframe pointing to the malicious server hosting the phishing page, and it's basically indistinguishable," mrd0x_&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published last

Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) warned of new phishing attacks aimed at its citizens by leveraging compromised email accounts belonging to three different Indian entities with the goal of compromising their inboxes and stealing sensitive information.  The agency&nbsp; cautioned &nbsp;that the emails arrive with the subject line "Увага" (meaning "Attention") and claim to be from a domestic email service called Ukr.net, when in actuality, the email address of the sender is "muthuprakash.b@tvsrubber[.]com."  The messages purportedly warn the recipients of an unauthorized attempt to log in to their accounts from an IP address based out of the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, further prompting them to click on a link to change their passwords with immediate effect.

Microsoft has warned of emerging threats in the&nbsp; Web3 &nbsp;landscape, including "ice phishing" campaigns, as a surge in adoption of blockchain and DeFi technologies emphasizes the need to build security into the decentralized web while it's still in its early stages.

"One aspect that the immutable and public blockchain enables is complete transparency, so an attack can be observed and studied after it occurred," Christian Seifert, principal research manager at Microsoft's Security and Compliance group,&nbsp; said . "It also allows assessment of the financial impact of attacks, which is challenging in traditional web2 phishing attacks."  The theft of the keys could be carried out in several ways, including im

No fewer than 1,220 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) phishing websites have been discovered as targeting popular online services like Instagram, Google, PayPal, Apple, Twitter, and LinkedIn with the goal of hijacking users' credentials and carrying out further follow-on attacks.  The findings come from a&nbsp; new study &nbsp;undertaken by a group of researchers from Stony Brook University and Palo Alto Networks, who have demonstrated a new fingerprinting technique that makes it possible to identify MitM phishing kits in the wild by leveraging their intrinsic network-level properties, effectively automating the discovery and analysis of phishing websites.  Dubbed " PHOCA " — named after the Latin word for "seals" — the tool not only facilitates the discovery of previously unseen MitM phishing toolkits, but also be used to detect and isolate malicious requests coming from such servers.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing malicious campaign that employs phony call centers has been found to trick victims into downloading malware capable of data exfiltration as well as deploying ransomware on infected systems.  The attacks — dubbed "BazaCall" — eschew traditional social engineering techniques that rely on rogue URLs and malware-laced documents in favor of a vishing-like method wherein targeted users are sent email messages informing them of a forthcoming subscription charge unless they call a specific phone number.  By tricking the recipients into calling the number, the unsuspecting victims are connected with an actual human operator at a fraudulent call center, who then provide them with instructions to download the BazaLoader malware.   BazaLoader&nbsp;(aka BazarBackdoor) is a C++-based downloader with the ability to install various types of malicious programs on infected computers, including deploying ransomware and other malware to steal sensitive data from victimized systems.

Law enforcement officials in Ukraine, in coordination with authorities from the U.S. and Australia, last week shut down one of the world's largest phishing services that were used to attack financial institutions in 11 countries, causing tens of millions of dollars in losses.  The Ukrainian attorney general's office&nbsp; said &nbsp;it worked with the National Police and its Main Investigation Department to identify a 39-year-old man from the Ternopil region who developed a phishing package and a special administrative panel for the service, which were then aimed at several banks located in Australia, Spain, the U.S., Italy, Chile, the Netherlands, Mexico, France, Switzerland, Germany, and the U.K.   Computer equipment, mobile phones, and hard drives were seized as part of five authorized searches conducted during the course of the operation.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An evolving phishing campaign observed at least since May 2020 has been found to target high-ranking company executives across manufacturing, real estate, finance, government, and technological sectors with the goal of obtaining sensitive information.  The campaign hinges on a social engineering trick that involves sending emails to potential victims containing fake Office 365 password expiration notifications as lures. The messages also include an embedded link to retain the same password that, when clicked, redirects users to a phishing page for credential harvesting.  "The attackers target high profile employees who may not be as technically or cybersecurity savvy, and may be more likely to be deceived into clicking on malicious links," Trend Micro researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday analysis.   "By selectively targeting C-level employees, the attacker significantly increases the value of obtained credentials as they could lead to further access to sensitive personal and
