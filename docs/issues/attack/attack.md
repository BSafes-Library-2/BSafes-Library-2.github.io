Two long-running surveillance campaigns have been found targeting the Uyghur community in China and elsewhere with Android spyware tools designed to harvest sensitive information and track their whereabouts.  This encompasses a previously undocumented malware strain called BadBazaar and updated variants of an espionage artifact dubbed&nbsp; MOONSHINE &nbsp;by researchers from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in September 2019.  "Mobile surveillance tools like BadBazaar and MOONSHINE can be used to track many of the 'pre-criminal' activities, actions considered indicative of religious extremism or separatism by the authorities in Xinjiang," Lookout&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a detailed write-up of the operations.  The BadBazaar campaign, according to the security firm, is said to date as far back as late 2018 and comprise 111 unique apps that masquerade as benign video players, messengers, religious apps, and even TikTok.

Microsoft on Thursday attributed the recent spate of ransomware incidents targeting transportation and logistics sectors in Ukraine and Poland to a threat cluster that shares overlaps with the Russian state-sponsored&nbsp; Sandworm group .  The attacks, which were disclosed by the tech giant last month, involved a strain of previously undocumented malware called&nbsp; Prestige &nbsp;and is said to have taken place within an hour of each other across all victims.  The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) is now tracking the threat actor under its element-themed moniker Iridium (née DEV-0960), citing overlaps with Sandworm (aka Iron Viking, TeleBots, and Voodoo Bear).  "This attribution assessment is based on forensic artifacts, as well as overlaps in victimology, tradecraft, capabilities, and infrastructure, with known Iridium activity," MSTIC&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an update.

Warning: New Massive Malicious Campaigns Targeting Top Indian Banks' Customers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/warning-this-widespread-malicious.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are warning of "massive phishing campaigns" that distribute five different malware targeting banking users in India.  "The bank customers targeted include account subscribers of seven banks, including some of the most well-known banks located in the country and potentially affecting millions of customers," Trend Micro&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week.  Some of the targeted banks include Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, and the State Bank of India (SBI), among others.  The infection chains all have a common entry point in that they rely on SMS messages containing a phishing link that urge potential victims to enter their personal details and credit card information to supposedly get a tax refund or gain credit card reward points.   The smishing attacks, which deliver Elibomi, FakeReward, AxBanker, IcRAT, and IcSpy, are just the latest in a series of similar rewards-themed malware campaigns that have been documented by&nbsp; Microsoft, Cyble , and&nbsp; K

Several Cyber Attacks Observed Leveraging IPFS Decentralized Network<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/several-cyber-attacks-observed.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A number of phishing campaigns are leveraging the decentralized Interplanetary Filesystem (IPFS) network to host malware, phishing kit infrastructure, and facilitate other attacks.  "Multiple malware families are currently being hosted within IPFS and retrieved during the initial stages of malware attacks," Cisco Talos researcher Edmund Brumaghin said in an analysis  shared with The Hacker News.  The research mirrors similar findings from Trustwave SpiderLabs in July 2022, which&nbsp; found &nbsp;more than 3,000 emails containing IPFS phishing URLs as an attack vector, calling IPFS the new "hotbed" for hosting phishing sites.  IPFS as a technology is both resilient to censorship and takedowns, making it a double-edged sword. Underlying it is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network which replicates content across all participating nodes so that even if content is removed from one machine, requests for the resources can still be served via other systems.   This also makes it ripe for abu

An advanced persistent threat (APT) group of Chinese origin codenamed&nbsp; DiceyF &nbsp;has been linked to a string of attacks aimed at online casinos in Southeast Asia for years.

"Possibly we have a mix of espionage and [intellectual property] theft, but the true motivations remain a mystery," researchers Kurt Baumgartner and Georgy Kucherin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published this week.  The starting point of the investigation was in November 2021 when Kaspersky said it detected multiple&nbsp; PlugX loaders &nbsp;and other payloads that were deployed via an employee monitoring service and a security package deployment service.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Tata Power Company Limited, India's largest integrated power company, on Friday confirmed it was targeted by a cyberattack.  The intrusion on IT infrastructure impacted "some of its IT systems," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a filing with the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India.   It further said it has taken steps to retrieve and restore the affected machines, adding it put in place security guardrails for customer-facing portals to prevent unauthorized access.  The Mumbai-based electric utility company, part of the Tata Group conglomerate, did not disclose any further details about the nature of the attack, or when it took place.  That said, cybersecurity firm Recorded Future in April&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;attacks mounted by China-linked adversaries targeting Indian power grid organizations.  The network intrusions are said to have been aimed at "at least seven Indian State Load Despatch Centres (SLDCs) responsible for carrying out real-time operations for grid control and elect

New Report Uncovers Emotet's Delivery and Evasion Techniques Used in Recent Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/new-report-uncovers-emotets-delivery.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the notorious Emotet malware are continually shifting their tactics and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to escape detection, according to new research from VMware.  Emotet &nbsp;is the work of a threat actor tracked as Mummy Spider (aka TA542), emerging in June 2014 as a banking trojan before morphing into an all-purpose loader in 2016 that's capable of delivering second-stage payloads such as ransomware.  While the botnet's infrastructure was&nbsp; taken down &nbsp;as part of a coordinated law enforcement operation in January 2021, Emotet bounced back in November 2021 through another malware known as&nbsp; TrickBot .  Emotet's resurrection, orchestrated by the now-defunct Conti team, has since paved the way for Cobalt Strike infections and, more recently, ransomware attacks involving&nbsp; Quantum and BlackCat .   "The ongoing adaptation of Emotet's execution chain is one reason the malware has been successful for so long," researchers from VMwa

A threat actor likely with associations to China has been attributed to a new supply chain attack that involves the use of a trojanized installer for the Comm100 Live Chat application to distribute a JavaScript backdoor.  Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said the attack made use of a signed Comm100 desktop agent app for Windows that was downloadable from the company's website.  The scale of the attack is currently unknown, but the trojanized file is said to have been identified at organizations in the industrial, healthcare, technology, manufacturing, insurance, and telecom sectors in North America and Europe.  Comm100 is a Canadian provider of live audio/video chat and customer engagement software for enterprises. It&nbsp; claims &nbsp;to have more than 15,000 customers across 51 countries.   "The installer was signed on September 26, 2022 at 14:54:00 UTC using a valid Comm100 Network Corporation certificate," the company&nbsp; noted , adding it remained available until September 29.  E

Cyber Attacks Against Middle East Governments Hide Malware in Windows logo<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/cyber-attacks-against-middle-east.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An espionage-focused threat actor has been observed using a steganographic trick to conceal a previously undocumented backdoor in a Windows logo in its attacks against Middle Eastern governments.  Broadcom's Symantec Threat Hunter Team attributed the updated tooling to a hacking group it tracks under the name&nbsp; Witchetty , which is also known as&nbsp; LookingFrog , a subgroup operating under the TA410 umbrella.  Intrusions involving TA410 – which is believed to share connections with a Chinese threat group known as APT10 (aka Cicada, Stone Panda, or TA429) – primarily feature a modular implant called LookBack.   Symantec's latest analysis of attacks between February and September 2022, during which the group targeted the governments of two Middle Eastern countries and the stock exchange of an African nation, highlights the use of a new backdoor called Stegmap.  The new malware leverages&nbsp; steganography &nbsp;– a technique used to embed a message (in this case, malware) in a non-secret doc

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers are warning of previously undisclosed flaws in fully patched Microsoft Exchange servers being exploited by malicious actors in real-world attacks to achieve remote code execution on affected systems.  That's according to Vietnamese cybersecurity company GTSC, which discovered the shortcomings as part of its security monitoring and incident response efforts in August 2022.  The two vulnerabilities, which are formally yet to be assigned CVE identifiers, are being&nbsp; tracked &nbsp;by the Zero Day Initiative as&nbsp; ZDI-CAN-18333 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8) and&nbsp; ZDI-CAN-18802 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.3).  GTSC said that successful exploitation of the flaws could be abused to gain a foothold in the victim's systems, enabling adversaries to drop web shells and carry out lateral movements across the compromised network.   "We detected web shells, mostly obfuscated, being dropped to Exchange servers," the company&nbsp; noted . "Using the user-agent, we detected that the attacker use

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new covert attack campaign singled out multiple military and weapons contractor companies with spear-phishing emails to trigger a multi-stage infection process designed to deploy an unknown payload on compromised machines.  The highly-targeted intrusions, dubbed&nbsp; STEEP#MAVERICK &nbsp;by Securonix, also targeted a strategic supplier to the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft.  "The attack was carried out starting in late summer 2022 targeting at least two high-profile military contractor companies," Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis.   Infection chains begin with a phishing mail with a ZIP archive attachment containing a shortcut file that claims to be a PDF document about "Company &amp; Benefits," which is then used to retrieve a stager -- an initial binary that's used to download the desired malware -- from a remote server.  This PowerShell stager sets the stage for a "robust chain of stagers" that progresses through seven m

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government and state-owned organizations in a number of Asian countries have been targeted by a distinct group of espionage hackers as part of an intelligence gathering mission that has been underway since early 2021.  "A notable feature of these attacks is that the attackers leveraged a wide range of legitimate software packages in order to load their malware payloads using a technique known as&nbsp; DLL side-loading ," the Symantec Threat Hunter team, part of Broadcom Software,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The campaign is said to be exclusively geared towards government institutions related to finance, aerospace, and defense, as well as state-owned media, IT, and telecom firms.&nbsp;  Dynamic-link library (DLL) side-loading is a popular cyberattack method that leverages how Microsoft Windows applications handle DLL files. In these intrusions, a spoofed malicious DLL is planted in the Windows Side-by-Side ( WinSxS ) directory so that the operating system loads it

Cybersecurity firm Sentire, which&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;the findings, raised the possibility that the intrusions could be the work of a criminal actor known as mx1r, who is said to be a member of the Evil Corp affiliate cluster dubbed&nbsp; UNC2165 .  Evil Corp, the progenitors of the infamous Dridex banking trojan, have, over the years, refined their modus operandi to run a series of ransomware operations to sidestep sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury in December 2019.   Initial access to the company's IT network was made possible by using stolen Virtual Private Network (VPN) credentials, followed by leveraging off-the-shelf tools for lateral movement and gaining deeper access into the victim's environment.  "Using Cobalt Strike, the attackers were able to gain an init

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A months-long cyber espionage campaign undertaken by a Chinese nation-state group targeted several entities with reconnaissance malware so as to glean information about its victims and meet its strategic goals.  "The targets of this recent campaign spanned Australia, Malaysia, and Europe, as well as entities that operate in the South China Sea," enterprise security firm Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a published in partnership with PwC.  Targets encompass local and federal Australian Governmental agencies, Australian news media companies, and global heavy industry manufacturers which conduct maintenance of fleets of wind turbines in the South China Sea.  Proofpoint and PwC attributed the intrusions with moderate confidence to a threat actor tracked by the two companies under the names TA423 and Red Ladon respectively, which is also known as APT40 and Leviathan.  APT40 is the name designated to a China-based, espionage-motivated threat actor that's known to be active since 2013 and

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have elaborated a novel attack technique that weaponizes programmable logic controllers ( PLCs ) to gain an initial foothold in engineering workstations and subsequently invade the operational technology (OT) networks.  Dubbed " Evil PLC " attack by industrial security firm Claroty, the issue impacts engineering workstation software from Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric, GE, B&amp;R, Xinje, OVARRO, and Emerson.  Programmable logic controllers are a crucial component of industrial devices that control manufacturing processes in critical infrastructure sectors. PLCs, besides orchestrating the automation tasks, are also configured to start and stop processes and generate alarms.  It's hence not surprising that the entrenched access provided by PLCs have made the machines a focus of sophisticated attacks for more than a decade, starting from&nbsp; Stuxnet to PIPEDREAM &nbsp;(aka INCONTROLLER), with the goal of causing physical disruptions.&nbsp;   "The

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Russian state-sponsored actors are continuing to strike Ukrainian entities with information-stealing malware as part of what's suspected to be an espionage operation.  Symantec, a division of Broadcom Software,&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the malicious campaign to a threat actor tracked&nbsp; Shuckworm , also known as&nbsp; Actinium ,&nbsp; Armageddon , Gamaredon, Primitive Bear, and Trident Ursa. The findings have been&nbsp; corroborated &nbsp;by the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA).  The threat actor, active since at least 2013, is known for explicitly singling out public and private entities in Ukraine. The attacks have since ratcheted up in the wake of Russia's military invasion in late 2022.   The latest set of attacks are said to have commenced on July 15, 2022, and ongoing as recently as August 8, with the infection chains leveraging phishing emails disguised as newsletters and combat orders, ultimately leading to the deployment of a PowerShell stealer malware dubbed&nbsp; GammaLoad.PS1_v2 .

Networking equipment major Cisco on Wednesday confirmed it was the victim of a cyberattack on May 24, 2022 after the attackers got hold of an employee's personal Google account that contained passwords synced from their web browser.  "Initial access to the Cisco VPN was achieved via the successful compromise of a Cisco employee's personal Google account," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a detailed write-up. "The user had enabled password syncing via Google Chrome and had stored their Cisco credentials in their browser, enabling that information to synchronize to their Google account."  The disclosure comes as cybercriminal actors associated with the Yanluowang ransomware gang&nbsp; published a list of files &nbsp;from the breach to their data leak site on August 10.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the Cuba ransomware have been linked to previously undocumented tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), including a new remote access trojan called ROMCOM RAT  on compromised systems.  The&nbsp; new findings &nbsp;come from Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team, which is tracking the double extortion ransomware group under the&nbsp; constellation-themed moniker &nbsp; Tropical Scorpius .  Cuba ransomware (aka&nbsp; COLDDRAW ), which was first detected in December 2019, reemerged on the threat landscape in November 2021 and has been attributed to attacks against 60 entities in five critical infrastructure sectors, amassing at least $43.9 million in ransom payments.  Of the 60 victims listed on its data leak site, 40 are located in the U.S., indicating a not as global distribution of targeted organizations as other ransomware gangs.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The first ever incident possibly involving the ransomware family known as Maui occurred on April 15, 2021, aimed at an unnamed Japanese housing company.  The disclosure from Kaspersky arrives a month after U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies issued an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;about the use of the ransomware strain by North Korean government-backed hackers to target the healthcare sector since at least May 2021.  Much of the data about its modus operandi came from incident response activities and industry analysis of a Maui sample that revealed a lack of "several key features" typically associated with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations.  Not only is Maui designed to be manually executed by a remote actor via a command-line interface, it's also notable for not including a ransom note to provide recovery instructions.   Subsequently, the Justice Department&nbsp; announced &nbsp;the seizure of $500,000 worth of Bitcoin that were extorted from several organizations, including two he

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor working to further Iranian goals is said to have been behind a set of disruptive cyberattacks against Albanian government services in mid-July 2022.  Cybersecurity firm Mandiant&nbsp; said &nbsp;the malicious activity against a NATO state represented a "geographic expansion of Iranian disruptive cyber operations."  The&nbsp; July 17 attacks , according to Albania's National Agency of Information Society, forced the government to "temporarily close access to online public services and other government websites" because of a "synchronized and sophisticated cybercriminal attack from outside Albania."  The politically motivated disruptive operation, per Mandiant, entailed the deployment of a new ransomware family called ROADSWEEP that included a ransom note with the text: "Why should our taxes be spent on the benefit of DURRES terrorists?"   A front named HomeLand Justice has since claimed credit for the cyber offensive, with the group also alle

A nascent service called Dark Utilities  has already attracted 3,000 users for its ability to provide command-and-control (C2) services with the goal of commandeering compromised systems.

Dark Utilities, which emerged in early 2022, is advertised as a "C2-as-a-Service" (C2aaS), offering access to infrastructure hosted on the clearnet as well as the TOR network and associated payloads with support for Windows, Linux, and Python-based implementations for a mere €9.99.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been targeting Russian entities with a newly discovered remote access trojan called Woody RAT  for at least a year as part of a spear-phishing campaign.  The advanced custom backdoor is said to be delivered via either of two methods: archive files or Microsoft Office documents leveraging the now-patched "Follina" support diagnostic tool vulnerability ( CVE-2022-30190 ) in Windows.  Like other implants engineered for espionage-oriented operations, Woody RAT sports a wide range of features that enables the threat actor to remotely commandeer and steal sensitive information from the infected systems.  "The earliest versions of this RAT were typically archived into a ZIP file pretending to be a document specific to a Russian group," Malwarebytes researchers Ankur Saini and Hossein Jazi&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report.   "When the Follina vulnerability became known to the world, the threat actor switched to it to distribute the payload.&amp;quo

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor is said to have "highly likely" exploited a security flaw in an outdated Atlassian Confluence server to deploy a never-before-seen backdoor against an unnamed organization in the research and technical services sector.  The attack, which transpired over a seven-day-period during the end of May, has been attributed to a threat activity cluster tracked by cybersecurity firm Deepwatch as&nbsp; TAC-040 .  "The evidence indicates that the threat actor executed malicious commands with a parent process of tomcat9.exe in Atlassian's Confluence directory," the company&nbsp; said . "After the initial compromise, the threat actor ran various commands to enumerate the local system, network, and Active Directory environment."   The Atlassian vulnerability suspected to have been exploited is&nbsp; CVE-2022-26134 , an Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) injection flaw that paves the way for arbitrary code execution on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance.

A new, large-scale phishing campaign has been observed using adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) techniques to get around security protections and compromise enterprise email accounts.

This is not the first time such a phishing attack has come to light.

Microsoft Uncovers Austrian Company Exploiting Windows and Adobe Zero-Day Exploits<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/microsoft-uncover-austrian-company.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A cyber mercenary that "ostensibly sells general security and information analysis services to commercial customers" used several Windows and Adobe zero-day exploits in limited and highly-targeted attacks against European and Central American entities.  The company, which Microsoft describes as a private-sector offensive actor (PSOA), is an Austria-based outfit called&nbsp; DSIRF &nbsp;that's linked to the development and attempted sale of a piece of cyberweapon referred to as Subzero , which can be used to hack targets' phones, computers, and internet-connected devices.  "Observed victims to date include law firms, banks, and strategic consultancies in countries such as Austria, the United Kingdom, and Panama," the tech giant's cybersecurity teams&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report.  Microsoft is&nbsp; tracking &nbsp;the actor under the moniker KNOTWEED, continuing its trend of naming PSOAs using names given to trees and shrubs.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The mobile threat campaign tracked as&nbsp; Roaming Mantis &nbsp;has been linked to a new wave of compromises directed against French mobile phone users, months after it expanded its targeting to include European countries.  No fewer than 70,000 Android devices are said to have been infected as part of the active malware operation, Sekoia said in a report published last week.  Attack chains involving&nbsp; Roaming Mantis , a financially motivated Chinese threat actor, are known to either deploy a piece of banking trojan named MoqHao (aka XLoader) or redirect iPhone users to credential harvesting landing pages that mimic the iCloud login page.   "MoqHao (aka Wroba, XLoader for Android) is an Android remote access trojan (RAT) with information-stealing and backdoor capabilities that likely spreads via SMS," Sekoia researchers&nbsp; said .

Ukrainian radio operator TAVR Media on Thursday became the latest victim of a cyberattack, resulting in the broadcast of a fake message that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was seriously ill.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A large software development company whose software is used by different state entities in Ukraine was at the receiving end of an "uncommon" piece of malware, new research has found.  The malware, first observed on the morning of May 19, 2022, is a custom variant of the open source backdoor known as&nbsp; GoMet &nbsp;and is designed for maintaining persistent access to the network.  "This access could be leveraged in a variety of ways including deeper access or to launch additional attacks, including the potential for software supply chain compromise," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.   Although there are no concrete indicators linking the attack to a single actor or group, the cybersecurity firm's assessment points to Russian nation-state activity.  Public reporting into the use of GoMet in real-world attacks has so far uncovered only two documented cases to date: one in 2020, coinciding with the disclosure of&nbsp; CVE-2020-5902 , a critical remot

A new method devised to leak information and jump over air-gaps takes advantage of Serial Advanced Technology Attachment ( SATA ) or Serial ATA cables as a communication medium, adding to a&nbsp; long list &nbsp;of electromagnetic, magnetic, electric, optical, and acoustic methods already demonstrated to plunder data.  "Although air-gap computers have no wireless connectivity, we show that attackers can use the SATA cable as a wireless antenna to transfer radio signals at the 6GHz frequency band," Dr. Mordechai Guri, the head of R&amp;D in the Cyber Security Research Center in the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel,&nbsp; wrote &nbsp;in a paper published last week.  The technique, dubbed&nbsp; SATAn , takes advantage of the prevalence of the computer bus interface, making it "highly available to attackers in a wide range of computer systems and IT environments."  Put simply, the goal is to use the SATA cable as a covert channel to emanate electromagnetic signals and transfer a br

VoIP phones using Digium's software have been targeted to drop a web shell on their servers as part of an attack campaign designed to exfiltrate data by downloading and executing additional payloads.  "The malware installs multilayer obfuscated PHP backdoors to the web server's file system, downloads new payloads for execution, and schedules recurring tasks to re-infect the host system," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Friday report.  The unusual activity is said to have commenced in mid-December 2021 and targets Asterisk, a widely used software implementation of a private branch exchange (PBX) that runs on the open-source Elastix Unified Communications Server.   Unit 42 said the intrusions share similarities with the&nbsp; INJ3CTOR3 campaign &nbsp;that Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point disclosed in November 2020, alluding to the possibility that they could be a "resurgence" of the previous attacks.

A group of academics from the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) has warned of a novel technique that could be used to defeat&nbsp; anonymity protections &nbsp;and identify a unique website visitor.

The cache-based targeted&nbsp; de-anonymization attack &nbsp;is a&nbsp; cross-site leak &nbsp;that involves the adversary leveraging a service such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or YouTube to privately share a resource (e.g., image, video, or a YouTube playlist) with the target, followed by embedding the shared resource into the attack website.

North Korean Hackers Targeting Small and Midsize Businesses with H0lyGh0st Ransomware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/north-korean-hackers-targeting-small.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An emerging threat cluster originating from North Korea has been linked to developing and using ransomware in cyberattacks targeting small businesses since September 2021.  The group, which calls itself H0lyGh0st after the ransomware payload of the same name, is being tracked by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center under the moniker DEV-0530, a designation assigned for unknown, emerging, or a developing group of threat activity.  Targeted entities primarily include small-to-midsize businesses such as manufacturing organizations, banks, schools, and event and meeting planning companies.  "Along with their H0lyGh0st payload, DEV-0530 maintains an .onion site that the group uses to interact with their victims," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday analysis.  "The group's standard methodology is to encrypt all files on the target device and use the file extension .h0lyenc, send the victim a sample of the files as proof, and then demand payment in Bitcoin in exchange

State-Backed Hackers Targeting Journalists in Widespread Espionage Campaigns<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/state-backed-hackers-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Nation-state hacking groups aligned with China, Iran, North Korea, and Turkey have been targeting journalists to conduct espionage and spread malware as part of a series of campaigns since early 2021.  "Most commonly, phishing attacks targeting journalists are used for espionage or to gain key insights into the inner workings of another government, company, or other area of state-designated import," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The ultimate goal of the intrusions, the enterprise security firm said, is to gain a competitive intelligence edge or spread disinformation and propaganda.   Proofpoint said it identified two Chinese hacking groups, TA412 (aka&nbsp; Zirconium &nbsp;or Judgment Panda) and&nbsp; TA459 , targeting media personnel with malicious emails containing web beacons and weaponized documents respectively that were used to amass information about the recipients' network environments and drop&nbsp; Chinoxy &nbsp;malware.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as Transparent Tribe  has been attributed to a new ongoing phishing campaign targeting students at various educational institutions in India at least since December 2021.  "This new campaign also suggests that the APT is actively expanding its network of victims to include civilian users," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Also tracked under the monikers APT36, Operation C-Major, PROJECTM, Mythic Leopard, the Transparent Tribe actor is&nbsp; suspected &nbsp;to be of Pakistani origin and is known to strike government entities and think tanks in India and Afghanistan with custom malware such as CrimsonRAT, ObliqueRAT, and CapraRAT.   But the targeting of educational institutions and students, first&nbsp; observed &nbsp;by India-based K7 Labs in May 2022, indicates a deviation from the adversary's typical focus.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's being described as an "unprecedented" twist, the operators of the TrickBot malware have resorted to systematically targeting Ukraine since the onset of the war in late February 2022.  The group is believed to have orchestrated at least six phishing campaigns aimed at targets that align with Russian state interests, with the emails acting as lures for delivering malicious software such as IcedID, CobaltStrike, AnchorMail, and&nbsp; Meterpreter .  Tracked under the names ITG23,&nbsp; Gold Blackburn , and Wizard Spider, the&nbsp; financially motivated cybercrime gang &nbsp;is known for its development of the TrickBot banking trojan and was&nbsp; subsumed &nbsp;into the now-discontinued&nbsp; Conti ransomware cartel &nbsp;earlier this year.  But merely weeks later, the actors associated with the group resurfaced with a revamped version of the&nbsp; AnchorDNS &nbsp;backdoor called&nbsp; AnchorMail &nbsp;that uses SMTPS and IMAP protocols for command-and-control communications.

In a new joint cybersecurity advisory, U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have warned about the use of Maui ransomware by North Korean government-backed hackers to target the healthcare sector since at least May 2021.  "North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors used Maui ransomware in these incidents to encrypt servers responsible for healthcare services—including electronic health records services, diagnostics services, imaging services, and intranet services," the authorities&nbsp; noted .  The&nbsp; alert &nbsp;comes courtesy of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of the Treasury.  Cybersecurity firm Stairwell, whose findings formed the basis of the advisory, said the lesser-known ransomware family stands out because of a lack of several key features commonly associated with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups.   This includes the absence of "embedded ransom note to provide recov

Authored by an Indian security researcher named&nbsp; Chetan Nayak , Brute Ratel (BRc4) is analogous to Cobalt Strike and is&nbsp; described &nbsp;as a "customized command-and-control center for red team and adversary simulation."   The commercial software was first released in late 2020 and has since gained over 480 licenses across 350 customers. Each license is offered at $2,500 per user for a year, after which it can be renewed for the same duration at the cost of $2,250.  BRc4 is equipped with a wide variety of features,

A pro-China&nbsp; influence campaign &nbsp;singled out rare earth mining companies in Australia, Canada, and the U.S. with negative messaging in an unsuccessful attempt to manipulate public discourse to China's benefit.

A cloud threat actor group tracked as 8220 has updated its malware toolset to breach Linux servers with the goal of installing crypto miners as part of a long-running campaign.  "The updates include the deployment of new versions of a crypto miner and an IRC bot," Microsoft Security Intelligence said  in a series of tweets on Thursday. "The group has actively updated its techniques and payloads over the last year."  8220, active since early 2017 , is a Chinese-speaking, Monero-mining threat actor so named for its preference to communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers over port 8220. It's also the developer of a tool called whatMiner, which has been co-opted by the Rocke  cybercrime group in their attacks.   In July 2019, the Alibaba Cloud Security Team uncovered  an extra shift in the adversary's tactics, noting its use of rootkits to hide the mining program. Two years later, the gang resurfaced  with Tsunami IRC botnet  variants and a custom "

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected ransomware intrusion against an unnamed target leveraged a Mitel VoIP appliance as an entry point to achieve remote code execution and gain initial access to the environment.  The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;come from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which traced the source of the attack to a Linux-based Mitel VoIP device sitting on the network perimeter, while also identifying a previously unknown exploit as well as a couple of anti-forensic measures adopted by the actor on the device to erase traces of their actions.  The exploit in question is tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-29499 &nbsp;and was fixed by Mitel in April 2022. It's rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system, making it a critical shortcoming.   "A vulnerability has been identified in the Mitel Service Appliance component of MiVoice Connect (Mitel Service Appliances – SA 100, SA 400, and Virtual SA) which could allow a malicious actor to perform remote code execution (CVE-2022-29499) within the context

The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has&nbsp; cautioned &nbsp;of a new set of spear-phishing attacks exploiting the "Follina" flaw in the Windows operating system to deploy password-stealing malware.  Attributing the intrusions to a Russian nation-state group tracked as APT28 (aka Fancy Bear or Sofacy), the agency said the attacks commence with a lure document titled "Nuclear Terrorism A Very Real Threat.rtf" that, when opened, exploits the recently disclosed vulnerability to download and execute a malware called CredoMap.  Follina ( CVE-2022-30190 , CVSS score: 7.8), which concerns a case of remote code execution affecting the Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), was addressed by Microsoft on June 14, 2022, as part of its&nbsp; Patch Tuesday updates .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new kind of Windows NTLM relay attack dubbed&nbsp; DFSCoerce &nbsp;has been uncovered that leverages the Distributed File System (DFS): Namespace Management Protocol (MS-DFSNM) to seize control of a domain.

MS-DFSNM &nbsp;provides a remote procedure call (RPC) interface for administering distributed file system configurations.  The NTLM (NT Lan Manager) relay attack is a well-known method that exploits the challenge-response mechanism.

Chinese Hackers Exploited Sophos Firewall Zero-Day Flaw to Target South Asian Entity<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/chinese-hackers-exploited-sophos.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A sophisticated Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) actor exploited a critical security vulnerability in Sophos' firewall product that came to light earlier this year to infiltrate an unnamed South Asian target as part of a highly-targeted attack.  "The attacker implement[ed] an interesting web shell backdoor, create[d] a secondary form of persistence, and ultimately launch[ed] attacks against the customer's staff," Volexity&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "These attacks aimed to further breach cloud-hosted web servers hosting the organization's public-facing websites."  The zero-day flaw in question is tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-1040 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), and concerns an authentication bypass vulnerability that can be weaponized to execute arbitrary code remotely. It affects Sophos Firewall versions 18.5 MR3 (18.5.3) and earlier.   The cybersecurity firm, which issued a patch for the flaw on March 25, 2022, noted that it was abused to "target a small set of spec

A Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Gallium has been observed using a previously undocumented remote access trojan in its espionage attacks targeting companies operating in Southeast Asia, Europe, and Africa.  Called&nbsp; PingPull , the "difficult-to-detect" backdoor is notable for its use of the Internet Control Message Protocol ( ICMP ) for command-and-control (C2) communications, according to new research published by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 today.   Gallium is known for its attacks primarily aimed at telecom companies dating as far back as 2012. Also tracked under the name&nbsp; Soft Cell &nbsp;by Cybereason, the state-sponsored actor has been&nbsp; connected &nbsp;to a broader set of attacks targeting five major telecom companies located in Southeast Asian countries since 2017.

The Iranian state-sponsored threat actor tracked under the moniker Lyceum has turned to using a new custom .NET-based backdoor in recent campaigns directed against the Middle East.  "The new malware is a .NET based DNS Backdoor which is a customized version of the open source tool 'DIG.net,'" Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Niraj Shivtarkar and Avinash Kumar&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.  "The malware leverages a DNS attack technique called 'DNS Hijacking' in which an attacker-controlled DNS server manipulates the response of DNS queries and resolves them as per their malicious requirements."   DNS hijacking is a&nbsp; redirection attack &nbsp;in which DNS queries to genuine websites are intercepted to take an unsuspecting user to fraudulent pages under an adversary's control. Unlike&nbsp; cache poisoning , DNS hijacking targets the DNS record of the website on the nameserver, rather than a resolver's cache.   Lyceum , also known as Hexane, Spirli

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Chinese-speaking advanced persistent threat (APT) actor dubbed&nbsp; Aoqin Dragon &nbsp;has been linked to a string of espionage-oriented attacks aimed at government, education, and telecom entities chiefly in Southeast Asia and Australia dating as far back as 2013.  "Aoqin Dragon seeks initial access primarily through document exploits and the use of fake removable devices," SentinelOne researcher Joey Chen&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Other techniques the attacker has been observed using include DLL hijacking,&nbsp; Themida-packed files , and DNS tunneling to evade post-compromise detection."  The group is said to have some level of association with another threat actor known as&nbsp; Naikon &nbsp;(aka Override Panda), with campaigns primarily directed against targets in Australia, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam.

Researchers Warn of Spam Campaign Targeting Victims with SVCReady Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/researchers-warn-of-spam-campaign.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new wave of phishing campaigns has been observed spreading a previously documented malware called SVCReady .  "The malware is notable for the unusual way it is delivered to target PCs — using shellcode hidden in the properties of Microsoft Office documents," Patrick Schläpfer, a threat analyst at HP,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up.  SVCReady is said to be in its early stage of development, with the authors iteratively updating the malware several times last month. First signs of activity date back to April 22, 2022.  Infection chains involve sending Microsoft Word document attachments to targets via email that contain VBA macros to activate the deployment of malicious payloads.   But where this campaign stands apart is that instead of employing PowerShell or MSHTA to retrieve next-stage executables from a remote server, the macro runs shellcode stored in the&nbsp; document properties , which subsequently drops the SVCReady malware.  In addition to achieving persistence on the i

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) last week disclosed that it had taken legal proceedings against an Iranian threat actor dubbed&nbsp; Bohrium &nbsp;in connection with a spear-phishing operation.  The adversarial collective is said to have targeted entities in tech, transportation, government, and education sectors located in the U.S., Middle East, and India.   "Bohrium actors create fake social media profiles, often posing as recruiters," Amy Hogan-Burney of the DCU&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a tweet. "Once personal information was obtained from the victims, Bohrium sent malicious emails with links that ultimately infected their target's computers with malware."  According to an&nbsp; ex parte order &nbsp;shared by the tech giant, the goal of the intrusions was to steal and exfiltrate sensitive information, take control over the infected machines, and carry out remote reconnaissance.  To halt the malicious activities of Bohrium, Microsoft said it took down 41 ".com," ".info

A suspected state-aligned threat actor has been attributed to a new set of attacks exploiting the Microsoft Office "Follina" vulnerability to target government entities in Europe and the U.S.  Enterprise security firm Proofpoint said it blocked attempts at exploiting the remote code execution flaw, which is being tracked&nbsp; CVE-2022-30190 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8).

"This campaign masqueraded as a salary increase and utilized an RTF with the exploit payload downloaded from 45.76.53[.]253," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets.   The payload, which manifests in the form of a PowerShell script, is Base64-encoded and functions as a downloader to retrieve a second PowerShell script from a remote server named "seller-notification[.]live."

Atlassian on Friday rolled out fixes to address a&nbsp; critical security flaw &nbsp;affecting its Confluence Server and Data Center products that have come under active exploitation by threat actors to achieve remote code execution.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-26134 , the issue is similar to&nbsp; CVE-2021-26084 &nbsp;— another security flaw the Australian software company patched in August 2021.  Both relate to a case of Object-Graph Navigation Language ( OGNL ) injection that could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance.   The newly discovered shortcoming impacts all supported versions of Confluence Server and Data Center, with every version after 1.3.0 also affected. It's been resolved in the following versions -   7.4.17  7.13.7  7.14.3  7.15.2  7.16.4  7.17.4  7.18.1   According to stats from internet asset discovery platform&nbsp; Censys , there are about 9,325 services across 8,347 distinct hosts running a vulnerable version of Atlassian Confluenc

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An "extremely sophisticated" Chinese-speaking advanced persistent threat (APT) actor dubbed&nbsp; LuoYu &nbsp;has been observed using a malicious Windows tool called WinDealer that's delivered by means of man-on-the-side attacks.  "This groundbreaking development allows the actor to modify network traffic in-transit to insert malicious payloads," Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "Such attacks are especially dangerous and devastating because they do not require any interaction with the target to lead to a successful infection."  Known to be active since 2008, organizations targeted by LuoYu are predominantly foreign diplomatic organizations established in China and members of the academic community as well as financial, defense, logistics, and telecommunications companies.   LuoYu's use of&nbsp; WinDealer &nbsp;was first documented by Taiwanese cybersecurity firm&nbsp; TeamT5 &nbsp;at the Japan Security Analyst Conference (JSAC) in January 2021. S

Microsoft on Thursday said it took steps to disable malicious activity stemming from abuse of OneDrive by a previously undocumented threat actor it tracks under the chemical element-themed moniker Polonium.

"The observed activity was coordinated with other actors affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), based primarily on victim overlap and commonality of tools and techniques," MSTIC&nbsp; assessed &nbsp;with "moderate confidence."   The adversarial collective is believed to have breached more than 20 organizations based in Israel and one intergovernmental organization with operations in Lebanon since February 2022.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new ransomware strain called&nbsp; GoodWill &nbsp;that compels victims into donating for social causes and provide financial assistance to people in need.  "The ransomware group propagates very unusual demands in exchange for the decryption key," researchers from CloudSEK&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "The Robin Hood-like group claims to be interested in helping the less fortunate, rather than extorting victims for financial motivations."   Written in .NET, the ransomware was first identified by the India-based cybersecurity firm in March 2022, with the infections rendering sensitive files inaccessible without decrypting them. The malware, which makes use of the&nbsp; AES algorithm &nbsp;for encryption, is also notable for sleeping for 722.45 seconds to interfere with dynamic analysis.  The encryption process is followed by displaying a multiple-paged ransom note that requires the victims to carry out three socially-driven activitie

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown advanced persistent threat (APT) group has been linked to a series of spear-phishing attacks targeting Russian government entities since the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war in late February 2022.  "The campaigns [...] are designed to implant a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that can be used to surveil the computers it infects, and run commands on them remotely," Malwarebytes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published Tuesday.  The cybersecurity company attributed the attacks with low confidence to a Chinese hacking group, citing infrastructure overlaps between the RAT and Sakula Rat malware used by a threat actor known as&nbsp; Deep Panda .  The attack chains, while leveraging different lures over the course of two months, all employed the same malware barring small differences in the source code.   The campaign is said to have commenced around February 26, days after Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, with the emails distributing the RAT under the guise of an interac

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A case of software supply chain attack has been observed in the Rust programming language's&nbsp; crate registry &nbsp;that leveraged typosquatting techniques to publish a rogue library containing malware.  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne dubbed the attack " CrateDepression ."  Typosquatting attacks&nbsp; take place &nbsp;when an adversary mimics the name of a popular package on a public registry in hopes that developers will accidentally download the malicious package instead of the legitimate library.   In this case, the crate in question is "rustdecimal," a typosquat of the real " rust_decimal " package that's been downloaded over 3.5 million times to date. The package was&nbsp; flagged &nbsp;earlier this month on May 3 by Askar Safin, a Moscow-based developer.  According to an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;published by the Rust maintainers, the crate is said to have been first pushed on March 25, 2022, attracting fewer than 500 downloads before it was permanently removed from the repository.

Hackers Exploiting VMware Horizon to Target South Korea with NukeSped Backdoor<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/hackers-exploiting-vmware-horizon-to.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korea-backed Lazarus Group has been observed leveraging the&nbsp; Log4Shell vulnerability &nbsp;in VMware Horizon servers to deploy the NukeSped  (aka Manuscrypt) implant against targets located in its southern counterpart.  "The attacker used the Log4j vulnerability on VMware Horizon products that were not applied with the security patch," AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.   The intrusions are said to have been first discovered in April, although&nbsp; multiple threat actors , including those aligned with&nbsp; China &nbsp;and&nbsp; Iran , have employed the same approach to further their objectives over the past few months.   NukeSped is a backdoor that can perform various malicious activities based on commands received from a remote attacker-controlled domain. Last year, Kaspersky disclosed a spear-phishing campaign aimed at stealing critical data from defense companies using a NukeSped variant called&nbsp; ThreatNeedle .

Fraudulent domains masquerading as Microsoft's Windows 11 download portal are attempting to trick users into deploying trojanized installation files to infect systems with the Vidar information stealer malware.

"These variants of Vidar malware fetch the C2 configuration from attacker-controlled social media channels hosted on Telegram and Mastodon network."  Some of the rogue distribution vector domains, which were registered last month on April 20, consist of ms-win11[.]com, win11-serv[.]com, and win11install[.]com, and ms-teams-app[.]net.   In addition, the cybersecurity firm cautioned that the threat actor behind the impersonation campaign is also leveraging backdoored versions of Adobe Photoshop and other legitimate software such as Microsoft Teams to deliver Vidar malware.

Microsoft on Tuesday warned that it recently spotted a malicious campaign targeting SQL Servers that leverages a built-in PowerShell binary to achieve persistence on compromised systems.

The sqlps.exe utility, which comes by default with all versions of SQL Servers, enables an SQL Agent — a Windows service to run scheduled tasks — to run jobs using the PowerShell subsystem.  "The attackers achieve fileless persistence by spawning the sqlps.exe utility, a PowerShell wrapper for running SQL-built cmdlets, to run recon commands and change the start mode of the SQL service to LocalSystem," Microsoft noted.

Russian Conti Ransomware Gang Threatens to Overthrow New Costa Rican Government<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/russian-conti-ransomware-gang-threatens.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious Conti ransomware gang, which last month staged an attack on Costa Rican administrative systems, has threatened to "overthrow" the new government of the country.  "We are determined to overthrow the government by means of a cyber attack, we have already shown you all the strength and power," the group said on its official website. "We have our insiders in your government. We are also working on gaining access to your other systems, you have no other options but to pay us."  In a further attempt to increase pressure, the Russian-speaking cybercrime syndicate has raised its ransom demand to $20 million in return for a decryption key to unlock their systems.  Another message posted on its dark web portal over the weekend issued a warning stating it will delete the decryption keys in a week, a move that would make it impossible for Costa Rica to recover access to the files encrypted by the ransomware.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A spear-phishing campaign targeting Jordan's foreign ministry has been observed dropping a new stealthy backdoor dubbed Saitama.  Researchers from Malwarebytes and Fortinet FortiGuard Labs&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the campaign to an Iranian cyber espionage threat actor tracked under the moniker APT34, citing&nbsp; resemblances &nbsp;to past campaigns staged by the group.  "Like many of these attacks, the email contained a malicious attachment," Fortinet researcher Fred Gutierrez&nbsp; said . "However, the attached threat was not a garden-variety malware. Instead, it had the capabilities and techniques usually associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs)."   APT34, also known as OilRig, Helix Kitten, and Cobalt Gypsy, is known to be active since at least 2014 and has a track record of striking telecom, government, defense, oil, and financial sectors in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) via targeted phishing attacks.  Earlier this February, ESET&nbsp; tied &nbsp;the group to a long-runni

A ransomware group with an Iranian operational connection has been linked to a string of file-encrypting malware attacks targeting organizations in Israel, the U.S., Europe, and Australia.  Cybersecurity firm Secureworks attributed the intrusions to a threat actor it tracks under the moniker Cobalt Mirage, which it said is linked to an Iranian hacking crew dubbed Cobalt Illusion (aka APT35, Charming Kitten, Newscaster, or Phosphorus).  "Elements of Cobalt Mirage activity have been&nbsp; reported &nbsp;as&nbsp; Phosphorus &nbsp;and&nbsp; TunnelVision ," Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.   The threat actor is said to have conducted two different sets of intrusions, one of which relates to opportunistic ransomware attacks involving the use of legitimate tools like&nbsp; BitLocker &nbsp;and DiskCryptor for financial gain.

The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has warned of phishing attacks that deploy an information-stealing malware called Jester Stealer  on compromised systems.  The mass email campaign carries the subject line "chemical attack" and contains a link to a macro-enabled Microsoft Excel file, opening which leads to computers getting infected with Jester Stealer.  The attack, which requires potential victims to enable macros after opening the document, works by downloading and executing an .EXE file that is retrieved from compromised web resources, CERT-UA detailed.   Jester Stealer, which was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Cyble in February 2022, comes with features to steal and transmit login credentials, cookies, and credit card information along with data from passwords managers, chat messengers, email clients, crypto wallets, and gaming apps to the attackers.

GitHub Says Recent Attack Involving Stolen OAuth Tokens Was "Highly Targeted"<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/github-says-recent-attack-involving.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud-based code hosting platform GitHub described the recent&nbsp; attack campaign &nbsp;involving the abuse of OAuth access tokens issued to Heroku and Travis-CI as "highly targeted" in nature.  "This pattern of behavior suggests the attacker was only listing organizations in order to identify accounts to selectively target for listing and downloading private repositories," GitHub's Mike Hanley&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an updated post.   The&nbsp; security incident , which it discovered on April 12, related to an unidentified attacker leveraging stolen OAuth user tokens issued to two third-party OAuth integrators, Heroku and Travis-CI, to download data from dozens of organizations, including NPM.  The Microsoft-owned company said last week that it's in the process of sending a final set of notifications to GitHub customers who had either the Heroku or Travis CI OAuth app integrations authorized in their accounts.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Russian state-sponsored threat actor has been observed targeting diplomatic and government entities as part of a series of phishing campaigns commencing on January 17, 2022.  Threat intelligence and incident response firm Mandiant attributed the attacks to a hacking group tracked as APT29 (aka Cozy Bear), with some set of the activities associated with the crew assigned the moniker&nbsp; Nobelium &nbsp;(aka UNC2452/2652).  "This latest wave of spear phishing showcases APT29's enduring interests in obtaining diplomatic and foreign policy information from governments around the world," Mandiant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.  The initial access is said to have been aided through spear-phishing emails masquerading as administrative notices, using legitimate but compromised email addresses from other diplomatic entities.   These emails contain an HTML dropper attachment called ROOTSAW (aka&nbsp; EnvyScout ) that, when opened, triggers an infection sequence that delivers and exec

At least six different Russia-aligned actors launched no less than 237 cyberattacks against Ukraine from February 23 to April 8, including 38 discrete destructive attacks that irrevocably destroyed files in hundreds of systems across dozens of organizations in the country.

Cloudflare Thwarts Record DDoS Attack Peaking at 15 Million Requests Per Second<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/cloudflare-thwarts-record-ddos-attack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloudflare on Wednesday disclosed that it acted to mitigate a 15.3 million request-per-second (RPS) distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. The web infrastructure and website security company called it one of the "largest HTTPS DDoS attacks on record."&nbsp;  "HTTPS DDoS attacks are more expensive in terms of required computational resources because of the higher cost of establishing a secure TLS encrypted connection," Cloudflare's Omer Yoachimik and Julien Desgats&nbsp; said . "Therefore it costs the attacker more to launch the attack, and for the victim to mitigate it."   The volumetric DDoS attack is said to have lasted less than 15 seconds and targeted an unnamed Cloudflare customer operating a crypto launchpad.&nbsp;  Volumetric DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm a target network/service with significantly high volumes of malicious traffic, which typically originate from a botnet under a threat actor's control.

A China-linked government-sponsored threat actor observed striking European diplomatic entities in March may have been targeting Russian government officials with an updated version of a remote access trojan called&nbsp; PlugX .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A state-backed threat actor with ties to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DRPK) has been attributed to a spear-phishing campaign targeting journalists covering the country with the ultimate goal of deploying a backdoor on infected Windows systems.  The intrusions, said to be the work of Ricochet Chollima, resulted in the deployment of a novel malware strain called GOLDBACKDOOR, an artifact that shares technical overlaps with another malware named BLUELIGHT, which has been previously linked to the group.  "Journalists are high-value targets for hostile governments," cybersecurity firm Stairwell&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "Compromising a journalist can provide access to highly-sensitive information and enable additional attacks against their sources."

An Iranian-linked threat actor known as&nbsp; Rocket Kitten &nbsp;has been observed actively exploiting a recently patched VMware vulnerability to gain initial access and deploy the Core Impact penetration testing tool on vulnerable systems.

While the issue was patched by the virtualization services provider on April 6, 2022, the company&nbsp; cautioned users &nbsp;of confirmed exploitation of the flaw occurring in the wild a week later.  "A malicious actor exploiting this RCE vulnerability potentially gains an unlimited attack surface," researchers from Morphisec Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.

A previously unknown zero-click exploit in Apple's iMessage was used to install mercenary spyware from&nbsp; NSO Group &nbsp;and&nbsp; Candiru &nbsp;against at least 65 individuals as part of a "multi-year clandestine operation."  "Victims included Members of the European Parliament, Catalan Presidents, legislators, jurists, and members of civil society organizations," the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "Family members were also infected in some cases."  Of the 65 individuals, 63 were targeted with Pegasus and four others were infected with Candiru, with iPhones belonging to at least two compromised with both. The incidents are said to have mostly occurred between 2017 and 2020.   The attacks involved the weaponization of an iOS exploit dubbed HOMAGE that made it possible to penetrate the devices running versions prior to iOS 13.2, which was released on October 28, 2019. It's worth noting that the latest version of iOS is iOS 15.4.1.

New Hacking Campaign Targeting Ukrainian Government with IcedID Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/new-hacking-campaign-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has warned of a new wave of social engineering campaigns delivering IcedID malware and leveraging Zimbra exploits with the goal of stealing sensitive information.  Attributing the IcedID phishing attacks to a threat cluster named UAC-0041, the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;the infection sequence begins with an email containing a Microsoft Excel document (Мобілізаційний реєстр.xls or Mobilization Register.xls) that, when opened, prompts the users to enable macros, leading to the deployment of IcedID.   The&nbsp; information-stealing malware , also known as BokBot, has followed a similar trajectory to that of TrickBot, Emotet, and ZLoader, evolving from its earlier roots as a banking trojan to a full-fledged crimeware service that facilities the retrieval of next-stage implants such as ransomware.   The&nbsp; second set of targeted intrusions &nbsp;relate to a new threat group dubbed UAC-0097, with the email including a number of image attachments with a&nbsp; Cont

A Chinese state-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) group known for singling out Japanese entities has been attributed to a new long-running espionage campaign targeting new geographies, suggesting a "widening" of the threat actor's targeting.  The widespread intrusions, which are believed to have commenced at the earliest in mid-2021 and continued as recently as February 2022, have been tied to a group tracked as Cicada , which is also known as APT10, Stone Panda, Potassium, Bronze Riverside, or MenuPass Team.

Russian Wiper Malware Likely Behind Recent Cyberattack on Viasat KA-SAT Modems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/russian-wiper-malware-responsible-for.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The cyberattack aimed at Viasat that temporarily knocked KA-SAT modems offline on February 24, 2022, the same day Russian military forces invaded Ukraine, is believed to have been the consequence of wiper malware, according to the&nbsp; latest research &nbsp;from SentinelOne.  The findings come as the U.S. telecom company&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;that it was the target of a multifaceted and deliberate" cyberattack against its KA-SAT network, linking it to a "ground-based network intrusion by an attacker exploiting a misconfiguration in a VPN appliance to gain remote access to the trusted management segment of the KA-SAT network."  Upon gaining access, the adversary issued "destructive commands" on tens of thousands of modems belonging to the satellite broadband service that "overwrote key data in flash memory on the modems, rendering the modems unable to access the network, but not permanently unusable."   But SentinelOne said it uncovered a new piece of malware (named &amp;qu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese advanced persistent threat tracked as Deep Panda has been observed exploiting the&nbsp; Log4Shell vulnerability &nbsp;in VMware Horizon servers to deploy a backdoor and a novel rootkit on infected machines with the goal of stealing sensitive data.  "The nature of targeting was opportunistic insofar that multiple infections in several countries and various sectors occurred on the same dates,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Rotem Sde-Or and Eliran Voronovitch, researchers with Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs, in a report released this week. "The victims belong to the financial, academic, cosmetics, and travel industries."  Deep Panda , also known by the monikers Shell Crew, KungFu Kittens, and Bronze Firestone, is said to have been active since at least 2010, with recent attacks "targeting legal firms for data exfiltration and technology providers for command-and-control infrastructure building,"&nbsp; according &nbsp;to Secureworks.

A Belarusian threat actor known as Ghostwriter (aka UNC1151) has been spotted leveraging the recently disclosed browser-in-the-browser (BitB) technique as part of their credential phishing campaigns exploiting the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict.  The method, which&nbsp; masquerades &nbsp;as a legitimate domain by simulating a browser window within the browser, makes it possible to mount convincing social engineering campaigns.  "Ghostwriter actors have quickly adopted this new technique, combining it with a previously observed technique, hosting credential phishing landing pages on compromised sites," Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report, using it to siphon credentials entered by unsuspected victims to a remote server.  Among other groups&nbsp; using the war as a lure &nbsp;in phishing and malware campaigns to deceive targets into opening fraudulent emails or links include&nbsp; Mustang Panda &nbsp;and&nbsp; Scarab &nbsp;as well as nation-state actors from Iran, North Korea, and Russia

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A nascent information stealer called Mars has been observed in campaigns that take advantage of cracked versions of the malware to steal information stored in web browsers and cryptocurrency wallets.  "Mars Stealer is being distributed via social engineering techniques, malspam campaigns, malicious software cracks, and keygens," Morphisec malware researcher Arnold Osipov&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday.  Based on the&nbsp; Oski Stealer &nbsp;and first discovered in June 2021,&nbsp; Mars Stealer &nbsp;is said to be constantly under development and available for sale on over 47 underground forums, darknet sites, and Telegram channels, costing only $160 for a lifetime subscription.   Information stealers allow adversaries to vacuum personal information from compromised systems, including stored credentials and browser cookies, which are then sold on criminal marketplaces or used as a springboard for launching further attacks.

A threat actor of likely Pakistani origin has been attributed to yet another campaign designed to backdoor targets of interest with a Windows-based remote access trojan named CrimsonRAT since at least June 2021.  "Transparent Tribe has been a highly active APT group in the Indian subcontinent," Cisco Talos researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis shared with The Hacker News.

This campaign furthers this targeting and their central goal of establishing long term access for espionage."   Last month, the advanced persistent threat expanded its malware toolset to compromise Android devices with a backdoor named&nbsp; CapraRAT &nbsp;that exhibits a high "degree of crossover" with CrimsonRAT.

A threat actor dubbed " RED-LILI " has been linked to an ongoing large-scale supply chain attack campaign targeting the NPM package repository by publishing nearly 800 malicious modules.  "Customarily, attackers use an anonymous disposable NPM account from which they launch their attacks," Israeli security company Checkmarx&nbsp; said . "As it seems this time, the attacker has fully-automated the process of NPM account creation and has opened dedicated accounts, one per package, making his new malicious packages batch harder to spot."  The findings build on recent reports from&nbsp; JFrog &nbsp;and&nbsp; Sonatype , both of which detailed hundreds of NPM packages that leverage techniques like&nbsp; dependency confusion &nbsp;and typosquatting to target Azure, Uber, and Airbnb developers.   According to a detailed analysis of RED-LILI's modus operandi, earliest evidence of anomalous activity is said to have occurred on February 23, 2022, with the cluster of malicious packages publis

An independent security researcher has shared what's a detailed timeline of events that transpired as the notorious LAPSUS$ extortion gang broke into a third-party provider linked to the cyber incident at Okta in late January 2022.  In a set of screenshots posted on Twitter, Bill Demirkapi&nbsp; published &nbsp;a two-page "intrusion timeline" allegedly prepared by Mandiant, the cybersecurity firm hired by Sitel to investigate the security breach. Sitel, through its acquisition of Sykes Enterprises in September 2021, is the third-party service provider that provides customer support on behalf of Okta.  The authentication services provider revealed last week that on January 20, it was alerted to a new factor that was added to a Sitel customer support engineer's Okta account, an attempt that it said was successful and blocked.   The incident only came to light two months later after LAPSUS$&nbsp; posted screenshots &nbsp;on their Telegram channel as evidence of the breach on March 22.  The

'Purple Fox' Hackers Spotted Using New Variant of FatalRAT in Recent Malware Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/purple-fox-hackers-spotted-using-new.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators of the&nbsp; Purple Fox malware &nbsp;have retooled their malware arsenal with a new variant of a remote access trojan called FatalRAT, while also simultaneously upgrading their evasion mechanisms to bypass security software.  "Users' machines are targeted via trojanized software packages masquerading as legitimate application installers," Trend Micro researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published on March 25, 2022. "The installers are actively distributed online to trick users and increase the overall botnet infrastructure."   The findings follow&nbsp; prior research &nbsp;from Minerva Labs that shed light on a similar modus operandi of leveraging fraudulent Telegram applications to distribute the backdoor. Other disguised software installers include WhatsApp, Adobe Flash Player, and Google Chrome.  These packages act as a first-stage loader, triggering an infection sequence that leads to the deployment of a second-stage payload from a remote server and culminating in the

Authentication services provider Okta on Wednesday named Sitel as the third-party linked to a&nbsp; security incident &nbsp;experienced by the company in late January that allowed the LAPSUS$ extortion gang to remotely take over an internal account belonging to a customer support engineer.  The company added that 366 corporate customers, or about 2.5% of its customer base, may have been impacted by the "highly constrained" compromise.  "On January 20, 2022, the Okta Security team was alerted that a new factor was added to a Sitel customer support engineer' Okta account [from a new location]," Okta's Chief Security Officer, David Bradbury,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. "This factor was a password."  The disclosure comes after LAPSUS$ posted screenshots of Okta's apps and systems earlier this week, about two months after the hackers gain access to the company's internal network over a five-day period between January 16 and 21, 2022 using remote desktop proto

Iranian Hackers Targeting Turkey and Arabian Peninsula in New Malware Campaign<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/iranian-hackers-targeting-turkey-and.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian state-sponsored threat actor known as MuddyWater has been attributed to a new swarm of attacks targeting Turkey and the Arabian Peninsula with the goal of deploying remote access trojans (RATs) on compromised systems.  "The MuddyWater supergroup is highly motivated and can use unauthorized access to conduct espionage, intellectual property theft, and deploy ransomware and destructive malware in an enterprise," Cisco Talos researchers Asheer Malhotra, Vitor Ventura, and Arnaud Zobec&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today.  The group, which has been active since at least 2017, is known for its attacks on various sectors that help further advance Iran's geopolitical and national security objectives. In January 2022, the U.S. Cyber Command attributed the actor to the country's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).   MuddyWater is also believed to be a "conglomerate of&nbsp; multiple teams &nbsp;operating independently rather than a single threat actor group,&amp;q

Details of a new nation-state sponsored phishing campaign have been uncovered setting its sights on European governmental entities in what's seen as an attempt to obtain intelligence on refugee and supply movement in the region.  Enterprise security company Proofpoint, which detected the malicious emails for the first time on February 24, 2022, dubbed the social engineering attacks " Asylum Ambuscade ."  "The email included a malicious macro attachment which utilized social engineering themes pertaining to the Emergency Meeting of the NATO Security Council held on February 23, 2022," researchers Michael Raggi and Zydeca Cass&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday.  "The email also contained a malicious attachment which attempted to download malicious Lua malware named SunSeed and targeted European government personnel tasked with managing transportation and population movement in Europe."

Second New 'IsaacWiper' Data Wiper Targets Ukraine After Russian Invasion<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/second-new-isaacwiper-data-wiper.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new data wiper malware has been observed deployed against an unnamed Ukrainian government network, a day after destructive cyber attacks struck multiple entities in the country preceding the start of Russia's military invasion.  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET dubbed the new malware " IsaacWiper ," which it said was detected on February 24 in an organization that was not affected by&nbsp; HermeticWiper &nbsp;(aka FoxBlade), another data wiping malware that targeted several organizations on February 23 as part of a sabotage operation aimed at rendering the machines inoperable.  Further analysis of the HermeticWiper attacks, which infected at least five Ukrainian organizations, have revealed a worm constituent that propagates the malware across the compromised network and a ransomware module that acts as a "distraction from the wiper attacks," corroborating a&nbsp; prior report &nbsp;from Symantec.   "These destructive attacks leveraged at least three components: HermeticWiper

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Update:  It's worth noting that the malware Microsoft tracks as FoxBlade is the same  as the data wiper that's been denominated HermeticWiper  (aka KillDisk).  Microsoft on Monday disclosed that it detected a new round of offensive and destructive cyberattacks directed against Ukraine's digital infrastructure hours before Russia launched its first missile strikes last week.  The intrusions involved the use of a never-before-seen malware package dubbed FoxBlade , according to the tech giant's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), noting that it added new signatures to its Defender anti-malware service to detect the exploit within three hours of the discovery.   "These recent and ongoing cyberattacks have been precisely targeted, and we have not seen the use of the indiscriminate malware technology that spread across Ukraine's economy and beyond its borders in the&nbsp; 2017 NotPetya attack ," Microsoft's President and Vice Chair, Brad Smith,&nbsp; said .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented espionage tool has been deployed against selected governments and other critical infrastructure targets as part of a long-running espionage campaign orchestrated by China-linked threat actors since at least 2013.  Broadcom's Symantec Threat Hunter team characterized the backdoor, named&nbsp; Daxin , as a technologically advanced malware, allowing the attackers to carry out a variety of communications and information-gathering operations aimed at entities in the telecom, transportation, and manufacturing sectors that are of strategic interest to China.  "Daxin malware is a highly sophisticated rootkit backdoor with complex, stealthy command-and-control (C2) functionality that enables remote actors to communicate with secured devices not connected directly to the internet," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an independent advisory.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An advanced persistent threat (APT) group operating with objectives aligned with the Chinese government has been linked to an organized supply chain attack on Taiwan's financial sector.  The attacks are said to have first commenced at the end of November 2021, with the intrusions attributed to a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; APT10 , also known as Stone Panda, the MenuPass group, and Bronze Riverside, and known to be active since at least 2009.   The second wave of attacks hit a peak between February 10 and 13, 2022, according to a&nbsp; new report &nbsp;published by Taiwanese cybersecurity firm CyCraft, which said the wide-ranging supply chain compromise specifically targeted the software systems of financial institutions, resulting in "abnormal cases of placing orders."  The infiltration activity, codenamed " Operation Cache Panda ," exploited a vulnerability in the web management interface of the unnamed securities software that has a market share of over 80% in Taiwan, usi

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Vulnerable internet-facing Microsoft SQL (MS SQL) Servers are being targeted by threat actors as part of a new campaign to deploy the Cobalt Strike adversary simulation tool on compromised hosts.  "Attacks that target MS SQL servers include attacks to the environment where its vulnerability has not been patched, brute forcing, and&nbsp; dictionary attack &nbsp;against poorly managed servers," South Korean cybersecurity company AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Monday.   Cobalt Strike is a commercial, full-featured&nbsp; penetration testing framework &nbsp;that allows an attacker to deploy an agent named "Beacon" on the victim machine, granting the operator remote access to the system. Although billed as a red team threat simulation platform,&nbsp; cracked versions &nbsp;of the software have been&nbsp; actively used &nbsp;by a wide range of threat actors.  Intrusions observed by ASEC involve the unidentified actor scanning port 1433 to check for exposed MS SQL s

Iranian State Broadcaster IRIB Hit by Destructive Wiper Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/iranian-state-broadcaster-irib-hits-by_21.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An investigation into the cyberattack targeting Iranian national media corporation, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), in late January 2022 resulted in the deployment of a wiper malware and other custom implants, as the country's national infrastructure continues to face a&nbsp; wave &nbsp;of&nbsp; attacks &nbsp;aimed at inflicting serious damage.  "This indicates that the attackers' aim was also to disrupt the state's broadcasting networks, with the damage to the TV and radio networks possibly more serious than officially reported," Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.  The 10-second attack, which took place on January 27, involved the breach of state broadcaster IRIB to air pictures of Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization ( MKO ) leaders Maryam and Massoud Rajavi alongside a call for the assassination of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A "potentially destructive actor" aligned with the government of Iran is actively exploiting the well-known&nbsp; Log4j vulnerability &nbsp;to infect unpatched VMware Horizon servers with ransomware.  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne dubbed the group " TunnelVision " owing to their heavy reliance on tunneling tools, with overlaps in tactics observed to that of a broader group tracked under the moniker&nbsp; Phosphorus &nbsp;as well as Charming Kitten and Nemesis Kitten.   "TunnelVision activities are characterized by wide-exploitation of 1-day vulnerabilities in target regions," SentinelOne researchers Amitai Ben Shushan Ehrlich and Yair Rigevsky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report, with the intrusions detected in the Middle East and the U.S.  Also observed alongside Log4Shell is the exploitation of Fortinet FortiOS path traversal flaw ( CVE-2018-13379 ) and the Microsoft Exchange&nbsp; ProxyShell &nbsp;vulnerability to gain initial access into the target networks for post-exploitation.

The politically motivated Moses Staff  hacker group has been observed using a custom multi-component toolset with the goal of carrying out espionage against its targets as part of a new campaign that exclusively singles out Israeli organizations.  First&nbsp; publicly documented &nbsp;in late 2021, Moses Staff is believed to be sponsored by the Iranian government, with attacks reported against entities in Israel, Italy, India, Germany, Chile, Turkey, the U.A.E., and the U.S.  Earlier this month, the hacker collective was observed incorporating a previously undocumented remote access trojan (RAT) called " StrifeWater " that masquerades as the Windows Calculator app to evade detection.   "Close examination reveals that the group has been active for over a year, much earlier than the group's first official public exposure, managing to stay under the radar with an extremely low detection rate," findings from FortiGuard Labs&nbsp; reveal .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the inner workings of ShadowPad , a sophisticated and modular backdoor that has been adopted by a growing number of Chinese threat groups in recent years, while also linking it to the country's civilian and military intelligence agencies.  "ShadowPad is decrypted in memory using a custom decryption algorithm," researchers from Secureworks said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "ShadowPad extracts information about the host, executes commands, interacts with the file system and registry, and deploys new modules to extend functionality."  ShadowPad &nbsp;is a modular malware platform sharing noticeable overlaps to the&nbsp; PlugX &nbsp;malware and which has been put to use in high-profile attacks against NetSarang, CCleaner, and ASUS, causing the operators to shift tactics and update their defensive measures.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously unknown hacking group has been linked to targeted attacks against human rights activists, human rights defenders, academics, and lawyers across India in an attempt to plant "incriminating digital evidence."  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne attributed the intrusions to a group it tracks as " ModifiedElephant ," an elusive threat actor that's been operational since at least 2012, whose activity aligns sharply with Indian state interests.  "ModifiedElephant operates through the use of commercially available remote access trojans (RATs) and has potential ties to the commercial surveillance industry," the researchers&nbsp; said . "The threat actor uses spear-phishing with malicious documents to deliver malware, such as&nbsp; NetWire ,&nbsp; DarkComet , and simple keyloggers."   The primary goal of ModifiedElephant is to facilitate long-term surveillance of targeted individuals, ultimately leading to the delivery of "evidence" on the victim

An advanced persistent threat (APT) group with ties to Iran has refreshed its malware toolset to include a new backdoor dubbed&nbsp; Marlin &nbsp;as part of a long-running espionage campaign that started in April 2018.  Slovak cybersecurity company ESET attributed the attacks — codenamed "Out to Sea" &nbsp;— to a threat actor called&nbsp; OilRig &nbsp;(aka APT34), while also conclusively connecting its activities to a second Iranian group tracked under the name&nbsp; Lyceum &nbsp;(Hexane aka&nbsp; SiameseKitten ).   "Victims of the campaign include diplomatic organizations, technology companies, and medical organizations in Israel, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates," ESET noted in its&nbsp; T3 2021 Threat Report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News.  Active since at least 2014, the hacking group is known to strike Middle Eastern governments and a variety of business verticals, including chemical, energy, financial, and telecommunications.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An advanced persistent threat (APT) hacking group operating with motives that likely align with Palestine has embarked on a new campaign that leverages a previously undocumented implant called NimbleMamba .  The intrusions leveraged a sophisticated attack chain targeting Middle Eastern governments, foreign policy think tanks, and a state-affiliated airline, enterprise security firm Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report, attributing the covert operation to a threat actor tracked as Molerats (aka TA402).  Notorious for continuously updating their malware implants and their delivery methods, the APT group was most recently linked to an&nbsp; espionage offensive &nbsp;aimed at human rights activists and journalists in Palestine and Turkey, while a previous attack exposed in June 2021 resulted in the deployment of a backdoor called&nbsp; LastConn .   But the lull in the activities has been offset by the operators actively working to retool their arsenal, resulting in the development of NimbleMamba, which is desi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning attack campaign has been observed abusing trust in legitimate software utilities to trick users into downloading BATLOADER malware on compromised machines.  "The threat actor used 'free productivity apps installation' or 'free software development tools installation' themes as SEO keywords to lure victims to a compromised website and to download a malicious installer," researchers from Mandiant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week.  In&nbsp; SEO poisoning &nbsp;attacks, adversaries artificially increase the search engine ranking of websites (genuine or otherwise) hosting their malware to make them show up on top of search results so that users searching for specific apps like TeamViewer, Visual Studio, and Zoom are infected with malware.   The installer, while packing the legitimate software, is also bundled with the BATLOADER payload that's executed during the installation process. The malware then acts as a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have turned the spotlight on a new wave of offensive cyberattacks targeting Palestinian activists and entities starting around October 2021 using politically-themed phishing emails and decoy documents.  The intrusions are part of what Cisco Talos calls a longstanding espionage and information theft campaign undertaken by the&nbsp; Arid Viper hacking group &nbsp;using a Delphi-based implant called Micropsia dating all the way back to&nbsp; June 2017 .  The threat actor's&nbsp; activities , also tracked under the monikers Desert Falcon and the APT-C-23, were first documented in&nbsp; February 2015 &nbsp;by Kasperksy and subsequently in 2017, when Qihoo 360 disclosed details of&nbsp; cross-platform &nbsp; backdoors &nbsp;developed by the group to strike Palestinian institutions.   The Russian cybersecurity company-branded Arid Viper the "first exclusively Arabic APT group."  Then in April 2021, Meta (formerly Facebook), which pointed out the group's affiliations to the cyber arm of&nbsp; Hamas

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has disclosed details of a large-scale, multi-phase phishing campaign that uses stolen credentials to register devices on a victim's network to further propagate spam emails and widen the infection pool.  The tech giant said the attacks manifested through accounts that were not secured using multi-factor authentication (MFA), thereby making it possible for the adversary to take advantage of the target's bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy and introduce their own rogue devices using the pilfered credentials.  The attacks took place in two stages. "The first campaign phase involved stealing credentials in target organizations located predominantly in Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand," Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published this week.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented cyber-espionage malware aimed at Apple's macOS operating system leveraged a Safari web browser exploit as part of a watering hole attack targeting politically active, pro-democracy individuals in Hong Kong.  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the intrusion to an actor with "strong technical capabilities," calling out the campaign's overlaps to that of a similar digital offensive&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) in November 2021.  The attack chain involved compromising a legitimate website belonging to D100 Radio, a pro-democracy internet radio station in Hong Kong, to inject malicious inline frames (aka&nbsp; iframes ) between September 30 and November 4, 2021.   In the next phase, the tampered code acted as a conduit to load a&nbsp; Mach-O &nbsp;file by leveraging a remote code execution bug in WebKit that was fixed by Apple in February 2021 ( CVE-2021-1789 ). "The exploit used to gain code execution in the browser is quite

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Latest analysis into the wiper malware that targeted dozens of Ukrainian agencies earlier this month has revealed "strategic similarities" to&nbsp; NotPetya malware &nbsp;that was unleashed against the country's infrastructure and elsewhere in 2017.  The malware, dubbed&nbsp; WhisperGate , was discovered by Microsoft last week, which said it observed the destructive cyber campaign targeting government, non-profit, and information technology entities in the nation, attributing the intrusions to an emerging threat cluster codenamed "DEV-0586."   "While WhisperGate has some strategic similarities to the notorious NotPetya wiper that attacked Ukranian entities in 2017, including masquerading as ransomware and targeting and destroying the master boot record (MBR) instead of encrypting it, it notably has more components designed to inflict additional damage," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report detailing its response efforts.

The coordinated cyberattacks targeting&nbsp; Ukrainian government websites &nbsp;and the deployment of a data-wiper malware called&nbsp; WhisperGate &nbsp;on select government systems are part of a broader wave of malicious activities aimed at&nbsp; sabotaging critical infrastructure &nbsp;in the country.  The Secret Service of Ukraine on Monday confirmed that the two incidents are related, adding the breaches also exploited the recently disclosed&nbsp; Log4j vulnerabilities &nbsp;to gain access to some of the compromised systems.   "The attack used vulnerabilities in the site's content management systems (October CMS) and Log4j, as well as compromised accounts of employees of the development company," the SSU&nbsp; said , corroborating prior disclosure from the&nbsp; Ukraine CERT team .  The disclosure comes days after Microsoft warned of a malware operation aimed at government, non-profit, and information technology entities in Ukraine, attributing the attacks to a threat cluster codenamed "DEV-0586."

A North Korean cyberespionage group named Konni has been linked to a series of targeted attacks aimed at the Russian Federation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MID) with New Year lures to compromise Windows systems with malware.  "This activity cluster demonstrates the patient and persistent nature of advanced actors in waging multi-phased campaigns against perceived high-value networks," researchers from Lumen Technologies' Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis shared with The Hacker News.  The Konni group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are known to overlap with threat actors belonging to the broader&nbsp; Kimsuky &nbsp;umbrella, which is also tracked by the cybersecurity community under the monikers Velvet Chollima, ITG16, Black Banshee, and Thallium.

Microsoft is warning of continuing attempts by nation-state adversaries and commodity attackers to take advantage of&nbsp; security vulnerabilities &nbsp;uncovered in the Log4j open-source logging framework to deploy malware on vulnerable systems.  "Exploitation attempts and testing have remained high during the last weeks of December," Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in revised guidance published earlier this week. "We have observed many existing attackers adding exploits of these vulnerabilities in their existing malware kits and tactics, from coin miners to hands-on-keyboard attacks."  Publicly disclosed by the Apache Software Foundation on December 10, 2021, the remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache Log4j 2, aka&nbsp; Log4Shell , has emerged as a new attack vector for&nbsp; widespread exploitation &nbsp;by a variety of threat actors.

Researchers have demonstrated yet another variant of the SAD DNS cache poisoning attack that leaves about 38% of the domain name resolvers vulnerable, enabling attackers to redirect traffic originally destined to legitimate websites to a server under their control.  "The&nbsp; attack &nbsp;allows an off-path attacker to inject a malicious DNS record into a DNS cache," University of California researchers Keyu Man, Xin'an Zhou, and Zhiyun Qian&nbsp; said . "SAD DNS attack allows an attacker to redirect any traffic (originally destined to a specific domain) to his own server and then become a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker, allowing eavesdropping and tampering of the communication."  The latest flaw affects Linux kernels as well as popular DNS software, including BIND, Unbound, and dnsmasq running on top of Linux, but not when run on other operating systems FreeBSD or Windows.  From Kaminsky Attack to SAD DNS  DNS cache poisoning, also called DNS spoofing, is a&nbsp; technique &nbsp;i

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Lazarus Group, the advanced persistent threat (APT) group attributed to the North Korean government, has been observed waging two separate supply chain attack campaigns as a means to gain a foothold into corporate networks and target a wide range of downstream entities.  The latest intelligence-gathering operation involved the use of MATA malware framework as well as backdoors dubbed&nbsp; BLINDINGCAN &nbsp;and&nbsp; COPPERHEDGE &nbsp;to attack the defense industry, an IT asset monitoring solution vendor based in Latvia, and a think tank located in South Korea, according to a new&nbsp; Q3 2021 APT Trends report &nbsp;published by Kaspersky.   In one instance, the supply-chain attack originated from an infection chain that stemmed from legitimate South Korean security software running a malicious payload, leading to the deployment of the BLINDINGCAN and COPPERHEDGE malware on the think tank's network in June 2021. The other attack on the Latvian company in May is an "atypical victim" for Lazarus, the

NYT Journalist Repeatedly Hacked with Pegasus after Reporting on Saudi Arabia<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/nyt-journalist-repeatedly-hacked-with.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The iPhone of New York Times journalist Ben Hubbard was repeatedly hacked with NSO Group's Pegasus spyware tool over a three-year period stretching between June 2018 to June 2021, resulting in infections twice in July 2020 and June 2021.  The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which&nbsp; publicized &nbsp;the findings on Sunday, said the "targeting took place while he was reporting on Saudi Arabia, and writing a book about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman." The research institute did not attribute the infiltrations to a specific government.  In a&nbsp; statement &nbsp;shared with Hubbard, the Israeli company denied its involvement in the hacks and dismissed the findings as "speculation," while noting that the journalist was not "a target of Pegasus by any of NSO's customers."   To date, NSO Group is believed to have leveraged at least three different iOS exploits — namely an iMessage zero-click exploit in December 2019, a&nbsp; KISMET &nbsp;exploit targeting iOS 13

'Lone Wolf' Hacker Group Targeting Afghanistan and India with Commodity RATs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/lone-wolf-hacker-group-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware campaign targeting Afghanistan and India is exploiting a now-patched, 20-year-old flaw affecting Microsoft Office to deploy an array of commodity remote access trojans (RATs) that allow the adversary to gain complete control over the compromised endpoints.  Cisco Talos attributed the cyber campaign to a "lone wolf" threat actor operating a Lahore-based fake IT company called Bunse Technologies as a front to carry out the malicious activities, while also having a history of sharing content that's in favor of Pakistan and Taliban dating all the way back to 2016.   The attacks work by taking advantage of political and government-themed lure domains that host the malware payloads, with the infection chains leveraging weaponized RTF documents and PowerShell scripts that distribute malware to victims. Specifically, the laced RTF files were found exploiting&nbsp; CVE-2017-11882 &nbsp;to execute a PowerShell command that's responsible for deploying additional malware to

A New Wave of Malware Attack Targeting Organizations in South America<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/a-new-wave-of-malware-attack-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A spam campaign delivering spear-phishing emails aimed at South American organizations has retooled its techniques to include a wide range of commodity remote access trojans (RATs) and geolocation filtering to avoid detection, according to new research.  Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro attributed the attacks to an advanced persistent threat (APT) tracked as&nbsp; APT-C-36 &nbsp;(aka Blind Eagle), a suspected South America espionage group that has been active since at least 2018 and&nbsp; previously known &nbsp;for setting its sights on Colombian government institutions and corporations spanning financial, petroleum, and manufacturing sectors.   Primarily spread via fraudulent emails by masquerading as Colombian government agencies, such as the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs (DIAN), the infection chain commences when the message recipients open a decoy PDF or Word document that claims to be a seizure order tied to their bank accounts and click on a link that's been generated from a URL short

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A targeted phishing campaign aimed at the aviation industry for two years may be spearheaded by a threat actor operating out of Nigeria, highlighting how attackers can carry out small-scale cyber offensives for extended periods of time while staying under the radar.  Cisco Talos dubbed the malware attacks "Operation Layover," building on&nbsp; previous research &nbsp;from the Microsoft Security Intelligence team in May 2021 that delved into a "dynamic campaign targeting the aerospace and travel sectors with spear-phishing emails that distribute an actively developed loader, which then delivers RevengeRAT or AsyncRAT."   "The actor […] doesn't seem to be technically sophisticated, using off-the-shelf malware since the beginning of its activities without developing its own malware," researchers Tiago Pereira and Vitor Ventura&nbsp; said . "The actor also buys the crypters that allow the usage of such malware without being detected, throughout the years it has use

A newly discovered side-channel attack demonstrated on modern processors can be weaponized to successfully overcome&nbsp; Site Isolation protections &nbsp;weaved into Google Chrome and Chromium browsers and leak sensitive data in a&nbsp; Spectre-style &nbsp; speculative execution &nbsp;attack.  Dubbed " Spook.js " by academics from the University of Michigan, University of Adelaide, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Tel Aviv University, the technique is a&nbsp; JavaScript-based line of attack &nbsp;that specifically aims to get around barriers Google put in place after Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities came to light in January 2018, thereby potentially preventing leakage by ensuring that content from different domains is not shared in the same address space.

Experts Uncover Mobile Spyware Attacks Targeting Kurdish Ethnic Group<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/experts-uncover-mobile-spyware-attacks.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday released new findings that reveal a year-long mobile espionage campaign against the Kurdish ethnic group to deploy two Android backdoors that masquerade as legitimate apps.  Active since at least March 2020, the attacks leveraged as many as six dedicated Facebook profiles that claimed to offer tech and pro-Kurd content — two aimed at Android users while the other four appeared to provide news for the Kurdish supporters — only to share links to spying apps on public Facebook groups. All the six profiles have since been taken down.  "It targeted the Kurdish ethnic group through at least 28 malicious Facebook posts that would lead potential victims to download Android 888 RAT or SpyNote," ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko&nbsp; said . "Most of the malicious Facebook posts led to downloads of the commercial, multi-platform 888 RAT, which has been available on the black market since 2018."   The Slovakian cybersecurity firm attributed the at

Microsoft's Active Directory is&nbsp; said to be used by 95% &nbsp;of Fortune 500. As a result, it is a prime target for attackers as they look to gain access to credentials in the organization, as compromised credentials provide one of the easiest ways for hackers to access your data.  A key authentication technology that underpins Microsoft Active Directory is Kerberos. Unfortunately, hackers use many different attacks against Active Directory's implementation of the Kerberos authentication protocol. One of those is AS-REP Roasting. So what is AS-REP Roasting, and how can businesses protect themselves?  What is Active Directory Kerberos?  Kerberos was originally developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and centered around using tickets to establish trust. Microsoft's implementation of Kerberos found in Active Directory is based on Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5) as defined in&nbsp; RFC 4120 . However, Microsoft has added to and enhanced Kerberos with it

Microsoft is warning of a widespread credential phishing campaign that leverages&nbsp; open redirector links &nbsp;in email communications as a vector to trick users into visiting malicious websites while effectively bypassing security software.  "Attackers combine these links with social engineering baits that impersonate well-known productivity tools and services to lure users into clicking," Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week.   "Doing so leads to a series of redirections — including a CAPTCHA verification page that adds a sense of legitimacy and attempts to evade some automated analysis systems — before taking the user to a fake sign-in page. This ultimately leads to credential compromise, which opens the user and their organization to other attacks."  Although redirect links in email messages serve a vital tool to take recipients to third-party websites or track click rates and measure the success of sales and marketin

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is warning of active exploitation attempts that leverage the latest line of " ProxyShell " Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities that were patched earlier this May, including deploying LockFile ransomware on compromised systems.  Tracked as CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207, the vulnerabilities enable adversaries to bypass ACL controls, elevate privileges on the Exchange PowerShell backend, effectively permitting the attacker to perform unauthenticated, remote code execution. While the former two were addressed by Microsoft on April 13, a patch for CVE-2021-31207 was shipped as part of the Windows maker's May Patch Tuesday updates.   "An attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable machine," CISA&nbsp; said .  The development comes a little over a week after cybersecurity researchers sounded the alarm on&nbsp; opportunistic scanning and exploitation &nbsp;of unpat

A novel technique leverages optical emanations from a device's power indicator LED to recover sounds from connected peripherals and spy on electronic conversations from a distance of as much as 35 meters.  Dubbed the " Glowworm attack ," the findings were published by a group of academics from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev earlier this week, describing the method as "an optical&nbsp; TEMPEST &nbsp;attack that can be used by eavesdroppers to recover sound by analysing optical measurements obtained via an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of various devices."  Accompanying the experimental setup is an optical-audio transformation (OAT) that allows for retrieving sound by isolating the speech from the optical measurements obtained by directing an electro-optical sensor at the device's power indicator LED.   TEMPEST is the codename for unintentional intelligence-bearing emanations produced by electronic and electromechanical information-

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. is presently combating two pandemics--coronavirus and ransomware attacks. Both have partially shut down parts of the economy. However, in the case of cybersecurity, lax security measures allow hackers to have an easy way to rake in millions.  It's pretty simple for hackers to gain financially, using malicious software to access and encrypt data and hold it hostage until the victim pays the ransom.  Cyber attacks are more frequent now because it is effortless for hackers to execute them. Further, the payment methods are now friendlier to them. In addition, businesses are&nbsp; willing to pay a ransom &nbsp;because of the growing reliance on digital infrastructure, giving hackers more incentives to attempt more breaches.&nbsp;  Bolder cybercriminals  A few years back, cybercriminals played psychological games before getting bank passwords and using their technical know-how to steal money from people's accounts.

IT Giant Accenture Hit by LockBit Ransomware; Hackers Threaten to Leak Data<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/it-giant-accenture-hit-by-lockbit.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Global IT consultancy giant Accenture has become the latest company to be hit by the LockBit ransomware gang, according to a post made by the operators on their dark web portal, likely filling a void left in the wake of DarkSide and REvil shutdown.  "These people are beyond privacy and security. I really hope that their services are better than what I saw as an insider," read a message posted on the data leak website. Accenture&nbsp; said &nbsp;it has since restored the affected systems from backups.   LockBit, like its now-defunct DarkSide and REvil counterparts, operates using a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, roping in other cybercriminals (aka affiliates) to carry out the intrusion using its platform, with the payments often divided between the criminal entity directing the attack and the core developers of the malware.   The ransomware group emerged on the threat landscape in September 2019, and in June 2021 launched LockBit 2.0 along with an advertising campaign to recruit

An amalgam of multiple state-sponsored threat groups from China may have been behind a string of targeted attacks against Russian federal executive authorities in 2020.  The latest research, published by Singapore-headquartered company Group-IB, delves into a piece of computer virus called " Webdav-O " that was detected in the intrusions, with the cybersecurity firm observing similarities between the tool and that of popular Trojan called " BlueTraveller ," that's known to be connected to a Chinese threat group called TaskMasters and deployed in malicious activities with the aim of espionage and plundering confidential documents.   "Chinese APTs are one of the most numerous and aggressive hacker communities," researchers Anastasia Tikhonova and Dmitry Kupin&nbsp; said .

A threat actor presumed to be of Chinese origin has been linked to a series of 10 attacks targeting Mongolia, Russia, Belarus, Canada, and the U.S. from January to July 2021 that involve the deployment of a remote access trojan (RAT) on infected systems, according to new research.  The intrusions have been attributed to an advanced persistent threat named&nbsp;APT31&nbsp;(FireEye), which is tracked by the cybersecurity community under the monikers Zirconium (Microsoft), Judgement Panda (CrowdStrike), and Bronze Vinewood (Secureworks).   The group is a "China-nexus cyber espionage actor focused on obtaining information that can provide the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises with political, economic, and military advantages,"&nbsp; according &nbsp;to FireEye.  Positive Technologies, in a&nbsp; write-up &nbsp;published Tuesday, revealed a new malware dropper that was used to facilitate the attacks, including the retrieval of next-stage encrypted payloads from a remote command-and-control server,

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly uncovered security flaw in the Windows operating system can be exploited to coerce remote Windows servers, including Domain Controllers, to authenticate with a malicious destination, thereby allowing an adversary to stage an&nbsp; NTLM relay attack &nbsp;and completely take over a Windows domain.  The issue, dubbed " PetitPotam ," was discovered by security researcher Gilles Lionel, who shared technical details and proof-of-concept (PoC) code last week, noting that the flaw works by forcing "Windows hosts to authenticate to other machines via MS-EFSRPC EfsRpcOpenFileRaw function."  MS-EFSRPC &nbsp;is Microsoft's Encrypting File System Remote Protocol that's used to perform "maintenance and management operations on encrypted data that is stored remotely and accessed over a network."   Specifically, the attack enables a domain controller to authenticate against a remote NTLM under a bad actor's control using the MS-EFSRPC interface and share its authen

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Tuesday disclosed that the latest string of attacks targeting SolarWinds Serv-U managed file transfer service with a now-patched remote code execution (RCE) exploit is the handiwork of a Chinese threat actor dubbed "DEV-0322."  The revelation comes days after the Texas-based IT monitoring software maker issued fixes for the flaw that could enable adversaries to remotely run arbitrary code with privileges, allowing them to perform actions like install and run malicious payloads or view and alter sensitive data.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-35211 , the RCE flaw resides in Serv-U's implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. While it was previously revealed that the attacks were limited in scope, SolarWinds said it's "unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers."   Attributing the intrusions with high confidence to DEV-0322 (short for "Development Group 0322") based on observed victimology, tactics, and procedures, Micr

Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday took the wraps off a new, ongoing espionage campaign targeting corporate networks in Spanish-speaking countries, specifically Venezuela, to spy on its victims.  Dubbed " Bandidos " by ESET owing to the use of an upgraded variant of Bandook malware, the primary targets of the threat actor are corporate networks in the South American country spanning across manufacturing, construction, healthcare, software services, and retail sectors.  Written in both Delphi and C++,&nbsp; Bandook &nbsp;has a history of being sold as a commercial remote access trojan (RAT) dating all the way back to 2005. Since then, numerous variants have emerged on the threat landscape and put to use in different surveillance campaigns in 2015 and 2017, allegedly by a cyber-mercenary group known as Dark Caracal on behalf of government interests in Kazakhstan and Lebanon.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. technology firm Kaseya, which is firefighting the largest ever&nbsp; supply-chain ransomware strike &nbsp;on its VSA on-premises product, ruled out the possibility that its codebase was unauthorizedly tampered with to distribute malware.  While initial reports raised speculations that the ransomware gang might have gained access to Kaseya's backend infrastructure and abused it to deploy a malicious update to VSA servers running on client premises, in a modus operandi similar to that of the devastating SolarWinds hack, it has since emerged that a never-before-seen security vulnerability ( CVE-2021-30116 ) in the software was leveraged to push ransomware to Kaseya's customers.   "The attackers were able to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in the VSA product to bypass authentication and run arbitrary command execution," the Miami-headquartered company&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in the incident analysis. "This allowed the attackers to leverage the standard VSA product functionality to depl

Taiwanese networking equipment company Zyxel is warning customers of an ongoing attack targeting a "small subset" of its security products such as firewall and VPN servers.  Attributing the attacks to a "sophisticated threat actor," the firm noted that the attacks single out appliances that have remote management or SSL VPN enabled, namely in the USG/ZyWALL, USG FLEX, ATP, and VPN series running on-premise ZLD firmware, implying that the targeted devices are publicly accessible over the internet.   "The threat actor attempts to access a device through WAN; if successful, they then bypass authentication and establish SSL VPN tunnels with unknown user accounts, such as 'zyxel_slIvpn', 'zyxel_ts', or 'zyxel_vpn_test', to manipulate the device's configuration," Zyxel said in an&nbsp; email message , which was shared on Twitter.

Malware Attack on South Korean Entities Was Work of Andariel Group<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/malware-attack-on-south-korean-entities.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malware campaign targeting South Korean entities that came to light earlier this year has been attributed to a North Korean nation-state hacking group called Andariel, once again indicating that&nbsp; Lazarus &nbsp;attackers are following the trends and their&nbsp; arsenal &nbsp;is in&nbsp; constant development .  "The way Windows commands and their options were used in this campaign is almost identical to previous Andariel activity," Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep-dive published Tuesday. Victims of the attack are in the manufacturing, home network service, media, and construction sectors.   Designated as part of the Lazarus constellation, Andariel is known for unleashing attacks on South Korean organizations and businesses using specifically tailored methods created for maximum effectivity. In September 2019, the sub-group, along with Lazarus and Bluenoroff, was&nbsp; sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department &nbsp;for their malicious cyber activity on critical infrastructure.  Anda

NoxPlayer Supply-Chain Attack is Likely the Work of Gelsemium Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/noxplayer-supply-chain-attack-is-likely.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new cyber espionage group named Gelsemium has been linked to a&nbsp; supply chain attack targeting the NoxPlayer &nbsp;Android emulator that was disclosed earlier this year.  The findings come from a systematic analysis of multiple campaigns undertaken by the APT crew, with evidence of the earliest attack dating back all the way to 2014 under the codename&nbsp; Operation TooHash &nbsp;based on malware payloads deployed in those intrusions.  "Victims of these campaigns are located in East Asia as well as the Middle East and include governments, religious organizations, electronics manufacturers and universities," cybersecurity firm ESET&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week.   "Gelsemium's whole chain might appear simple at first sight, but the exhaustive configurations, implanted at each stage, modify on-the-fly settings for the final payload, making it harder to understand."  Targeted countries include China, Mongolia, North and South Korea, Japan, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Saudi

New TLS Attack Lets Attackers Launch Cross-Protocol Attacks Against Secure Sites<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/new-tls-attack-lets-attackers-launch.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed a new type of attack that exploits misconfigurations in transport layer security (TLS) servers to redirect HTTPS traffic from a victim's web browser to a different TLS service endpoint located on another IP address to steal sensitive information.  The attacks have been dubbed&nbsp; ALPACA , short for "Application Layer Protocol Confusion - Analyzing and mitigating Cracks in tls Authentication," by a group of academics from Ruhr University Bochum, Münster University of Applied Sciences, and Paderborn University.  "Attackers can redirect traffic from one subdomain to another, resulting in a valid TLS session," the study said. "This breaks the authentication of TLS and cross-protocol attacks may be possible where the behavior of one protocol service may compromise the other at the application layer."  TLS &nbsp;is a cryptographic protocol underpinning several application layer protocols like HTTPS, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP to secure com

Crypto-Mining Attacks Targeting Kubernetes Clusters via Kubeflow Instances<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/crypto-mining-attacks-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed a new large-scale campaign targeting Kubeflow deployments to run malicious cryptocurrency mining containers.  The campaign involved deploying&nbsp; TensorFlow &nbsp;pods on Kubernetes clusters, with the pods running legitimate&nbsp; TensorFlow images &nbsp;from the official Docker Hub account. However, the container images were configured to execute rogue commands that mine cryptocurrencies. Microsoft said the deployments witnessed an uptick towards the end of May.   Kubeflow &nbsp;is an open-source machine learning platform designed to deploy machine learning workflows on&nbsp; Kubernetes , an orchestration service used for managing and scaling containerized workloads across a cluster of machines.  The deployment, in itself, was achieved by taking advantage of Kubeflow, which exposes its UI functionality via a dashboard that is deployed in the cluster. In the attack observed by Microsoft, the adversaries used the centralized dashboard as an ingress point to create a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
State-sponsored hackers affiliated with North Korea have been behind a slew of attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges  over the past three years, new evidence has revealed.  Attributing the attack with "medium-high" likelihood to the Lazarus Group (aka APT38 or Hidden Cobra), researchers from Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky said the campaign, dubbed " CryptoCore ," targeted crypto exchanges in Israel, Japan, Europe, and the U.S., resulting in the theft of millions of dollars worth of virtual currencies.   The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;are a consequence of piecing together artifacts from a series of isolated but similar reports detailed by&nbsp; F-Secure , Japanese CERT&nbsp; JPCERT/CC , and&nbsp; NTT Security &nbsp;over the past few months.  Since emerging on the scene in 2009,&nbsp; Hidden Cobra &nbsp;actors have used their offensive cyber capabilities to carry out espionage and cyber cryptocurrency heists against businesses and critical infrastructure.

Insurance Firm CNA Financial Reportedly Paid Hackers $40 Million in Ransom<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/insurance-firm-cna-financial-reportedly.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. insurance giant CNA Financial reportedly paid $40 million to a ransomware gang to recover access to its systems following an attack in March, making it one the most expensive ransoms paid to date.  The development was first&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by Bloomberg, citing "people with knowledge of the attack." The adversary that staged the intrusion is said to have allegedly demanded $60 million a week after the Chicago-based company began negotiations with the hackers, culminating in the payment two weeks following the theft of company data.  In a statement shared on May 12, CNA Financial&nbsp; said &nbsp;it had "no evidence to indicate that external customers were potentially at risk of infection due to the incident."   The attack has been attributed to new ransomware known as 'Phoenix CryptoLocker,' according to a&nbsp; March report &nbsp;from Bleeping Computer, with the strain believed to be an offshoot of&nbsp; WastedLocker &nbsp;and Hades, both of which have been utilized by&nbsp; Evil Corp , a Ru

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An investigation undertaken in the aftermath of the&nbsp; Oldsmar water plant hack &nbsp;earlier this year has revealed that an infrastructure contractor in the U.S. state of Florida hosted malicious code on its website in what's known as a watering hole attack.  "This malicious code seemingly targeted water utilities, particularly in Florida, and more importantly, was visited by a browser from the city of Oldsmar on the same day of the poisoning event," Dragos researcher Kent Backman&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published on Tuesday.  The site, which belongs to a Florida-based general contractor involved in building water and wastewater treatment facilities, had no bearing on the intrusion, the American industrial cybersecurity firm said.   Watering hole attacks typically allow an adversary to compromise a specific group of end-users by compromising a carefully selected website, which members of that group are known to visit, with an intention to gain access to the victim's system an

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A financially motivated cybercrime gang has unleashed a previously undocumented banking trojan, which can steal credentials from customers of 70 banks located in various European and South American countries.  Dubbed " Bizarro " by Kaspersky researchers, the Windows malware is "using affiliates or recruiting money mules to operationalize their attacks, cashing out or simply to helping [sic] with transfers."  The campaign consists of multiple moving parts, chief among them being the ability to trick users into entering two-factor authentication codes in fake pop-up windows that are then sent to the attackers, as well as its reliance on social engineering lures to convince visitors of banking websites into downloading a malicious smartphone app.   Bizarro, which uses compromised WordPress, Amazon, and Azure servers to host the malware, is distributed via MSI packages downloaded by victims from sketchy links in spam emails.

New Browser Attack Allows Tracking Users Online With JavaScript Disabled<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/new-browser-attack-allows-tracking.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have discovered a new side-channel that they say can be reliably exploited to leak information from web browsers that could then be leveraged to track users even when JavaScript is completely disabled.  "This is a side-channel attack which doesn't require any JavaScript to run," the researchers said. "This means script blockers cannot stop it. The attacks work even if you strip out all of the fun parts of the web browsing experience. This makes it very difficult to prevent without modifying deep parts of the operating system."  In avoiding JavaScript, the side-channel attacks are also architecturally agnostic, resulting in microarchitectural website fingerprinting attacks that work across hardware platforms, including Intel Core, AMD Ryzen, Samsung Exynos 2100, and Apple M1 CPUs — making it the first known side-channel attack on the iPhone maker's new ARM-based chipsets.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Friday warned of active attacks exploiting unpatched Exchange Servers carried out by multiple threat actors, as the hacking campaign is believed to have infected tens of thousands of businesses, government entities in the U.S., Asia, and Europe.  The company&nbsp; said &nbsp;"it continues to see increased use of these vulnerabilities in attacks targeting unpatched systems by multiple malicious actors beyond HAFNIUM," signaling an escalation that the breaches are no longer "limited and targeted" as was previously deemed.  According to independent cybersecurity journalist&nbsp; Brian Krebs , at least 30,000 entities across the U.S. — mainly small businesses, towns, cities, and local governments — have been compromised by an "unusually aggressive" Chinese group that has set its sights on stealing emails from victim organizations by exploiting previously undisclosed flaws in Exchange Server.   Victims are also being reported from outside the U.S., with email sy

In what's a case of hackers getting hacked, a prominent underground online criminal forum by the name of Maza has been compromised by unknown attackers, making it the fourth forum to have been breached since the start of the year.  The intrusion is said to have occurred on March 3, with information about the forum members — including usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords — publicly disclosed on a breach notification page put up by the attackers, stating "Your data has been leaked" and "This forum has been hacked."  "The announcement was accompanied by a PDF file allegedly containing a portion of forum user data. The file comprised more than 3,000 rows, containing usernames, partially obfuscated password hashes, email addresses and other contact details," cybersecurity firm Intel 471&nbsp; said .

SolarWinds Blames Intern for Weak Password That Led to Biggest Attack in 2020<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/solarwinds-blame-intern-for-weak.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As cybersecurity researchers continue to piece together the sprawling&nbsp; SolarWinds supply chain attack , top executives of the Texas-based software services firm blamed an intern for a critical password lapse that went unnoticed for several years.&nbsp;  The said password " solarwinds123 " was originally believed to have been publicly accessible via a GitHub repository since June 17, 2018, before the misconfiguration was addressed on November 22, 2019.  But in a&nbsp; hearing &nbsp;before the House Committees on Oversight and Reform and Homeland Security on SolarWinds on Friday, CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna testified that the password had been in use as early as 2017.  While a preliminary investigation into the attack revealed that the operators behind the espionage campaign managed to compromise the software build and code signing infrastructure of SolarWinds Orion platform as early as October 2019 to deliver the Sunburst backdoor, Crowdstrike's incident response efforts pointed to a&nbsp; revi

Experts Warns of Notable Increase in QuickBooks Data Files Theft Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/experts-warns-of-notable-increase-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has uncovered a significant increase in QuickBooks file data theft using social engineering tricks to deliver malware and exploit the accounting software.  "A majority of the time, the attack involves basic malware that is often signed, making it hard to detect using antivirus or other threat detection software," researchers from ThreatLocker said in an analysis shared today with The Hacker News.  QuickBooks is an accounting software package developed and marketed by Intuit.   The spear-phishing attacks take the form of a PowerShell command that's capable of running inside of the email, the researchers said, adding, a second attack vector involves decoy documents sent via email messages that, when opened, runs a macro to download malicious code which uploads QuickBooks files to an attacker-controlled server.  Alternatively, bad actors have also been spotted running a PowerShell command called&nbsp; Invoke-WebRequests &nbsp;on target systems to upload relevant data to

Shadow Attacks Let Attackers Replace Content in Digitally Signed PDFs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/shadow-attacks-let-attackers-replace.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have demonstrated a novel class of attacks that could allow a bad actor to potentially circumvent existing countermeasures and break the integrity protection of digitally signed PDF documents.  Called " Shadow attacks " by academics from Ruhr-University Bochum, the technique uses the "enormous flexibility provided by the PDF specification so that shadow documents remain standard-compliant."  The findings were presented yesterday at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), with 16 of the 29 PDF viewers tested — including Adobe Acrobat, Foxit Reader, Perfect PDF, and Okular — found vulnerable to shadow attacks.  To carry out the attack, a malicious actor creates a PDF document with two different contents: one which is the content that's expected by the party signing the document, and the other, a piece of hidden content that gets displayed once the PDF is signed.  "The signers of the PDF receive the document, review it, and s

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a&nbsp;novel attack&nbsp;that could allow criminals to trick a point of sale terminal into transacting with a victim's Mastercard contactless card while believing it to be a Visa card.  The research, published by a group of academics from the ETH Zurich, builds on a study&nbsp; detailed last September &nbsp;that delved into a PIN bypass attack, permitting bad actors to leverage a victim's stolen or lost Visa EMV-enabled credit card for making high-value purchases without knowledge of the card's PIN, and even fool the terminal into accepting unauthentic offline card transactions.  "This is not just a mere card brand mixup but it has critical consequences," researchers David Basin, Ralf Sasse, and Jorge Toro said. "For example, criminals can use it in combination with the previous attack on Visa to also bypass the PIN for Mastercard cards. The cards of this brand were previously presumed protected by PIN."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New details have emerged about the remote computer intrusion at a Florida water treatment  facility last Friday, highlighting a lack of adequate security measures needed to bulletproof critical infrastructure environments.  The breach, which occurred last Friday, involved an&nbsp; unsuccessful attempt &nbsp;on the part of an adversary to increase sodium hydroxide dosage in the water supply to dangerous levels by remotely accessing the SCADA system at the water treatment plant. The system's plant operator, who spotted the intrusion, quickly took steps to reverse the command, leading to minimal impact.   Now, according to an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;published on Wednesday by the state of Massachusetts, unidentified cyber actors accessed the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system via TeamViewer software installed on one of the plant's several computers that were connected to the control system.  Not only were these computers running 32-bit versions of the Windows 7 operating system, but

Dependency Confusion Supply-Chain Attack Hit Over 35 High-Profile Companies<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/dependency-confusion-supply-chain.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's a novel supply chain attack, a security researcher managed to breach over 35 major companies' internal systems, including that of Microsoft, Apple, PayPal, Shopify, Netflix, Yelp, Tesla, and Uber, and achieve remote code execution.  The technique, called dependency confusion  or a substitution attack, takes advantage of the fact that a piece of software may include components from a mix of private and public sources.  These external package dependencies, which are fetched from public repositories during a build process, can pose an attack opportunity when an adversary uploads a higher version of a private module to the public feed, causing a client to automatically download the bogus "latest" version without requiring any action from the developer.   "From one-off mistakes made by developers on their own machines, to misconfigured internal or cloud-based build servers, to systemically vulnerable development pipelines, one thing was clear: squatting val

A newly devised variant of the&nbsp; NAT Slipstreaming attack &nbsp;can be leveraged to compromise and expose any device in an internal network, according to the latest research.  Detailed by enterprise IoT security firm Armis, the&nbsp; new attack &nbsp;(CVE-2020-16043 and CVE-2021-23961) builds on the previously disclosed technique to bypass routers and firewalls and reach any unmanaged device within the internal network from the Internet.  First&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by security researcher Samy Kamkar in late October 2020, the JavaScript-based attack relied on luring a user into visiting a malicious website to circumvent browser-based port restrictions and allow the attacker to remotely access TCP/UDP services on the victim's device, even those that were protected by a firewall or NAT.   Although partial mitigations were released on November 11 to thwart the attack in&nbsp; Chrome 87 ,&nbsp; Firefox 84 , and&nbsp; Safari &nbsp;by preventing connections on port 5060 or 5061, Armis researchers Ben Seri and Gregory Vishnipolsky r

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Hardware security keys—such as those from Google and Yubico—are considered the most secure means to protect accounts from phishing and takeover attacks.  But a new research published on Thursday demonstrates how an adversary in possession of such a two-factor authentication (2FA) device can clone it by exploiting an electromagnetic side-channel in the chip embedded in it.  The vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2021-3011 ) allows the bad actor to extract the encryption key or the&nbsp; ECDSA &nbsp;private key linked to a victim's account from a FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) device like Google Titan Key or YubiKey, thus completely undermining the 2FA protections.  "The adversary can sign in to the victim's application account without the U2F device, and without the victim noticing," NinjaLab researchers Victor Lomne and Thomas Roche&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a 60-page analysis.   "In other words the adversary created a clone of the U2F device for the victim's application account. This cl
