Malicious Python Package Uses Unicode Trickery to Evade Detection and Steal Data<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/malicious-python-package-uses-unicode.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious Python package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository has been found to use Unicode as a trick to evade detection and deploy an info-stealing malware. The package in question, named  onyxproxy , was uploaded to PyPI on March 15, 2023, and comes with capabilities to harvest and exfiltrate credentials and other valuable data. It has since been taken down, but not before attracting a total of  183 downloads . According to software supply chain security firm Phylum, the package incorporates its malicious behavior in a setup script that's packed with thousands of seemingly legitimate code strings. These strings include a mix of bold and italic fonts and are still readable and can be parsed by the Python interpreter, only to activate the execution of the stealer malware upon installation of the package.  "An obvious and immediate benefit of this strange scheme is readability," the company  noted . "Moreover, these visible differences do not prevent

Any app that can improve business operations is quickly added to the SaaS stack. However, employees don't realize that this SaaS-to-SaaS connectivity, which typically takes place outside the view of the security team, significantly increases risk. Whether employees connect through Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, Salesforce, or any other app, security teams have no way to quantify their exposure. These 'secondary' apps can be requesting an intrusive set of permissions or be malicious. Every click authorizing access may grant the right to edit or delete company files, send emails on behalf of the user, create new files, or otherwise handle data in a way that poses a profound threat to the organization's security. To handle the SaaS Security challenges, security teams need to address the entire SaaS ecosystem.  Today's SaaS security evolution has expanded SaaS security beyond simply preventing access. It extends far beyond securing the app. Today's orga

Cloud-based repository hosting service GitHub said it took the step of replacing its RSA SSH host key used to secure Git operations "out of an abundance of caution" after it was briefly exposed in a public repository. The activity, which was carried out at 05:00 UTC on March 24, 2023, is said to have been undertaken as a measure to prevent any bad actor from impersonating the service or eavesdropping on users' operations over SSH. "This key does not grant access to GitHub's infrastructure or customer data," Mike Hanley, chief security officer and SVP of engineering at GitHub,  said  in a post. "This change only impacts Git operations over SSH using RSA." The move does not impact Web traffic to GitHub.com and Git operations performed via HTTPS. No change is required for ECDSA or Ed25519 users. The Microsoft-owned company said there is no evidence that the exposed SSH private key was exploited by adversaries.

A recent campaign undertaken by  Earth Preta  indicates that nation-state groups aligned with China are getting increasingly proficient at bypassing security solutions. The  threat actor , active since at least 2012, is tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under Bronze President, HoneyMyte, Mustang Panda, RedDelta, and Red Lich. Attack chains mounted by the group commence with a spear-phishing email to deploy a wide range of tools for backdoor access, command-and-control (C2), and data exfiltration. These messages come bearing with malicious lure archives distributed via Dropbox or Google Drive links that employ DLL side-loading, LNK shortcut files, and fake file extensions as arrival vectors to obtain a foothold and drop backdoors like  TONEINS, TONESHELL, PUBLOAD , and  MQsTTang  (aka QMAGENT). Similar infection chains utilizing Google Drive links have been observed  delivering Cobalt Strike  as early as April 2021. "Earth Preta tends to hide malicious payloads

Patches have been released for a critical security flaw impacting the WooCommerce Payments plugin for WordPress, which is installed on over 500,000 websites. The flaw, if left unresolved, could enable a bad actor to gain unauthorized admin access to impacted stores, the company said in an advisory on March 23, 2023. It impacts versions 4.8.0 through 5.6.1. Put differently, the issue could permit an "unauthenticated attacker to impersonate an administrator and completely take over a website without any user interaction or social engineering required," WordPress security company Wordfence  said . The vulnerability appears to reside in a PHP file called "class-platform-checkout-session.php," Sucuri researcher Ben Martin  noted . Credited with discovering and reporting the vulnerability is Michael Mazzolini of Swiss penetration testing company GoldNetwork.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has stepped in to remove a bogus Chrome browser extension from the official Web Store that masqueraded as OpenAI's ChatGPT service to harvest Facebook session cookies and hijack the accounts. The "ChatGPT For Google" extension, a trojanized version of a  legitimate open source browser add-on , attracted over 9,000 installations since March 14, 2023, prior to its removal. It was originally uploaded to the Chrome Web Store on February 14, 2023. According to  Guardio Labs  researcher Nati Tal, the extension is propagated through  malicious   sponsored Google search results  that are designed to redirect unsuspecting users searching for "Chat GPT-4" to fraudulent landing pages that point to the fake add-on. Installing the extension adds the promised functionality – i.e., enhancing search engines with ChatGPT – but it also stealthily activates the ability to capture Facebook-related cookies and exfiltrate it to a remote server in an encrypted manner.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An emerging Android banking trojan dubbed  Nexus  has already been adopted by several threat actors to target 450 financial applications and conduct fraud. "Nexus appears to be in its early stages of development," Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy  said  in a report published this week. "Nexus provides all the main features to perform ATO attacks (Account Takeover) against banking portals and cryptocurrency services, such as credentials stealing and SMS interception." The trojan, which appeared in various hacking forums at the start of the year, is advertised as a subscription service to its clientele for a monthly fee of $3,000. Details of the malware were  first documented  by Cyble earlier this month. However, there are indications that the malware may have been used in real-world attacks as early as June 2022, at least six months before its official announcement on darknet portals.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In 2022 alone, global cyberattacks increased by 38%, resulting in substantial business loss, including financial and reputational damage. Meanwhile, corporate security budgets have risen significantly because of the growing sophistication of attacks and the number of cybersecurity solutions introduced into the market. With this rise in threats, budgets, and solutions, how prepared are industries and countries to effectively address today's cyber risk?  CYE's new  Cybersecurity Maturity Report 2023  tackles this question by shedding light on the strength of cybersecurity in different sectors, company sizes, and countries. It highlights which industries and countries have the most robust cyber postures and which are lagging, as well as the most prevalent vulnerabilities in today's cyber threat landscape. The analysis is based on two years' worth of data, collected from over 500 organizations in 15 countries, and spanning 11 industries and a range of company sizes. It measures cybersec

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Telecommunication providers in the Middle East are the subject of new cyber attacks that commenced in the first quarter of 2023. The intrusion set has been attributed to a Chinese cyber espionage actor associated with a long-running campaign dubbed  Operation Soft Cell  based on tooling overlaps. "The initial attack phase involves infiltrating Internet-facing Microsoft Exchange servers to deploy web shells used for command execution," researchers from SentinelOne and QGroup said in a  new technical report  shared with The Hacker News. "Once a foothold is established, the attackers conduct a variety of reconnaissance, credential theft, lateral movement, and data exfiltration activities." Operation Soft Cell, according to  Cybereason , refers to malicious activities undertaken by China-affiliated actors targeting telecommunications providers since at least 2012. The Soft Cell threat actor, also tracked by Microsoft as  Gallium , is known to target unpatched int

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
German and South Korean government agencies have warned about cyber attacks mounted by a threat actor tracked as  Kimsuky  using rogue browser extensions to steal users' Gmail inboxes. The  joint advisory   comes  from Germany's domestic intelligence apparatus, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), and South Korea's National Intelligence Service of the Republic of Korea (NIS). The intrusions are designed to strike "experts on the Korean Peninsula and North Korea issues" through spear-phishing campaigns, the agencies noted. Kimsuky , also known Black Banshee, Thallium, and Velvet Chollima, refers to a  subordinate element  within North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau and is known to "collect strategic intelligence on geopolitical events and negotiations affecting the DPRK's interests."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has released eight Industrial Control Systems (ICS)  advisories  on Tuesday, warning of critical flaws affecting equipment from Delta Electronics and Rockwell Automation. This includes 13 security vulnerabilities in Delta Electronics' InfraSuite Device Master, a real-time device monitoring software. All versions prior to 1.0.5 are affected by the issues. "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to obtain access to files and credentials, escalate privileges, and remotely execute arbitrary code," CISA  said . Top of the list is  CVE-2023-1133  (CVSS score: 9.8), a critical flaw that arises from the fact that InfraSuite Device Master accepts unverified UDP packets and  deserializes the content , thereby allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. Two other deserialization flaws,  CVE-2023-1139  (CVSS score: 8.8) and  CVE-2023-1145

The North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) actor dubbed ScarCruft is using weaponized Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) files to download additional malware. According to multiple reports from  AhnLab Security Emergency response Center  ( ASEC ),  SEKOIA.IO , and  Zscaler , the development is illustrative of the group's continuous efforts to refine and retool its tactics to sidestep detection. "The group is constantly evolving its tools, techniques, and procedures while experimenting with new file formats and methods to bypass security vendors," Zscaler researchers Sudeep Singh and Naveen Selvan said in a new analysis published Tuesday.  ScarCruft, also tracked under the names APT37, Reaper, RedEyes, and Ricochet Chollima, has exhibited an increased operational tempo since the start of the year, targeting various South Korean entities for espionage purposes.

Active Directory (AD) is a powerful authentication and directory service used by organizations worldwide. With this ubiquity and power comes the potential for abuse. Insider threats offer some of the most potentials for destruction. Many internal users have over-provisioned access and visibility into the internal network. Insiders' level of access and trust in a network leads to unique vulnerabilities. Network security often focuses on keeping a threat actor out, not on existing users' security and potential vulnerabilities. Staying on top of potential threats means protecting against inside and outside threats. Active Directory Vulnerabilities From the outside, a properly configured AD domain offers a secure authentication and authorization solution. But with complex social engineering and phishing email attacks, an existing AD user can become compromised. Once inside, threat actors have many options to attack Active Directory.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The  NuGet  repository is the target of a new "sophisticated and highly-malicious attack" aiming to infect .NET developer systems with cryptocurrency stealer malware. The 13 rogue packages, which were downloaded more than 160,000 times over the past month, have since been taken down. "The packages contained a PowerShell script that would execute upon installation and trigger a download of a 'second stage' payload, which could be remotely executed," JFrog researchers Natan Nehorai and Brian Moussalli  said . While NuGet packages have been in the past found to  contain vulnerabilities  and be abused to  propagate phishing links , the development marks the first-ever discovery of packages with malicious code. Three of the most downloaded packages – Coinbase.Core, Anarchy.Wrapper.Net, and DiscordRichPresence.API – alone accounted for 166,000 downloads, although it's also possible that the threat actors artificially inflated the download counts using bo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat group tracked as  REF2924  has been observed deploying previously unseen malware in its attacks aimed at entities in South and Southeast Asia. The malware, dubbed  NAPLISTENER  by Elastic Security Labs, is an HTTP listener programmed in C# and is designed to evade "network-based forms of detection." REF2924  is the moniker assigned to an activity cluster linked to attacks against an entity in Afghanistan as well as the Foreign Affairs Office of an ASEAN member in 2022. The threat actor's modus operandi suggests overlaps with another hacking group dubbed  ChamelGang , which was documented by Russian cybersecurity company Positive Technologies in October 2021. Attacks orchestrated by the group are said to have exploited internet-exposed Microsoft Exchange servers to  deploy backdoors  such as DOORME, SIESTAGRAPH, and ShadowPad. DOORME, an Internet Information Services ( IIS ) backdoor module, provides remote access to a contested network and executes addit

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In a sudden turn of events, Baphomet, the current administrator of BreachForums, said in an update on March 21, 2023, that the hacking forum has been officially taken down but emphasized that "it's not the end." "You are allowed to hate me, and disagree with my decision but I promise what is to come will be better for us all," Baphomet noted in a message posted on the BreachForums Telegram channel. The  shutdown  is suspected to have been prompted by suspicions that law enforcement may have obtained access to the site's configurations, source code, and information about the forum's users. The development follows the  arrest of its administrator  Conor Brian Fitzpatrick (aka "pompompurin"), who has been charged with a single count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud. Over the past few months, BreachForums filled the void left by RaidForums last year, becoming a lucrative destination to purchase and sell stolen databases from variou

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Amid the  ongoing war  between Russia and Ukraine, government, agriculture, and transportation organizations located in Donetsk, Lugansk, and Crimea have been attacked as part of an active campaign that drops a previously unseen, modular framework dubbed  CommonMagic . "Although the initial vector of compromise is unclear, the details of the next stage imply the use of spear phishing or similar methods," Kaspersky  said  in a new report. The Russian cybersecurity company, which detected the attacks in October 2022, is tracking the activity cluster under the name "Bad Magic." Attack chains entail the use of booby-trapped URLS pointing to a ZIP archive hosted on a malicious web server. The file, when opened, contains a decoy document and a malicious LNK file that culminates in the deployment of a backdoor named PowerMagic. Written in PowerShell, PowerMagic establishes contact with a remote server and executes arbitrary commands, the results of which are exfiltra

Poorly managed Linux SSH servers are being targeted as part of a new campaign that deploys different variants of a malware called ShellBot. "ShellBot, also known as  PerlBot , is a DDoS Bot malware developed in Perl and characteristically uses IRC protocol to communicate with the C&C server," AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC)  said  in a report. ShellBot is installed on servers that have weak credentials, but only after threat actors make use of scanner malware to identify systems that have SSH port 22 open. A list of known SSH credentials is used to initiate a dictionary attack to breach the server and deploy the payload, after which it leverages the Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) protocol to communicate with a remote server. This encompasses the ability to receive commands that allows ShellBot to carry out DDoS attacks and exfiltrate harvested information. ASEC said it identified three different ShellBot versions – LiGhT's Modded perlbot v2, DDoS

H0lyGh0st, Magecart, and a slew of state-sponsored hacker groups are diversifying their tactics and shifting their focus to… You. That is, if you're in charge of cybersecurity for a small-to-midsize enterprise (SME). Why? Bad actors know that SMEs typically have a smaller security budget, less infosec manpower, and possibly weak or missing security controls to protect their data and infrastructure. So, how can you prepare for the imminent onslaught from new and emerging threat groups?  You need a plan. Start with the NIST Cyber Security Framework The good news is you don't have to create your security strategy from scratch. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework (NIST CSF) is one of the most respected and widely used standards in the world. While originally designed for critical infrastructure industries, the NIST CSF is flexible enough for organizations of all sizes, sectors, and maturities to use in large part because the framewor

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as 55 zero-day vulnerabilities were exploited in the wild in 2022, with most of the flaws discovered in software from Microsoft, Google, and Apple. While this figure represents a decrease from the year before, when a staggering 81 zero-days were weaponized, it still represents a significant uptick in recent years of threat actors leveraging unknown security flaws to their advantage. The  findings  come from threat intelligence firm Mandiant, which noted that desktop operating systems (19), web browsers (11), IT and network management products (10), and mobile operating systems (six) accounted for the most exploited product types. Of the 55 zero-day bugs, 13 are estimated to have been abused by cyber espionage groups, with four others exploited by financially motivated threat actors for ransomware-related operations. Commercial spyware vendors were linked to the exploitation of three zero-days. Among state-sponsored groups, those attributed to China have emerged as the most

New DotRunpeX Malware Delivers Multiple Malware Families via Malicious Ads<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/new-dotrunpex-malware-delivers-multiple.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new piece of malware dubbed  dotRunpeX  is being used to distribute numerous known malware families such as  Agent Tesla ,  Ave Maria ,  BitRAT ,  FormBook ,  LokiBot ,  NetWire ,  Raccoon Stealer ,  RedLine Stealer ,  Remcos ,  Rhadamanthys , and  Vidar . "DotRunpeX is a new injector written in .NET using the Process Hollowing technique and used to infect systems with a variety of known malware families," Check Point  said  in a report published last week. Said to be in active development, dotRunpeX arrives as a second-stage malware in the infection chain, often deployed via a downloader (aka loader) that's transmitted through phishing emails as malicious attachments. Alternatively, it's known to leverage malicious Google Ads on search result pages to direct unsuspecting users searching for popular software such as AnyDesk and LastPass to copycat sites hosting trojanized installers. The latest DotRunpeX artifacts, first spotted in October 2022, add an extra o

Mispadu Banking Trojan Targets Latin America: 90,000+ Credentials Stolen<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/mispadu-banking-trojan-targets-latin.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A banking trojan dubbed  Mispadu  has been linked to multiple spam campaigns targeting countries like Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Portugal with the goal of stealing credentials and delivering other payloads. The activity, which commenced in August 2022, is currently ongoing, Ocelot Team from Latin American cybersecurity firm Metabase Q said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Mispadu  (aka URSA) was  first documented  by ESET in November 2019, describing its ability to perpetrate monetary and credential theft and act as a backdoor by taking screenshots and capturing keystrokes. "One of their main strategies is to compromise legitimate websites, searching for vulnerable versions of WordPress, to turn them into their command-and-control server to spread malware from there, filtering out countries they do not wish to infect, dropping different type of malware based on the country being infected," researchers Fernando García and Dan Regalado said.

2022 was the year when inflation hit world economies, except in one corner of the global marketplace – stolen data. Ransomware payments fell by over 40% in 2022 compared to 2021. More organisations chose not to pay ransom demands, according to findings by blockchain firm Chainalysis. Nonetheless, stolen data has value beyond a price tag, and in risky ways you may not expect. Evaluating stolen records is what  Lab 1, a new cyber monitoring platform , believes will make a big difference for long-term cybersecurity resilience. Think of data value this way:  Stolen credentials can become future phishing attacks Logins for adult websites are potential extortion attempts Travel and location data are a risk to VIPs and senior leadership, And so on… Hackers could retaliate for non-payment by simply posting their loot to forums where the data will be available for further enrichment and exploitation.  Shining a light on dark places Even though your company may not have suffered a di

Researchers Shed Light on CatB Ransomware's Evasion Techniques<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/researchers-shed-light-on-catb.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind the CatB ransomware operation have been observed using a technique called  DLL search order hijacking  to evade detection and launch the payload. CatB, also referred to as CatB99 and Baxtoy, emerged late last year and is said to be an "evolution or direct rebrand" of another ransomware strain known as Pandora based on code-level similarities. It's worth noting that the use of Pandora has been attributed to  Bronze Starlight  (aka DEV-0401 or Emperor Dragonfly), a China-based threat actor that's known to employ  short-lived ransomware families  as a ruse to likely conceal its true objectives.  One of the key defining characteristics of CatB is its reliance on DLL hijacking via a legitimate service called Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator ( MSDTC ) to extract and launch the ransomware payload. "Upon execution, CatB payloads rely on DLL search order hijacking to drop and load the malicious payload," SentinelOne researc

Emotet Rises Again: Evades Macro Security via OneNote Attachments<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/emotet-rises-again-evades-macro.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious Emotet malware, in its  return after a short hiatus , is now being distributed via  Microsoft OneNote email attachments  in an attempt to bypass macro-based security restrictions and compromise systems. Emotet , linked to a threat actor tracked as Gold Crestwood, Mummy Spider, or TA542, continues to be a potent and resilient threat despite attempts by law enforcement to take it down. A  derivative  of the  Cridex   banking worm  – which was  subsequently   replaced  by  Dridex  around the same time GameOver Zeus was disrupted in 2014 – Emotet has  evolved  into a "monetized platform for other threat actors to run malicious campaigns on a pay-per-install (PPI) model, allowing theft of sensitive data and ransom extortion." While Emotet infections have acted as a  conduit  to deliver Cobalt Strike, IcedID, Qakbot, Quantum ransomware, and TrickBot, its return in late 2021 was  facilitated  by means of TrickBot.

The zero-day exploitation of a now-patched medium-severity security flaw in the Fortinet  FortiOS  operating system has been linked to a suspected Chinese hacking group.

"UNC3886 is an advanced cyber espionage group with unique capabilities in how they operate on-network as well as the tools they utilize in their campaigns," Mandiant researchers  said  in a technical analysis.

U.S. law enforcement authorities have arrested a New York man in connection with running the infamous BreachForums hacking forum under the online alias " Pompompurin ." The development, first reported by  Bloomberg Law , comes after News 12 Westchester, earlier this week, said that federal investigators "spent hours inside and outside of a home in Peekskill." "At one point, investigators were seen removing several bags of evidence from the house," the New York-based local news service  added . According  to an  affidavit  filed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the suspect identified himself as Conor Brian Fitzpatrick and that he admitted to being the owner of the BreachForums website. "When I arrested the defendant on March 15, 2023, he stated to me in substance and in part that: a) his name was Conor Brian Fitzpatrick; b) he used the alias 'pompompurin,' and c) he was the owner and administrator of 'BreachForums,'&

U.S. government agencies have released a joint cybersecurity advisory detailing the indicators of compromise (IoCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the notorious  LockBit 3.0 ransomware . "The LockBit 3.0 ransomware operations function as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model and is a continuation of previous versions of the ransomware, LockBit 2.0, and LockBit," the authorities  said . The alert comes courtesy of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). Since emerging in late 2019, the  LockBit actors  have invested significant  technical efforts  to develop and fine-tune its malware, issuing two major updates — LockBit 2.0, released in mid-2021, and  LockBit 3.0 , released in June 2022. The two versions are also known as LockBit Red and LockBit Black, respectively. "LockBit 3.0 accepts addition

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Android voice phishing (aka vishing) malware campaign known as FakeCalls has reared its head once again to target South Korean users under the guise of over 20 popular financial apps. "FakeCalls malware possesses the functionality of a Swiss army knife, able not only to conduct its primary aim but also to extract private data from the victim's device," cybersecurity firm Check Point said . FakeCalls was previously documented by Kaspersky in April 2022, describing the malware's capabilities to imitate phone conversations with a bank customer support agent. In the observed attacks, users who install the rogue banking app are enticed into calling the financial institution by offering a fake low-interest loan. At the point where the phone call actually happens, a pre-recorded audio with instructions from the real bank is played. Simultaneously, the malware conceals the phone number with the bank's legitimate number to give the impression that a conversation

Think of the typical portrayal of a cyberattack. Bad guy pounding furiously on a keyboard, his eyes peeking out from under a dark hoodie. At long last, his efforts pay off and he hits the right combination of keys. "I'm in!" he shouts in triumph. Clearly, there are many problems with this scenario – and it's not just the hoodie. What's even more inaccurate is that most cyber attackers today do not rely on unsophisticated methods like brute force. Instead, they target users directly through social engineering, spearphishing and business email compromise (BEC). In light of this, it can be said that cybercriminals no longer break into corporate systems; instead, they log in with valid user credentials. In this landscape of highly targeted cyberattacks, the identity perimeter has emerged as a crucial battlefield. Unfortunately, too many businesses continue to rely on outdated security strategies and tools that leave their users and sensitive systems unprotected. S

A new Golang-based botnet dubbed  HinataBot  has been observed to leverage known flaws to compromise routers and servers and use them to stage distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. "The malware binaries appear to have been named by the malware author after a character from the popular anime series, Naruto, with file name structures such as 'Hinata-<OS>-<Architecture>,'" Akamai  said  in a technical report. Among the methods used to distribute the malware are the exploitation of exposed Hadoop YARN servers and security flaws in Realtek SDK devices ( CVE-2014-8361 )and Huawei HG532 routers ( CVE-2017-17215 , CVSS score: 8.8). Unpatched vulnerabilities and weak credentials have been a low-hanging fruit for attackers, representing an easy, well-documented entry point that does not require sophisticated social engineering tactics or other methods.

In the modern corporate IT environment, which relies on cloud connectivity, global connections and large volumes of data, the browser is now the most important work interface. The browser connects employees to managed resources, devices to the web, and the on-prem environment to the cloud one. Yet, and probably unsurprisingly, this browser prominence has significantly increased the number of threats that adversaries target the browser with. Attackers are now leveraging the browser's core functionality - rendering and executing web pages for users to access - to perform attacks. The browser is now an attack surface, as well as an attack vector for malicious access to corporate SaaS and web applications through account takeover and the use of compromised credentials. To address this issue, a new guide was recently published ( Download Here ). It analyzes what a solution to these threats would look like.

While the first instance of clipper malware on the Google Play Store dates back to 2019, the development marks the first time Android-based clipper malware has been built into instant messaging apps. "Moreover, some of these apps use optical character recognition (OCR) to recognize text from screenshots stored on the compromised devices, which is another first for Android malware," the Slovak cybersecurity firm added.

The advanced persistent threat known as  Winter Vivern  has been linked to campaigns targeting government officials in India, Lithuania, Slovakia, and the Vatican since 2021.

Google is calling attention to a set of severe security flaws in Samsung's Exynos chips, some of which could be exploited remotely to completely compromise a phone without requiring any user interaction. The 18 zero-day vulnerabilities affect a wide range of Android smartphones from Samsung, Vivo, Google, wearables using the Exynos W920 chipset, and vehicles equipped with the Exynos Auto T5123 chipset. Four of the 18 flaws make it possible for a threat actor to achieve internet-to-Samsung, Vivo, and Google, as well as wearables using the Exynos W920 chipset and vehicleses in late 2022 and early 2023, said. "[The] four vulnerabilities allow an attacker to remotely compromise a phone at the baseband level with no user interaction, and require only that the attacker know the victim's phone number," Tim Willis, head of Google Project Zero,  said .

Chinese and Russian Hackers Using SILKLOADER Malware to Evade Detection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/chinese-and-russian-hackers-using.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat activity clusters affiliated with the Chinese and Russian cybercriminal ecosystems have been observed using a new piece of malware that's designed to load Cobalt Strike onto infected machines. Dubbed  SILKLOADER  by Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure, the malware leverages  DLL side-loading techniques  to deliver commercial adversary simulation software. The development comes as  improved detection capabilities  against Cobalt Strike, a legitimate post-exploitation tool used for red team operations, is forcing threat actors to  seek alternative options  or concoct new ways to propagate the framework to evade detection. "The most common of these include adding complexity to the auto-generated beacon or stager payloads via the utilization of packers, crypters, loaders, or similar techniques," WithSecure researchers  said . SILKLOADER joins other loaders such as KoboldLoader, MagnetLoader, and LithiumLoader that have been  recently discovered  incorporating

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The cryptojacking group known as  TeamTNT  is suspected to be behind a previously undiscovered strain of malware used to mine Monero cryptocurrency on compromised systems. That's according to Cado Security, which  found  the  sample  after Sysdig detailed a sophisticated attack known as  SCARLETEEL  aimed at containerized environments to ultimately steal proprietary data and software. Specifically, the early phase of the attack chain involved the use of a cryptocurrency miner, which the cloud security firm suspected was deployed as a decoy to conceal the detection of data exfiltration. The artifact – uploaded to VirusTotal late last month – "bear[s] several syntactic and semantic similarities to prior TeamTNT payloads, and includes a wallet ID that has previously been attributed to them," a new analysis from Cado Security has  revealed . TeamTNT , active since at least 2019, has been documented to repeatedly strike cloud and container environments to deploy cryptocur

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coalition of law enforcement agencies across Europe and the U.S.  announced  the takedown of ChipMixer, an unlicensed cryptocurrency mixer that began its operations in August 2017. "The ChipMixer software blocked the blockchain trail of the funds, making it attractive for cybercriminals looking to launder illegal proceeds from criminal activities such as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, ransomware attacks, and payment card fraud," Europol  said  in a statement. The coordinated exercise, besides dismantling the clearnet and dark web websites associated with ChipMixer, also resulted in the seizure of $47.5 million in Bitcoin and 7 TB of data. Mixers, also called tumblers,  offer full anonymity  for a fee by commingling cryptocurrency from different users – both legitimate and criminally-derived funds – in a manner that makes it hard to trace the origins. This is achieved by funneling different payments into a single pool before splitting up each amount and transmit

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In last year's edition of the  Security Navigator  we noted that the Manufacturing Industry appeared to be totally over-represented in our dataset of Cyber Extortion victims. Neither the number of businesses nor their average revenue particularly stood out to explain this. Manufacturing was also the most represented Industry in our CyberSOC dataset – contributing more Incidents than any other sector.  We found this trend confirmed in 2023 – so much in fact that we decided to take a closer look. So let's examine some possible explanations.  And debunk them. Hunting for possible explanations Manufacturing is still the most impacted industry in our Cyber Extortion dataset in 2023, as tracked by monitoring double-extortion leak sites. Indeed, this sector now represents more than 20% of all victims since we started observing the leak sites in the beginning of 2020. Approximately 28% of all our clients are from Manufacturing, contributing with an overall share of 31% of all p

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on March 15  added  a security vulnerability impacting Adobe ColdFusion to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. The critical flaw in question is  CVE-2023-26360  (CVSS score: 8.6), which could be exploited by a threat actor to achieve arbitrary code execution. "Adobe ColdFusion contains an improper access control vulnerability that allows for remote code execution," CISA  said . The vulnerability impacts ColdFusion 2018 (Update 15 and earlier versions) and ColdFusion 2021 (Update 5 and earlier versions). It has been addressed in versions Update 16 and Update 6, respectively, released on March 14, 2023. It's worth noting that CVE-2023-26360 also affects ColdFusion 2016 and ColdFusion 11 installations, both of which are no longer supported by the software company as they have  reached  end-of-life (EoL).

A previously undocumented threat actor dubbed  YoroTrooper  has been targeting government, energy, and international organizations across Europe as part of a cyber espionage campaign that has been active since at least June 2022. "Information stolen from successful compromises include credentials from multiple applications, browser histories and cookies, system information and screenshots," Cisco Talos researchers Asheer Malhotra and Vitor Ventura  said  in a Tuesday analysis. Prominent countries targeted include Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations. The threat actor is believed to be Russian-speaking owing to the victimology patterns and the presence of Cyrillic snippets in some of the implants. That said, the YoroTrooper intrusion set has been found to exhibit tactical overlaps with the  PoetRAT team  that was  documented  in 2020 as leveraging coronavirus-themed baits to strike government and ene

New Cryptojacking Operation Targeting Kubernetes Clusters for Dero Mining<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/new-cryptojacking-operation-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered the first-ever illicit cryptocurrency mining campaign used to mint Dero since the start of February 2023. "The novel Dero cryptojacking operation concentrates on locating Kubernetes clusters with anonymous access enabled on a Kubernetes API and listening on non-standard ports accessible from the internet," CrowdStrike  said  in a new report shared with The Hacker News. The development marks a notable shift from Monero, which is a prevalent cryptocurrency used in such campaigns. It's suspected it may have to do with the fact that  Dero  "offers larger rewards and provides the same or better anonymizing features." The attacks, attributed to an unknown financially motivated actor, commence with scanning for Kubernetes clusters with authentication set as  --anonymous-auth=true , which allows anonymous requests to the server, to drop initial payloads from three different U.S.-based IP addresses.

The stakes could not be higher for cyber defenders. With the vast amounts of sensitive information, intellectual property, and financial data at risk, the consequences of a data breach can be devastating. According to a report released by  Ponemon institute , the cost of data breaches has reached an all-time high, averaging $4.35 million in 2022. Vulnerabilities in web applications are often the primary gateway for attackers. According to  a World Economic Forum report , just one week after discovering a critical security flaw in a widely used software library (Log4j), more than 100 attempts at exploiting the vulnerability were detected every minute. This illustrates how quickly malicious actors can take advantage of vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgency of regularly assessing and monitoring your system for any vulnerabilities or weak points. The complexity of addressing security challenges in today's digital world is further compounded by the rising use of open-source compo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A cyberespionage actor known as Tick has been attributed with high confidence to a compromise of an East Asian data-loss prevention (DLP) company that caters to government and military entities. "The attackers compromised the DLP company's internal update servers to deliver malware inside the software developer's network, and trojanized installers of legitimate tools used by the company, which eventually resulted in the execution of malware on the computers of the company's customers," ESET researcher Facundo Muñoz  said . Tick , also known as Bronze Butler, REDBALDKNIGHT , Stalker Panda, and Stalker Taurus, is a suspected China-aligned collective that has primarily gone after government, manufacturing, and biotechnology firms in Japan. It's said to be active  since at least 2006 . Other lesser-known targets include Russian, Singaporean, and Chinese enterprises.

Microsoft's Patch Tuesday update for March 2023 is rolling out with remediations for a set of  80 security flaws , two of which have come under active exploitation in the wild. Eight of the 80 bugs are rated Critical, 71 are rated Important, and one is rated Moderate in severity. The updates are in  addition to 29 flaws  the tech giant fixed in its Chromium-based Edge browser in recent weeks. The two vulnerabilities that have come under active attack include a Microsoft Outlook privilege escalation flaw ( CVE-2023-23397 , CVSS score: 9.8) and a Windows SmartScreen security feature bypass ( CVE-2023-24880 , CVSS score: 5.1). CVE-2023-23397 is "triggered when an attacker sends a message with an extended MAPI property with a UNC path to an SMB (TCP 445) share on a threat actor-controlled server," Microsoft  said  in a standalone advisory. A threat actor could leverage this flaw by sending a specially crafted email, activating it automatically when it is retrieved and pr

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Golang-based malware dubbed  GoBruteforcer  has been found targeting web servers running phpMyAdmin, MySQL, FTP, and Postgres to corral the devices into a botnet. "GoBruteforcer chose a Classless Inter-Domain Routing ( CIDR ) block for scanning the network during the attack, and it targeted all IP addresses within that CIDR range," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers  said . "The threat actor chose CIDR block scanning as a way to get access to a wide range of target hosts on different IPs within a network instead of using a single IP address as a target." The malware is mainly designed to single out Unix-like platforms running x86, x64 and ARM architectures, with GoBruteforcer attempting to obtain access via a brute-force attack using a list of credentials hard-coded into the binary. If the attack proves to be successful, an internet relay chat ( IRC ) bot is deployed on the victim server to establish communications with an actor-controlled server.

Today, the LockBit ransomware is the most active and successful cybercrime organization in the world. Attributed to a Russian Threat Actor, LockBit has stepped out from the shadows of the Conti ransomware group, who were disbanded in early 2022. LockBit ransomware was first discovered in September 2019 and was previously known as ABCD ransomware because of the ".abcd virus" extension first observed. LockBit operates as a Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model. In short, this means that affiliates make a deposit to use the tool, then split the ransom payment with the LockBit group. It has been reported that some affiliates are receiving a share as high of 75%. LockBit's operators have posted advertisements for their affiliate program on Russian-language criminal forums stating they will not operate in Russia or any CIS countries, nor will they work with English-speaking developers unless a Russian-speaking "guarantor" vouches for them.  Initial attack vectors of

An open source adversary-in-the-middle ( AiTM ) phishing kit has found a number of takers in the cybercrime world for its ability to orchestrate attacks at scale. Microsoft Threat Intelligence is tracking the threat actor behind the development of the kit under its emerging moniker  DEV-1101 . An  AiTM phishing attack  typically involves a threat actor attempting to steal and intercept a target's password and session cookies by deploying a proxy server between the user and the website. Such attacks are more effective owing to their ability to circumvent multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections. DEV-1101, per the tech giant, is said to be the party behind several phishing kits that can be purchased or rented by other criminal actors, thereby reducing the effort and resources required to launch a phishing campaign. "The availability of such phishing kits for purchase by attackers is part of the industrialization of the cybercriminal economy and lowers the barrier of

Fortinet FortiOS Flaw Exploited in Targeted Cyberattacks on Government Entities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/fortinet-fortios-flaw-exploited-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government entities and large organizations have been targeted by an unknown threat actor by exploiting a security flaw in Fortinet FortiOS software to result in data loss and OS and file corruption. "The complexity of the exploit suggests an advanced actor and that it is highly targeted at governmental or government-related targets," Fortinet researchers Guillaume Lovet and Alex Kong said in an advisory last week. The zero-day flaw in question is CVE-2022-41328 (CVSS score: 6.5), a medium security path traversal bug in FortiOS that could lead to arbitrary code execution. "An improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory vulnerability ('path traversal') [CWE-22] in FortiOS may allow a privileged attacker to read and write arbitrary files via crafted CLI commands," the company noted. The shortcoming impacts FortiOS versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.4.0 through 6.4.11, 7.0.0 through 7.0.9, and 7.2.0 through 7.2.3. Fixes are available in versions 6.4.1

Large-scale Cyber Attack Hijacks East Asian Websites for Adult Content Redirects<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/large-scale-cyber-attack-hijacks-east.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A widespread malicious cyber operation has hijacked thousands of websites aimed at East Asian audiences to redirect visitors to adult-themed content since early September 2022. The ongoing campaign entails injecting malicious JavaScript code to the hacked websites, often connecting to the target web server using legitimate FTP credentials the threat actor previously obtained via an unknown method. "In many cases, these were highly secure auto-generated FTP credentials which the attacker was somehow able to acquire and leverage for website hijacking," Wiz  said  in a report published this month. The fact that the breached websites – owned by both small firms and multinational corporations – utilize different tech stacks and hosting service providers has made it difficult to trace a common attack vector, the cloud security company noted. That having said, one of the common denominators between the websites is that a majority of them are either hosted in China or hosted in

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A fake ChatGPT-branded Chrome browser extension has been found to come with capabilities to hijack Facebook accounts and create rogue admin accounts, highlighting one of the different methods cyber criminals are using to distribute malware. "By hijacking high-profile Facebook business accounts, the threat actor creates an elite army of Facebook bots and a malicious paid media apparatus," Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal  said  in a technical report. "This allows it to push Facebook paid ads at the expense of its victims in a self-propagating worm-like manner." The "Quick access to Chat GPT" extension, which is said to have attracted 2,000 installations per day since March 3, 2023, has since been pulled by Google from the Chrome Web Store as of March 9, 2023. The browser add-on is promoted through Facebook-sponsored posts, and while it offers the ability to connect to the ChatGPT service, it's also engineered to surreptitiously harvest cookies and

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is one of the standard-bearers in global cybersecurity. The U.S.-based institute's cybersecurity framework helps organizations of all sizes understand, manage, and reduce their cyber-risk levels and better protect their data. Its importance in the fight against cyberattacks can't be overstated. While NIST hasn't directly developed standards related to securing the SaaS ecosystem, they are instrumental in the way we approach SaaS security. NIST recently released its  Guide to a Secure Enterprise Network Landscape . In it, they discuss the transformation from on-premise networks to multiple cloud servers. Access to these servers, and the accompanying SaaS apps, is through both secure and unsecured devices and locations across disparate geography. The move to the cloud has effectively obliterated the network perimeter. As a result, companies have increased their attack surface and are experiencing an escalation of attacks that

Threat actors have been increasingly observed using AI-generated YouTube Videos to spread a variety of stealer malware such as Raccoon, RedLine, and Vidar. "The videos lure users by pretending to be tutorials on how to download cracked versions of software such as Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Autodesk 3ds Max, AutoCAD, and other products that are licensed products available only to paid users," CloudSEK researcher Pavan Karthick M  said . Just as the ransomware landscape comprises core developers and affiliates who are in charge of identifying potential targets and actually carrying out the attacks, the information stealer ecosystem also consists of threat actors known as  traffers  who are recruited to spread the malware using different methods. One of the popular malware distribution channels is YouTube, with CloudSEK witnessing a 200-300% month-over-month increase in videos containing links to stealer malware in the description section.

More than a dozen security flaws have been disclosed in E11, a smart intercom product made by Chinese company Akuvox .

Akuvox E11 is described by the company on its website as a " SIP  [Session Initiation Protocol] video doorphone specially designed for villas, houses, and apartments." The  product listing , however, has been taken down from the website, displaying an error message: "Page does not exist." A  snapshot  captured by Google shows that the page was live as recently as March 12, 2023, 05:59:51 GMT.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The  Dark Pink  advanced persistent threat (APT) actor has been linked to a fresh set of attacks targeting government and military entities in Southeast Asian countries with a malware called KamiKakaBot. Dark Pink, also called Saaiwc, was extensively profiled by Group-IB earlier this year, describing its use of custom tools such as TelePowerBot and KamiKakaBot to run arbitrary commands and exfiltrate sensitive information. The threat actor is suspected to be of Asia-Pacific origin and has been active since at least mid-2021, with an increased tempo observed in 2022. "The latest attacks, which took place in February 2023, were almost identical to previous attacks," Dutch cybersecurity company EclecticIQ  disclosed  in a new report published last week. "The main difference in the February campaign is that the malware's obfuscation routine has improved to better evade anti-malware measures." The attacks play out in the form of social engineering lures that

BATLOADER Malware Uses Google Ads to Deliver Vidar Stealer and Ursnif Payloads<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/batloader-malware-uses-google-ads-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The malware downloader known as BATLOADER has been observed  abusing Google Ads  to deliver secondary payloads like Vidar Stealer and Ursnif. According to cybersecurity company  eSentire , malicious ads are used to spoof a wide range of legitimate apps and services such as Adobe, OpenAPI's ChatGPT, Spotify, Tableau, and Zoom. BATLOADER , as the name suggests, is a loader that's responsible for distributing next-stage malware such as information stealers, banking malware, Cobalt Strike, and even ransomware. One of the key traits of the BATLOADER operations is the use of software impersonation tactics for malware delivery. This is achieved by setting up lookalike websites that host Windows installer files masquerading as legitimate apps to trigger the infection sequence when a user searching for the software clicks a rogue ad on the Google search results page. These MSI installer files, when launched, execute Python scripts that contain the BATLOADER payload to retrieve t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An updated version of a botnet malware called  Prometei  has infected more than 10,000 systems worldwide since November 2022. The infections are both geographically indiscriminate and opportunistic, with a majority of the victims reported in Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey. Prometei, first observed in 2016, is a modular botnet that features a large repertoire of components and several proliferation methods, some of which also include the  exploitation  of ProxyLogon Microsoft Exchange Server flaws. It's also notable for avoiding striking Russia, suggesting that the threat actors behind the operation are likely based in the country. The cross-platform botnet's motivations are financial, primarily leveraging its pool of infected hosts to mine cryptocurrency and harvest credentials. The latest variant of Prometei (called v3) improves upon its existing features to challenge forensic analysis and further burrow its access on victim machines, Cisco Talos  said  in a report share

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspecting China-linked hacking campaign has been observed targeting unpatched SonicWall  Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 appliances  to drop malware and establish long-term persistence. "The malware has functionality to steal user credentials, provide shell access, and persist through firmware upgrades," cybersecurity company Mandiant  said  in a technical report published this week. The Google-owned incident response and threat intelligence firm is tracking the activity under its uncategorized moniker  UNC4540 . The malware – a collection of bash scripts and a single ELF binary identified as a TinyShell backdoor – is engineered to grant the attacker privileged access to SonicWall devices. The overall objective behind the custom toolset appears to be credential theft, with the malware permitting the adversary to siphon cryptographically hashed credentials from all logged-in users. It further provides shell access to the compromised device. Mandiant also called out th

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coordinated international law enforcement exercise has taken down the online infrastructure associated with a cross-platform remote access trojan (RAT) known as NetWire . Coinciding with the seizure of the sales website www.worldwiredlabs[.]com, a Croatian national who is suspected to be the website's administrator has been arrested. While the suspect's name was not released, investigative journalist Brian Krebs  identified  Mario Zanko as the owner of the domain. "NetWire is a licensed commodity RAT offered in underground forums to non-technical users to carry out their own criminal activities," Europol's European Cybercrime Center (EC3)  said  in a tweet. Advertised  since   at least 2012 , the malware is typically distributed via  malspam campaigns  and gives a remote attacker complete control over a Windows, macOS, or Linux system. It also comes with password-stealing and keylogging capabilities. The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)  said  an investiga

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) has long ago become a standard security practice. With a wide consensus on its ability to fend off more than 99% percent of account takeover attacks, it's no wonder why security architects regard it as a must-have in their environments. However, what seems to be less known are the inherent coverage limitations of traditional MFA solutions. While compatible with RDP connection and local desktop logins,  they offer no protection to remote command line access tools like PsExec, Remote PowerShell and their likes. In practice, it means that workstations and servers remain as vulnerable to lateral movement, ransomware spread and other identity threats despite having a fully functioning MFA solution on. For the adversary it's just a matter of taking the command line path instead of the RDP to log in as if there was not protection installed at all. In this article we'll explore this blind spot, understand its root cause and implications, and view

Named " Xenomorph 3rd generation " by the Hadoken Security Group, the threat actor behind the operation, the updated version comes with new features that allow it to perform financial fraud in a seamless manner. "This new version of the malware adds many new capabilities to an already feature-rich Android banker, most notably the introduction of a very extensive runtime engine powered by Accessibility services, which is used by actors to implement a complete  ATS framework ," the Dutch security firm  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. Xenomorph  first came to light  a year ago in February 2022, when it was found to target 56 European banks through  dropper apps  published on the Google Play Store. In contrast, the latest iteration of the banker – which has a dedicated website advertising its features – is designed to targe

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A North Korean espionage group tracked as  UNC2970  has been observed employing previously undocumented malware families as part of a spear-phishing campaign targeting U.S. and European media and technology organizations since June 2022. Google-owned Mandiant said the threat cluster shares "multiple overlaps" with a  long-running   operation   dubbed  " Dream Job " that employs job recruitment lures in email messages to trigger the infection sequence. UNC2970 is the new moniker designated by the threat intelligence firm to a set of North Korean cyber activity that maps to UNC577 (aka Temp.Hermit ), and which also comprises another nascent threat cluster tracked as UNC4034. The UNC4034 activity, as  documented  by Mandiant in September 2022, entailed the use of WhatsApp to socially engineer targets into downloading a  backdoor  called AIRDRY.V2 under the pretext of sharing a skills assessment test.

Hackers Exploiting Remote Desktop Software Flaws to Deploy PlugX Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/hackers-exploiting-remote-desktop.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security vulnerabilities in remote desktop programs such as Sunlogin and AweSun are being exploited by threat actors to deploy the PlugX malware. AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC), in a  new analysis , said it marks the continued abuse of the flaws to deliver a variety of payloads on compromised systems. This  includes  the Sliver post-exploitation framework, XMRig cryptocurrency miner, Gh0st RAT, and Paradise ransomware. PlugX is the latest addition to this list. The  modular malware  has been extensively put to use by threat actors based in China, with new features continuously added to help perform system control and information theft. In the attacks observed by ASEC, successful exploitation of the flaws is followed by the execution of a PowerShell command that retrieves an executable and a DLL file from a remote server. This executable is a legitimate HTTP Server Service from cybersecurity company ESET, which is used to load the DLL file by means of a techniq

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously known Windows-based ransomware strain known as IceFire has expanded its focus to target Linux enterprise networks belonging to several media and entertainment sector organizations across the world. The intrusions entail the exploitation of a recently disclosed deserialization vulnerability in IBM Aspera Faspex file-sharing software ( CVE-2022-47986 , CVSS score: 9.8), according to cybersecurity company SentinelOne. "This strategic shift is a significant move that aligns them with  other   ransomware  groups that also target Linux systems," Alex Delamotte, senior threat researcher at SentinelOne,  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. A majority of the attacks observed by SentinelOne have been directed against companies located in Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and the U.A.E., countries that are not typically targeted by organized ransomware crews. IceFire  was first detected in March 2022 by the  MalwareHunterTeam , but it wasn't until August 2022 tha

Phishing, the theft of users' credentials or sensitive data using social engineering, has been a significant threat since the early days of the internet – and continues to plague organizations today,  accounting for more than 30% of all known breaches . And with the mass migration to remote working during the pandemic, hackers have ramped up their efforts to steal login credentials as they take advantage of the chaos and lack of in-person user verification.  This has led to the revival of the old-school technique of vishing, which, like phishing online, involves using social engineering over the phone to steal sensitive information. Vishing attacks have  been on the rise  as a result, with 69% of companies experiencing them in 2021, up from 54% in 2020. These attacks often take the form of job or tech support scams and can be incredibly convincing. In August 2020, the  FBI along with the CISA  issued a warning regarding remote users being targeted by attackers spoofing organizati

The infamous cryptocurrency miner group called 8220 Gang has been observed using a new crypter called ScrubCrypt to carry out cryptojacking operations. According to Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, the attack chain commences with successful exploitation of susceptible Oracle WebLogic servers to download a PowerShell script that contains ScrubCrypt. Crypters are a type of software that can encrypt, obfuscate, and manipulate malware with the goal of evading detection by security programs. ScrubCrypt, which is advertised for sale by its author, comes with features to bypass Windows Defender protections as well as check for the presence of debugging and virtual machine environments. "ScrubCrypt is a crypter used to secure applications with a unique BAT packing method," security researcher Cara Lin  said  in a technical report.

Fortinet has released fixes to  address 15 security flaws , including one critical vulnerability impacting FortiOS and FortiProxy that could enable a threat actor to take control of affected systems. The issue, tracked as  CVE-2023-25610 , is rated 9.3 out of 10 for severity and was internally discovered and reported by its security teams. "A buffer underwrite ('buffer underflow') vulnerability in FortiOS and FortiProxy administrative interface may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device and/or perform a DoS on the GUI, via specifically crafted requests," Fortinet  said  in an advisory. Underflow bugs , also called  buffer underruns , occur when the input data is shorter than the reserved space, causing unpredictable behavior or leakage of sensitive data from memory. Other possible consequences include memory corruption that could either be weaponized to induce a crash or execute arbitrary code. Fortinet said it's not

Jenkins Security Alert: New Security Flaws Could Allow Code Execution Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/jenkins-security-alert-new-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A pair of severe security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the Jenkins open source automation server that could lead to code execution on targeted systems. The flaws, tracked as  CVE-2023-27898  and  CVE-2023-27905 , impact the Jenkins server and Update Center, and have been collectively christened  CorePlague  by cloud security firm Aqua. All versions of Jenkins versions prior to 2.319.2 are vulnerable and exploitable. "Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's Jenkins server, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the Jenkins server," the company said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The shortcomings are the result of how Jenkins processes plugins available from the  Update Center , thereby potentially enabling a threat actor to upload a plugin with a malicious payload and trigger a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. "Once the victim opens the ' Available Plug

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As threats grow and attack surfaces get more complex, companies continue to struggle with the multitude of tools they utilize to handle endpoint security and management. This can leave gaps in an enterprise's ability to identify devices that are accessing the network and in ensuring that those devices are compliant with security policies. These gaps are often seen in outdated spreadsheets that are used to track and manage asset inventory, configurations, vulnerabilities, and more. Ultimately, this increases organizational risk while stifling efficiency and productivity. That's why unified security and endpoint management has gained ground, as noted in  Gartner's Hype Cycle for Endpoint Security, 2022 . As part of the market's need to gain a clearer, real-time picture of their devices and security posture, Syxsense launched its Enterprise platform last year to address the three key elements of endpoint management and security: vulnerabilities, patch, and compliance.

Lazarus Group Exploits Zero-Day Vulnerability to Hack South Korean Financial Entity<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/lazarus-group-exploits-zero-day.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korea-linked  Lazarus Group  has been observed weaponizing flaws in an undisclosed software to breach a financial business entity in South Korea twice within a span of a year. While the first attack in May 2022 entailed the use of a vulnerable version of a certificate software that's widely used by public institutions and universities, the re-infiltration in October 2022 involved the exploitation of a zero-day in the same program. Cybersecurity firm AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)  said  it's refraining from mentioning the software owing to the fact that "the vulnerability has not been fully verified yet and a software patch has not been released." The adversarial collective, after obtaining an initial foothold by an unknown method, abused the zero-day bug to perform lateral movement, shortly after which the AhnLab V3 anti-malware engine was disabled via a  BYOVD attack . It's worth noting here that the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Dr

Sharp Panda Using New Soul Framework Version to Target Southeast Asian Governments<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/sharp-panda-using-new-soul-framework.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
High-profile government entities in Southeast Asia are the target of a cyber espionage campaign undertaken by a Chinese threat actor known as Sharp Panda since late last year. The intrusions are characterized by the use of a new version of the Soul modular framework, marking a departure from the group's attack chains observed in 2021. Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point  said  the "long-running" activities have historically singled out countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Sharp Panda was  first documented  by the firm in June 2021, describing it as a "highly-organized operation that placed significant effort into remaining under the radar." Interestingly, the use of the Soul backdoor was  detailed  by Broadcom's Symantec in October 2021 in connection to an unattributed espionage operation targeting defense, healthcare, and ICT sectors in Southeast Asia.

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new information stealer dubbed SYS01stealer targeting critical government infrastructure employees, manufacturing companies, and other sectors. "The threat actors behind the campaign are targeting Facebook business accounts by using Google ads and fake Facebook profiles that promote things like games, adult content, and cracked software, etc. to lure victims into downloading a malicious file," Morphisec said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The attack is designed to steal sensitive information, including login data, cookies, and Facebook ad and business account information." The Israeli cybersecurity company said the campaign was initially tied to a financially motivated cybercriminal operation  dubbed Ducktail  by Zscaler. However, WithSecure, which  first documented  the Ducktail activity cluster in July 2022, said the  two intrusion sets  are different from one another, indicating how the threat actors

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected Pakistan-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as  Transparent Tribe  has been linked to an ongoing cyber espionage campaign targeting Indian and Pakistani Android users with a backdoor called  CapraRAT . "Transparent Tribe distributed the Android CapraRAT backdoor via trojanized secure messaging and calling apps branded as MeetsApp and MeetUp," ESET  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. As many as 150 victims, likely with military or political leanings, are estimated to have been targeted, with the malware ( com.meetup.app ) available to download from fake websites that masquerade as the official distribution centers of these apps. It's being suspected that the targets are lured through a honeytrap romance scam wherein the threat actor approaches the victims via another platform and persuades them to install the malware-laced apps under the pretext of "secure" messaging and calling. However, the apps, besides offering

Investing in digital identity can improve security, increase clinical productivity, and boost healthcare's bottom line.  —  b y Gus Malezis, CEO of Imprivata Digitalization has created immeasurable opportunities for businesses over the past two decades. But the growth of hybrid work and expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) has outpaced traditional 'castle and moat' cybersecurity, introducing unprecedented vulnerabilities, especially in the healthcare industry. Although all organizations have important data to secure, healthcare holds some of the public's most sensitive personal health information (PHI) – not to mention insurance and financial data, as well.  We all expect this information to be secured and protected, especially with HIPAA laws in place. However, due to increasing IT fragmentation and the growing sophistication of cyberattacks, this is no longer guaranteed. In fact, the number of individuals affected by health data breaches in the U.S. since 2009 is

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An older version of Shein's  Android application  suffered from a bug that periodically captured and transmitted clipboard contents to a remote server. The Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team said it  discovered  the problem in  version 7.9.2  of the app that was released on December 16, 2021. The issue has since been addressed as of May 2022. Shein, originally named ZZKKO, is a Chinese online fast fashion retailer based in Singapore. The app, which is currently at version 9.0.0, has over 100 million downloads on the Google Play Store. The tech giant  said  it's not "specifically aware of any malicious intent behind the behavior," but noted that the function isn't necessary to perform tasks on the app. It further pointed out that launching the application after copying any content to the device clipboard automatically triggered an HTTP POST request containing the data to the server "api-service[.]shein[.]com."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The massive breach at LastPass was the result of one of its engineers failing to update Plex on their home computer, in what's a sobering reminder of the dangers of failing to keep software up-to-date. The embattled password management service last week  revealed  how unidentified actors leveraged information stolen from an earlier incident that took place prior to August 12, 2022, along with details "available from a third-party data breach and a vulnerability in a third-party media software package to launch a coordinated second attack" between August and October 2022. The intrusion ultimately enabled the adversary to steal partially encrypted password vault data and customer information. The second attack specifically singled out one of the four DevOps engineers, targeting their home computer with a keylogger malware to obtain the credentials and breach the cloud storage environment. This, in turn, is said to have been made possible by exploiting a nearly three-y

A never-before-seen complex malware is targeting business-grade routers to covertly spy on victims in Latin America, Europe, and North America at least since July 2022. The elusive campaign, dubbed  Hiatus  by Lumen Black Lotus Labs, has been found to deploy two malicious binaries, a remote access trojan dubbed HiatusRAT and a  variant of tcpdump  that makes it possible to capture packet capture on the target device. "Once a targeted system is infected, HiatusRAT allows the threat actor to remotely interact with the system, and it utilizes prebuilt functionality [...] to convert the compromised machine into a covert proxy for the threat actor," the company  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The packet-capture binary enables the actor to monitor router traffic on ports associated with email and file-transfer communications." The threat cluster primarily singles out end-of-life (EoL) DrayTek Vigor router models 2960 and 3900, with approximately 100

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Deep fakes are expected to become a more prominent attack vector. Here's how to identify them. What are Deep Fakes? A deep fake is the act of maliciously replacing real images and videos with fabricated ones to perform information manipulation. To create images, video and audio that are high quality enough to be used in deep fakes, AI and ML are required. Such use of AI, ML and image replacement are unlike other types of information manipulation, which use less extreme manipulation techniques, like misrepresentation of information, isolating parts of the information or editing it in a deceptive manner. Etay Maor, Senior Director of Security Strategy at Cato Networks adds "To add complications, the recent advancements and accessibility to AI generated text, such as GPT3, have already been used in combination with deepfakes (as a proof of concept) to create interactive, human looking conversation bots" What Do Deep Fakes Look Like?

Law enforcement authorities from Germany and Ukraine have targeted suspected core members of a cybercrime group that has been behind large-scale attacks using DoppelPaymer ransomware. The operation, which took place on February 28, 2023, was carried out with support from the Dutch National Police (Politie) and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), according to Europol. This encompassed a raid of a German national's house as well as searches in the Ukrainian cities of Kiev and Kharkiv. A Ukrainian national was also interrogated. Both individuals are believed to have taken up crucial positions in the DoppelPaymer group. "Forensic analysis of the seized equipment is still ongoing to determine the exact role of the suspects and their links to other accomplices," the agency further  said . DoppelPaymer , according to cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, emerged in April 2019 and shares most of its code with another ransomware strain known as BitPaymer, which is attri

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors can take advantage of "insufficient" forensic visibility into Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to exfiltrate sensitive data, a new research has found. "Unfortunately, GCP does not provide the level of visibility in its storage logs that is needed to allow any effective forensic investigation, making organizations blind to potential data exfiltration attacks," cloud incident response firm Mitiga  said  in a report. The attack banks on the prerequisite that the adversary is able to gain control of an identity and access management (IAM) entity in the targeted organization by methods like social engineering to access the GCP environment. The crux of the problem is that GCP's  storage access logs  do not provide adequate transparency with regards to potential file access and read events, instead grouping them all as a single "Object Get" activity.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of researchers has revealed what it says is a vulnerability in a specific implementation of  CRYSTALS-Kyber , one of the encryption algorithms chosen by the U.S. government as quantum-resistant last year. The exploit relates to "side-channel attacks on up to the fifth-order masked implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber in ARM Cortex-M4 CPU," Elena Dubrova, Kalle Ngo, and Joel Gärtner of KTH Royal Institute of Technology  said  in a paper. CRYSTALS-Kyber is one of four post-quantum algorithms  selected  by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) after a rigorous multi-year effort to identify the next-generation encryption standards that can withstand huge leaps in computing power. A side-channel attack, as the name implies, involves extracting secrets from a cryptosystem through measurement and analysis of physical parameters. Some examples of such parameters include supply current, execution time, and electromagnetic emission. The underlying id

This past January, a SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) company named Wing Security (Wing) made waves with the  launch of its free SaaS-Shadow IT discovery solution . Cloud-based companies were invited to gain insight into their employees' SaaS usage through a completely free, self-service product that operates on a "freemium" model. If a user is impressed with the solution and wants to gain more insights or take remediation action, they can purchase the enterprise solution. "In today's economic reality, security budgets have not necessarily been cut down, but buyers are far more careful in their purchasing decisions and rightfully so. We believe that you cannot secure what you do not know, so knowing should be a basic commodity. Once you understand the magnitude of your SaaS attack layer, you can make an educated decision as to how you are going to solve it. Discovery is the natural and basic first step and it should be accessible to anyone." said Ga

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new ATM malware strain dubbed  FiXS  has been observed targeting Mexican banks since the start of February 2023. "The ATM malware is hidden inside another not-malicious-looking program," Latin American cybersecurity firm Metabase Q  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. Besides requiring interaction via an external keyboard, the Windows-based ATM malware is also vendor-agnostic and is capable of infecting any teller machine that supports  CEN/XFS  (short for eXtensions for Financial Services). The exact mode of compromise remains unknown but Metabase Q's Dan Regalado told The Hacker News that it's likely that "attackers found a way to interact with the ATM via touchscreen." FiXS is also said to be similar to another strain of  ATM malware  codenamed  Ploutus  that has enabled cybercriminals to extract cash from ATMs by using an external keyboard or by  sending an SMS message . One of the notable characteristics of FiXS is its ability to disp

A pair of serious security defects has been disclosed in the Trusted Platform Module ( TPM ) 2.0 reference library specification that could potentially lead to information disclosure or privilege escalation. One of the vulnerabilities,  CVE-2023-1017 , concerns an out-of-bounds write, while the other,  CVE-2023-1018 , is described as an out-of-bounds read. Credited with discovering and reporting the issues in November 2022 is cybersecurity company Quarkslab. "These vulnerabilities can be triggered from user-mode applications by sending malicious commands to a TPM 2.0 whose firmware is based on an affected TCG reference implementation," the Trusted Computing Group (TCG)  said  in an advisory. Large tech vendors, organizations using enterprise computers, servers, IoT devices, and embedded systems that include a TPM can be impacted by the flaws, Quarkslab  noted , adding they "could affect billions of devices."

Chinese Hackers Targeting European Entities with New MQsTTang Backdoor<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/chinese-hackers-targeting-european.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The China-aligned Mustang Panda actor has been observed using a hitherto unseen custom backdoor called  MQsTTang  as part of an ongoing social engineering campaign that commenced in January 2023. "Unlike most of the group's malware, MQsTTang doesn't seem to be based on existing families or publicly available projects," ESET researcher Alexandre Côté Cyr  said  in a new report. Attack chains orchestrated by the group have stepped up targeting of European entities in the wake of  Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine  last year. The victimology of the current activity is unclear, but the Slovak cybersecurity company said the decoy filenames are in line with the group's previous campaigns that target European political organizations. That said, ESET also observed attacks against unknown entities in Bulgaria and Australia, as well as a governmental institution in Taiwan, indicating focus on Europe and Asia. Mustang Panda has a  history  of using a  remote

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has  released  a new advisory about  Royal ransomware , which emerged in the threat landscape last year. "After gaining access to victims' networks, Royal actors disable antivirus software and exfiltrate large amounts of data before ultimately deploying the ransomware and encrypting the systems," CISA  said . The custom  ransomware program , which has targeted U.S. and international organizations since September 2022, is believed to have evolved from earlier iterations that were dubbed Zeon.  What's more, it's said to be  operated  by seasoned threat actors who used to be part of Conti Team One, cybersecurity company Trend Micro disclosed in December 2022. The ransomware group employs call back phishing as a means of delivering their ransomware to victims, a technique  widely adopted  by criminal groups that splintered from the Conti enterprise last year following its shutdown.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A sophisticated attack campaign dubbed  SCARLETEEL  is targeting containerized environments to perpetrate theft of proprietary data and software. "The attacker exploited a containerized workload and then leveraged it to perform privilege escalation into an AWS account in order to steal proprietary software and credentials," Sysdig  said  in a new report. The advanced cloud attack also entailed the deployment of crypto miner software, which the cybersecurity company said is either an attempt to generate illicit profits or a ploy to distract defenders and throw them off the trail. The initial infection vector banked on exploiting a vulnerable public-facing service in a self-managed Kubernetes cluster hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Upon gaining a successful foothold, an XMRig crypto miner was launched and a bash script was used to obtain credentials that could be used to further burrow into the AWS cloud infrastructure and exfiltrate sensitive data.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Misconfigured Redis database servers are the target of a novel cryptojacking campaign that leverages a legitimate and open source command-line file transfer service to implement its attack. "Underpinning this campaign was the use of transfer[.]sh," Cado Security  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "It's possible that it's an attempt at evading detections based on other common code hosting domains (such as pastebin[.]com)." The cloud cybersecurity firm said the command line interactivity associated with transfer[.]sh has made it an ideal tool for hosting and delivering malicious payloads. The attack chain commences with targeting insecure Redis deployments, followed by registering a  cron job  that leads to arbitrary code execution when parsed by the scheduler. The job is designed to retrieve a payload hosted at transfer[.]sh. It's worth noting that  similar   attack mechanisms  have been employed by other threat actors like TeamTNT and

A new report published by LayerX, a browser security vendor, finds that attackers are exploiting this reality and are targeting it in increasing numbers ( download report here ). The key report findings  Over half of all the browsers in the enterprise environment are misconfigured.  While a configured browser is nearly impossible to compromise, stealing data from misconfigured browsers is like taking candy from a baby. The Leading misconfigurations are improper use of personal browser profiles on work devices (29%), poor patching routine (50%), and the use of corporate browser profiles on unmanaged devices. 3 of every 10 SaaS applications are non-corporate shadow SaaS,  and no SaaS discovery/security solution can address its ris

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor known as  Lucky Mouse  has developed a Linux version of a malware toolkit called SysUpdate, expanding on its ability to target devices running the operating system. The oldest version of the updated artifact dates back to July 2022, with the malware incorporating new features designed to evade security software and resist reverse engineering. Cybersecurity company Trend Micro  said  it observed the equivalent Windows variant in June 2022, nearly one month after the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure was set up. Lucky Mouse is also  tracked  under the monikers APT27, Bronze Union, Emissary Panda, and Iron Tiger, and is known to utilize a variety of malware such as  SysUpdate , HyperBro, PlugX, and a Linux backdoor dubbed rshell. Over the past two years, campaigns orchestrated by the threat group have embraced supply chain compromises of legitimate apps like  Able Desktop  and  MiMi Chat  to obtain remote access to compromised systems.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco on Wednesday rolled out  security updates  to address a critical flaw impacting its IP Phone 6800, 7800, 7900, and 8800 Series products. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-20078, is rated 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS scoring system and is described as a command injection bug in the web-based management interface arising due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Successful exploitation of the bug could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with the highest privileges on the underlying operating system. "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface," Cisco  said  in an alert published on March 1, 2023. Also patched by the company is a high-severity denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability affecting the same set of devices, as well as the Cisco Unified IP Conference Phone 8831 and Unified IP Phone 7900 Series.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Six different law firms were targeted in January and February 2023 as part of two disparate threat campaigns distributing  GootLoader  and  FakeUpdates  (aka SocGholish) malware strains. GootLoader , active since late 2020, is a first-stage downloader that's capable of delivering a wide range of secondary payloads such as Cobalt Strike and ransomware. It notably  employs  search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning to funnel victims searching for business-related documents toward drive-by download sites that drop the JavaScript malware. In the  campaign  detailed by cybersecurity company eSentire, the threat actors are said to have compromised legitimate, but vulnerable, WordPress websites and added new blog posts without the owners' knowledge. "When the computer user navigates to one of these malicious web pages and hits the link to download the purported business agreement, they are unknowingly downloading GootLoader," eSentire researcher Keegan Keplinger  said

BlackLotus Becomes First UEFI Bootkit Malware to Bypass Secure Boot on Windows 11<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/blacklotus-becomes-first-uefi-bootkit.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A stealthy Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) bootkit called BlackLotus has become the first publicly known malware capable of bypassing Secure Boot defenses, making it a potent threat in the cyber landscape. "This bootkit can run even on fully up-to-date Windows 11 systems with UEFI Secure Boot enabled," Slovak cybersecurity company ESET  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. UEFI bootkits  are deployed in the system firmware and allow full control over the operating system (OS) boot process, thereby making it possible to disable OS-level security mechanisms and deploy arbitrary payloads during startup with high privileges. Offered for sale at $5,000 (and $200 per new subsequent version), the powerful and persistent toolkit is programmed in Assembly and C and is 80 kilobytes in size. It also features geofencing capabilities to avoid infecting computers in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine. Details about BlackLotus  f

Employee well-being has become a primary focus for many businesses. Even before the pandemic, the C-suite was acutely aware of how employee mental health impacts business outcomes.  But for cybersecurity professionals, stress has always been a part of the job. A  new survey  revealed that one of the most concerning aspects of employee mental health is how it impacts cybersecurity programs and, more broadly, a business' ability to protect itself from cyberattacks. CISOs and their teams appear to be taking the brunt of unmitigated work-related stress levels and it's affecting the entire organization.  CISOs at small to midsize businesses with teams of five employees or fewer were surveyed to better understand how work-related stress is impacting CISOs – from their ability to do their job and lead their team to how it's affecting their own professional outlook and personal life. Here's what the survey results revealed.  The Impact of CISO Work-Stress Levels on Small

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has announced the general availability of client-side encryption (CSE) for Gmail and Calendar, months after  piloting the feature  in late 2022. The data privacy controls enable "even more organizations to become arbiters of their own data and the sole party deciding who has access to it," Google's Ganesh Chilakapati and Andy Wen  said . To that end, users can send and receive emails or create meeting events within their organizations or to other external parties in a manner that's encrypted "before it reaches Google servers." The company is also making available a  decrypter tool  in beta for Windows to decrypt client-side encrypted files and emails exported via its Data Export tool or Google Vault. macOS and Linux versions of the decrypter are expected to be released in the future. The development follows the  rollout of CSE  to other products such as Google Drive, Docs, Slides, Sheets, and Meet. The solution, the tech behemoth said, is aimed

Cryptocurrency companies are being targeted as part of a new campaign that delivers a remote access trojan called Parallax RAT. The malware "uses injection techniques to hide within legitimate processes, making it difficult to detect," Uptycs  said  in a new report. "Once it has been successfully injected, attackers can interact with their victim via Windows Notepad that likely serves as a communication channel." Parallax RAT  grants attackers remote access to victim machines. It comes with features to upload and download files as well as record keystrokes and screen captures. It has been put to use since early 2020 and was  previously delivered  via COVID-19-themed lures. In February 2022, Proofpoint  detailed  an activity cluster dubbed TA2541 targeting aviation, aerospace, transportation, manufacturing, and defense industries using different RATs, including Parallax.

Bitdefender Releases Free Decryptor for MortalKombat Ransomware Strain<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/bitdefender-releases-free-decryptor-for.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender has  released  a free decryptor for a new ransomware strain known as  MortalKombat . MortalKombat is a new ransomware strain that emerged in January 2023. It's based on commodity ransomware dubbed Xorist and has been observed in attacks targeting entities in the U.S., the Philippines, the U.K., and Turkey. Xorist , detected since 2010, is distributed as a ransomware builder, allowing cyber threat actors to create and customize their own version of the malware.

A new post-exploitation framework called EXFILTRATOR-22 (aka EX-22) has emerged in the wild with the goal of deploying ransomware within enterprise networks while flying under the radar. "It comes with a wide range of capabilities, making post-exploitation a cakewalk for anyone purchasing the tool," CYFIRMA  said  in a new report. Some of the notable features include establishing a reverse shell with elevated privileges, uploading and downloading files, logging keystrokes, launching ransomware to encrypt files, and starting a live VNC (Virtual Network Computing) session for real-time access. It's also equipped to persist after system reboots, perform lateral movement via a worm, view running processes, generate cryptographic hashes of files, and extract authentication tokens. The cybersecurity firm assessed with moderate confidence that threat actors responsible for creating the malware are operating from North, East, or Southeast Asia and are likely former affiliat

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As digital transformation takes hold and businesses become increasingly reliant on digital services, it has become more important than ever to secure applications and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). With that said, application security and API security are two critical components of a comprehensive security strategy. By utilizing these practices, organizations can protect themselves from malicious attacks and security threats, and most importantly, ensure their data remains secure. Interestingly enough, despite the clear advantages these disciplines provide, businesses are struggling to understand which security approach is best for their needs. So in this article, we'll discuss the differences between application and API security, best practices that you should consider, and ultimately make the case for why you need both.  What is Application Security Application security, better known as AppSec, is a critical aspect of any organization's cybersecurity strategy.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor known as Blind Eagle has been linked to a new campaign targeting various key industries in Colombia. The activity, which was detected by the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team on February 20, 2023, is also said to encompass Ecuador, Chile, and Spain, suggesting a slow expansion of the hacking group's victimology footprint. Targeted entities include health, financial, law enforcement, immigration, and an agency in charge of peace negotiation in Colombia, the Canadian cybersecurity company said. Blind Eagle, also known as  APT-C-36 , was  recently covered  by Check Point Research, detailing the adversary's advanced toolset comprising Meterpreter payloads that are delivered via spear-phishing emails. The latest set of attacks involves the group impersonating the Colombian government tax agency, the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs (DIAN), to phish its targets using lures that urge recipients to settle "outstanding obligations."

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has  added  a high-severity flaw affecting the ZK Framework to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog based on evidence of active exploitation. Tracked as  CVE-2022-36537  (CVSS score: 7.5), the issue impacts ZK Framework versions 9.6.1, 9.6.0.1, 9.5.1.3, 9.0.1.2, and 8.6.4.1, and allows threat actors to retrieve sensitive information via specially crafted requests. "The ZK Framework is an open source Java framework," CISA  said . "This vulnerability can impact multiple products, including but not limited to ConnectWise R1Soft Server Backup Manager." The  vulnerability  was patched in May 2022 in versions 9.6.2, 9.6.0.2, 9.5.1.4, 9.0.1.3, and 8.6.4.2. As  demonstrated  by Huntress in a proof-of-concept (PoC) in October 2022, the vulnerability can be weaponized to bypass authentication, upload a backdoored JDBC database driver to gain code execution, and deploy ransomware on susceptible

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
LastPass, which in December 2022 disclosed a severe data breach that allowed threat actors to access encrypted password vaults, said it happened as a result of the same adversary launching a second attack on its systems. The company said one of its DevOps engineers had their personal home computer breached and infected with a keylogger as part of a sustained cyber attack that exfiltrated sensitive data from its Amazon AWS cloud storage servers. "The threat actor leveraged information stolen during the first incident, information available from a third-party data breach, and a vulnerability in a third-party media software package to launch a coordinated second attack," the password management service  said . This intrusion targeted the company's infrastructure, resources, and one of its employees from August 12, 2022 to October 26, 2022. The original incident, on the other hand, ended on August 12, 2022. The  August breach  saw the intruders accessing source code and

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The RIG exploit kit (EK) touched an all-time high successful exploitation rate of nearly 30% in 2022, new findings reveal. "RIG EK is a financially-motivated program that has been active since 2014," Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT  said  in an exhaustive report shared with The Hacker News. "Although it has yet to substantially change its exploits in its more recent activity, the type and version of the malware they distribute constantly change. The frequency of updating samples ranges from weekly to daily updates." Exploit kits are programs used to distribute malware to large numbers of victims by taking advantage of known security flaws in commonly-used software such as web browsers. The fact that  RIG EK  runs as a service model means threat actors can financially compensate the RIG EK administrator for installing malware of their choice on victim machines. The RIG EK operators primarily employ malvertising to ensure a high infection rate and large-scale

SaaS-to-SaaS (third-party) app installations are growing  nonstop  at organizations around the world. When an employee needs an additional app to increase their efficiency or productivity, they rarely think twice before installing. Most employees don't even realize that this SaaS-to-SaaS connectivity, which requires scopes like the ability to read, update, create, and delete content, increases their organization's attack surface in a significant way. Third-party app connections typically take place outside the view of the security team, are not vetted to understand the level of risk they pose.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new ChromeLoader malware campaign has been observed being distributed via virtual hard disk (VHD) files, marking a deviation from the ISO optical disc image format. "These VHD files are being distributed with filenames that make them appear like either hacks or cracks for Nintendo and Steam games," AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC)  said  in a report last week. ChromeLoader  (aka Choziosi Loader or ChromeBack) originally surfaced in January 2022 as a browser-hijacking credential stealer but has since evolved into a more potent,  multifaceted   threat  capable of stealing sensitive data, deploying ransomware, and even dropping  decompression bombs . The primary goal of the malware is to  compromise  web browsers like Google Chrome, and modify the browser settings to intercept and direct traffic to dubious advertising websites. What's more, ChromeLoader has emerged as a conduit to  carry out click fraud  by leveraging a browser extension to monetize cl

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government entities in Asia-Pacific and North America are being targeted by an unknown threat actor with an off-the-shelf malware downloader known as PureCrypter to deliver an array of information stealers and ransomware. "The PureCrypter campaign uses the domain of a compromised non-profit organization as a command-and-control (C2) to deliver a secondary payload," Menlo Security researcher Abhay Yadav  said . The different types of malware propagated using PureCrypter include  RedLine Stealer ,  Agent Tesla ,  Eternity ,  Blackmoon  (aka  KRBanker ), and  Philadelphia  ransomware. First documented in June 2022, PureCrypter is  advertised  for sale by its author for $59 for one-month access (or $245 for a one-off lifetime purchase) and is capable of distributing a multitude of malware. In December 2022, PureCoder – the developer behind the program –  expanded  the slate of offerings to include a logger and information stealer known as PureLogs, which is designed to si

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The  PlugX  remote access trojan has been observed masquerading as an open source Windows debugger tool called x64dbg in an attempt to circumvent security protections and gain control of a target system. "This file is a legitimate open-source debugger tool for Windows that is generally used to examine kernel-mode and user-mode code, crash dumps, or CPU registers," Trend Micro researchers Buddy Tancio, Jed Valderama, and Catherine Loveria  said  in a report published last week. PlugX, also known as  Korplug , is a post-exploitation  modular implant , which, among other things, is known for its multiple functionalities such as data exfiltration and its ability to use the compromised machine for nefarious purposes. Although first documented a decade ago in 2012, early samples of the malware date as far as February 2008, according to a  Trend Micro report  at the time. Over the years, PlugX has been used by threat actors with a Chinese nexus as well as cybercrime groups. On

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Dutch police announced the arrest of three individuals in connection with a "large-scale" criminal operation involving data theft, extortion, and money laundering. The suspects include two 21-year-old men from Zandvoort and Rotterdam and an 18-year-old man without a permanent residence. The arrests were made on January 23, 2023. It's estimated that the hackers stole personal data belonging to tens of millions of individuals. This comprised names, addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, credit cards, passwords, license plates, social security numbers, and passport details. The Politie said its cybercrime team started the investigation nearly two years ago, in March 2021, after a large Dutch company suffered a security breach. The name of the company was not disclosed but some of the firms that were hit by a cyber attack around that time included  RDC ,  Shell , and  Ticketcounter , the last of which was also a victim of an extortion att

Google Teams Up with Ecosystem Partners to Enhance Security of SoC Processors<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/google-teams-up-with-ecosystem-partners.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google said it's working with ecosystem partners to harden the security of firmware that interacts with Android. While the Android operating system runs on what's called the application processor (AP), it's just one of the many processors of a system-on-chip ( SoC ) that cater to various tasks like cellular communications and multimedia processing. "Securing the Android Platform requires going beyond the confines of the Application Processor," the Android team  said . "Android's defense-in-depth strategy also applies to the firmware running on  bare-metal environments  in these microcontrollers, as they are a critical part of the attack surface of a device." The tech giant said the goal is to bolster the security of software running on these secondary processors (i.e., firmware) and make it harder to exploit vulnerabilities over the air to achieve remote code execution within the Wi-Fi SoC or the cellular baseband. To that end, Google noted tha

The use of AI in cybersecurity is growing rapidly and is having a significant impact on threat detection, incident response, fraud detection, and vulnerability management. According to a report by Juniper Research, the use of AI for fraud detection and prevention is expected to save businesses $11 billion annually by 2023. But how to integrate AI into business cybersecurity infrastructure without being exposed to hackers? In terms of detecting and responding to security threats in a more efficient and effective manner, AI has been helping businesses in lots of ways.  Firstly, it can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns or anomalies much faster and with greater accuracy than humans. AI detects and responds to security threats in real-time, reducing the time it takes to identify and remediate security incidents. The algorithms can learn from past incidents and adapt to new threats as they emerge. With it, cybersecurity systems can become smarter and more effective ove

An investigation into data safety labels for Android apps available on the Google Play Store has uncovered "serious loopholes" that allow apps to provide misleading or outright false information. The  study , conducted by the Mozilla Foundation as part of its  *Privacy Not Included  initiative, compared the privacy policies and labels of the 20 most popular paid apps and the 20 most popular free apps on the app marketplace. It  found  that, in roughly 80% of the apps reviewed, "the labels were false or misleading based on discrepancies between the apps' privacy policies and the information apps self-reported on Google's  Data safety form ." "The apps aren't self-reporting accurately enough to give the public any meaningful reassurance about the safety and privacy of their data," Mozilla further said, adding consumers are being led to "believe these apps are doing a better job protecting their privacy than they are."

Trojanized versions of legitimate applications are being used to deploy evasive cryptocurrency mining malware on macOS systems.

An earlier iteration of the campaign was  documented  exactly a year ago by Trend Micro, which pointed out the malware's use of i2p to conceal network traffic and speculated that it may have been delivered as a DMG file for Adobe Photoshop CC 2019.  The Apple device management company said the source of the cryptojacking apps can be traced to Pirate Bay, with the earliest uploads dating all the

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple threat actors have been observed opportunistically weaponizing a now-patched critical security vulnerability impacting several Zoho ManageEngine products since January 20, 2023. Tracked as  CVE-2022-47966  (CVSS score: 9.8), the  remote code execution flaw  allows a complete takeover of the susceptible systems by unauthenticated attackers. As many as  24 different products , including Access Manager Plus, ADManager Plus, ADSelfService Plus, Password Manager Pro, Remote Access Plus, and Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM), are affected by the issue. The shortcoming "allows unauthenticated remote code execution due to usage of an outdated third-party dependency for XML signature validation, Apache Santuario," Bitdefender's Martin Zugec  said  in a technical advisory shared with The Hacker News. According to the Romanian cybersecurity firm, the exploitation efforts are said to have commenced the day after penetration testing firm Horizon3.ai released a proo

The (Other) Risk in Finance A few years ago, a Washington-based real estate developer received a document link from First American – a financial services company in the real estate industry – relating to a deal he was working on. Everything about the document was perfectly fine and normal. The odd part, he  told  a reporter, was that if he changed a single digit in the URL, suddenly, he could see somebody else's document. Change it again, a different document. With no technical tools or expertise, the developer could retrieve FirstAm records dating back to 2003 – 885  million  in total, many containing the kinds of sensitive data disclosed in real estate dealings, like bank details, social security numbers, and of course, names and addresses. That nearly a billion records could leak from so simple a web vulnerability seemed shocking. Yet even more severe consequences befall financial services companies every week.

New Hacking Cluster 'Clasiopa' Targeting Materials Research Organizations in Asia<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/new-hacking-cluster-clasiopa-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Materials research organizations in Asia have been targeted by a previously unknown threat actor using a distinct set of tools. Symantec, by Broadcom Software, is tracking the cluster under the moniker  Clasiopa . The origins of the hacking group and its affiliations are currently unknown, but there are hints that suggest the adversary could have ties to India. This includes references to "SAPTARISHI-ATHARVAN-101" in a custom backdoor and the use of the password "iloveindea1998^_^" for a ZIP archive. It's worth noting that  Saptarishi , meaning "Seven sages" in Sanskrit, refers to a group of seers who are revered in Hindu literature.  Atharvan  was an ancient Hindu priest and is believed to have co-authored one of the four  Vedas , a collection of religious scriptures in Hinduism. "While these details could suggest that the group is based in India, it is also quite likely that the information was planted as false flags, with the password in

A new backdoor associated with a malware downloader named  Wslink  has been discovered, with the tool likely used by the notorious North Korea-aligned Lazarus Group, new findings reveal. The payload, dubbed  WinorDLL64  by ESET, is a fully-featured implant that can exfiltrate, overwrite, and delete files; execute PowerShell commands; and obtain comprehensive information about the underlying machine. Its other features comprise listing active sessions, creating and terminating processes, enumerating drives, and compressing directories. Wslink was  first documented  by the Slovak cybersecurity firm in October 2021, describing it as a "simple yet remarkable" malware loader that's capable of executing received modules in memory. "The Wslink payload can be leveraged later for lateral movement, due to its specific interest in network sessions," ESET researcher Vladislav Hrčka  said .

An active malware campaign has set its sights on Facebook and YouTube users by leveraging a new information stealer to hijack the accounts and abuse the systems' resources to mine cryptocurrency. Bitdefender is calling the malware  S1deload Stealer  for its use of  DLL side-loading techniques  to get past security defenses and execute its malicious components. "Once infected, S1deload Stealer steals user credentials, emulates human behavior to artificially boost videos and other content engagement, assesses the value of individual accounts (such as identifying corporate social media admins), mines for BEAM cryptocurrency, and propagates the malicious link to the user's followers," Bitdefender researcher Dávid ÁCS  said . Put differently, the goal of the campaign is to take control of the users' Facebook and YouTube accounts and rent out access to raise view counts and likes for videos and posts shared on the platforms.

Apple Warns of 3 New Vulnerabilities Affecting iPhone, iPad, and Mac Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/apple-warns-of-3-new-vulnerabilities.html"> Full Text</a>

Apple has revised the  security advisories  it released last month to include three new vulnerabilities impacting  iOS, iPadOS , and  macOS . The first flaw is a  race condition  in the Crash Reporter component (CVE-2023-23520) that could enable a malicious actor to read arbitrary files as root. The iPhone maker said it addressed the issue with additional validation. The two other vulnerabilities, credited to Trellix researcher Austin Emmitt, reside in the  Foundation framework  (CVE-2023-23530 and CVE-2023-23531) and could be weaponized to achieve code execution. "An app may be able to execute arbitrary code out of its sandbox or with certain elevated privileges," Apple said, adding it patched the issues with "improved memory handling." The medium to high-severity vulnerabilities have been patched in iOS 16.3, iPadOS 16.3, and macOS Ventura 13.2 that were shipped on January 23, 2023. Trellix, in its own report on Tuesday,  classified  the two flaws as a &qu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's a continuing assault on the open source ecosystem,  over 15,000 spam packages  have flooded the npm repository in an attempt to distribute phishing links. "The packages were created using automated processes, with project descriptions and auto-generated names that closely resembled one another," Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb  said  in a Tuesday report. "The attackers referred to retail websites using referral IDs, thus profiting from the referral rewards they earned." The modus operandi involves poisoning the registry with rogue packages that include links to phishing campaigns in their README.md files, evocative of a  similar campaign  the software supply chain security firm exposed in December 2022. The fake modules masqueraded as cheats and free resources, with some packages named as "free-tiktok-followers," "free-xbox-codes," and "instagram-followers-free."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
If you Google "third-party data breaches" you will find many recent reports of data breaches that were either caused by an attack at a third party or sensitive information stored at a third-party location was exposed. Third-party data breaches don't discriminate by industry because almost every company is operating with some sort of vendor relationship – whether it be a business partner, contractor or reseller, or the use of IT software or platform, or another service provider. Organizations are now sharing data with an average of 730 third-party vendors, according to a  report by Osano , and with the acceleration of digital transformation, that number will only grow. The Importance of Third-Party Risk Management With more organizations sharing data with more third-party vendors, it shouldn't be surprising that more than 50% of security incidents in the past two years have stemmed from a third-party with access privileges, according to a  CyberRisk Alliance report.

Hydrochasma: New Threat Actor Targets Shipping Companies and Medical Labs in Asia<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/hydrochasma-new-threat-actor-targets.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Shipping companies and medical laboratories in Asia have been the subject of a suspected espionage campaign carried out by a never-before-seen threat actor dubbed Hydrochasma . The activity, which has been ongoing since October 2022, "relies exclusively on publicly available and living-off-the-land tools," Symantec, by Broadcom Software,  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. There is no evidence available as yet to determine its origin or affiliation with known threat actors, but the cybersecurity company said the group may be having an interest in industry verticals that are involved in COVID-19-related treatments or vaccines. The standout aspects of the campaign is the absence of data exfiltration and custom malware, with the threat actor employing open source tools for intelligence gathering. By using already available tools, the goal, it appears, is to not only confuse attribution efforts, but also to make the attacks stealthier. The start of the infection

Threat Actors Adopt Havoc Framework for Post-Exploitation in Targeted Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/threat-actors-adopt-havoc-framework-for.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An open source command-and-control (C2) framework known as Havoc is being adopted by threat actors as an alternative to other well-known legitimate toolkits like  Cobalt Strike ,  Sliver , and  Brute Ratel . Cybersecurity firm Zscaler said it observed a new campaign in the beginning of January 2023 targeting an unnamed government organization that utilized  Havoc . "While C2 frameworks are prolific, the open-source Havoc framework is an advanced post-exploitation command-and-control framework capable of bypassing the most current and updated version of Windows 11 defender due to the implementation of advanced evasion techniques such as indirect syscalls and sleep obfuscation," researchers Niraj Shivtarkar and Niraj Shivtarkar  said . The attack sequence documented by Zscaler begins with a ZIP archive that embeds a decoy document and a screen-saver file that's designed to download and launch the Havoc Demon agent on the infected host. Demon is the implant generated v

Gcore Thwarts Massive 650 Gbps DDoS Attack on Free Plan Client<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/gcore-thwarts-massive-650-gbps-ddos.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
At the beginning of January, Gcore faced an incident involving several L3/L4 DDoS attacks with a peak volume of 650 Gbps. Attackers exploited over 2000 servers belonging to one of the top three cloud providers worldwide and targeted a client who was using a free CDN plan. However, due to Gcore's distribution of infrastructure and a large number of peering partners, the attacks were mitigated, and the client's web application remained available. Why was mitigating these attacks so significant? 1. These attacks were significant because they exceeded the average bandwidth of similar attacks by 60×.  The performed attacks relate to volume-based attacks targeted to saturate the attacked application's bandwidth in order to overflow it. Measuring total volume (bps)—rather than the number of requests—is the way these attacks are usually tabulated. The average bandwidth of this attack type is generally in the tens of Gbps (about 10 Gbps). Therefore, the specified attacks (at 650 Gbps) excee

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday  added  three security flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. The list of shortcomings is as follows - CVE-2022-47986  (CVSS score: 9.8) - IBM Aspera Faspex Code Execution Vulnerability CVE-2022-41223  (CVSS score: 6.8) - Mitel MiVoice Connect Code Injection Vulnerability CVE-2022-40765  (CVSS score: 6.8) - Mitel MiVoice Connect Command Injection Vulnerability CVE-2022-47986 is described as a YAML deserialization flaw in the file transfer solution that could allow a remote attacker to execute code on the system. Details of the flaw and a proof-of-concept (PoC) were  shared  by Assetnote on February 2, a day after which the Shadowserver Foundation  said  it "picked up exploitation attempts" in the wild. The active exploitation of the Aspera Faspex flaw comes shortly after a vulnerability in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT-managed fil

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware on Tuesday released patches to address a critical security vulnerability affecting its Carbon Black App Control product. Tracked as  CVE-2023-20858 , the shortcoming carries a CVSS score of 9.1 out of a maximum of 10 and impacts App Control versions 8.7.x, 8.8.x, and 8.9.x. The virtualization services provider describes the issue as an injection vulnerability. Security researcher Jari Jääskelä has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug. "A malicious actor with privileged access to the App Control administration console may be able to use specially crafted input allowing access to the underlying server operating system," the company  said  in an advisory. VMware said there are no workarounds that resolve the flaw, necessitating that customers update to versions 8.7.8, 8.8.6, and 8.9.4 to mitigate potential risks. It's worth pointing out that Jääskelä was also credited with reporting two critical vulnerabilities in the same product ( CVE-2022-229

A sophisticated botnet known as MyloBot has compromised thousands of systems, with most of them located in India, the U.S., Indonesia, and Iran. That's according to new findings from BitSight, which  said  it's "currently seeing more than 50,000 unique infected systems every day," down from a high of 250,000 unique hosts in 2020. Furthermore, an analysis of MyloBot's infrastructure has found connections to a residential proxy service called BHProxies, indicating that the compromised machines are being used by the latter. MyloBot, which emerged on the threat landscape in 2017, was  first documented  by Deep Instinct in 2018, calling out its anti-analysis techniques and its ability to function as a downloader. "What makes Mylobot dangerous is its ability to download and execute any type of payload after it infects a host," Lumen's Black Lotus Labs  said  in November 2018.

As the digital age evolves and continues to shape the business landscape, corporate networks have become increasingly complex and distributed. The amount of data a company collects to detect malicious behaviour constantly increases, making it challenging to detect deceptive and unknown attack patterns and the so-called "needle in the haystack". With a growing number of cybersecurity threats, such as data breaches, ransomware attacks, and malicious insiders, organizations are facing significant challenges in successfully monitoring and securing their networks. Furthermore, the talent shortage in the field of cybersecurity makes manual threat hunting and log correlation a cumbersome and difficult task. To address these challenges, organizations are turning to predictive analytics and Machine Learning (ML) driven network security solutions as essential tools for securing their networks against cyber threats and the unknown bad.

A new information stealer called  Stealc  that's being advertised on the dark web could emerge as a worthy competitor to other malware of its ilk. "The threat actor presents Stealc as a fully featured and ready-to-use stealer, whose development relied on  Vidar ,  Raccoon ,  Mars , and  RedLine  stealers," SEKOIA  said  in a Monday report. The French cybersecurity company said it  discovered   more than   40 Stealc samples  distributed in the wild and 35 active command-and-control (C2) servers, suggesting that the malware is already gaining traction among criminal groups. Stealc, first marketed by an actor named Plymouth on the XSS and BHF Russian-speaking underground forums on January 9, 2023, is written in C and comes with capabilities to steal data from web browsers, crypto wallets, email clients, and messaging apps.

Popular cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase disclosed that it experienced a cybersecurity attack that targeted its employees. The company  said  its "cyber controls prevented the attacker from gaining direct system access and prevented any loss of funds or compromise of customer information." The incident, which took place on February 5, 2023, resulted in the exposure of a "limited amount of data" from its directory, including employee names, e-mail addresses, and some phone numbers. As part of the attack, several employees were targeted in an SMS phishing campaign urging them to sign in to their company accounts to read an important message. One employee is said to have fallen for the scam, who entered their username and password in a fake login page set up by the threat actors to harvest the credentials.

Cybersecurity firm ThreatMon  attributed  the activity to a threat actor tracked as  SideCopy . SideCopy is a threat group of Pakistani origin that shares overlaps with another actor called  Transparent Tribe . It is so named for mimicking the infection chains associated with  SideWinder  to deliver its own malware. The adversarial crew was first observed delivering ReverseRAT in 2021, when Lumen's Black Lotus Labs  detailed  a set of attacks targeting victims aligned with the government and power utility verticals in India and Afghanistan. Recent attack campaigns associated with SideCopy have primarily  set their sights  on a two-factor authentication solution known as Kavach (meaning "armor" in Hindi) that's used by Indian government officials. The infection journey documented by ThreatMon commences with a phishing email containi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Norwegian police agency Økokrim has announced the seizure of 60 million NOK (about $5.84 million) worth of cryptocurrency stolen by the Lazarus Group in March 2022 following the Axie Infinity Ronin Bridge hack. "This case shows that we also have a great capacity to follow the money on the blockchain, even if the criminals use advanced methods," the agency  said  in a statement. The development comes more than 10 months after the U.S. Treasury Department  implicated  the North Korea-backed hacking group for the theft of $620 million from the Ronin cross-chain bridge. Then in September 2022, the U.S. government  announced  the recovery of more than $30 million worth of cryptocurrency, representing 10% of the stolen funds. Økokrim said it worked with international law enforcement partners to follow and piece together the money trail, thereby making it more difficult for criminal actors to carry out money laundering activities.

Unknown malware presents a significant cybersecurity threat and can cause serious damage to organizations and individuals alike. When left undetected, malicious code can gain access to confidential information, corrupt data, and allow attackers to gain control of systems. Find out how to avoid these circumstances and detect unknown malicious behavior efficiently.  Challenges of new threats' detection While known malware families are more predictable and can be detected more easily, unknown threats can take on a variety of forms, causing a bunch of challenges for their detection: Malware developers use polymorphism, which enables them to modify the malicious code to generate unique variants of the same malware.  There is malware that is still not identified and doesn't have any rulesets for detection. Some threats can be Fully UnDetectable (FUD) for some time and challenge perimeter security.  The code is often encrypted, making it difficult to detect by signature-based

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Russia's cyber attacks against Ukraine surged by 250% in 2022 when compared to two years ago, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Mandiant disclosed in a new joint report. The targeting, which  coincided  and has  since persisted  following the country's military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, focused heavily on the Ukrainian government and military entities, alongside critical infrastructure, utilities, public services, and media sectors. Mandiant  said  it observed, "more destructive cyber attacks in Ukraine during the first four months of 2022 than in the previous eight years with attacks peaking around the start of the invasion." As many as six unique wiper strains – including WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, Industroyer2, and SDelete – have been deployed against Ukrainian networks, suggesting a willingness on the part of Russian threat actors to forgo persistent access. Phishing attacks aimed at NATO countries witnessed a 3

Cyber Espionage Group Earth Kitsune Deploys WhiskerSpy Backdoor in Latest Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/north-korean-cyber-espionage-group.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The cyber espionage threat actor tracked as  Earth Kitsune  has been observed deploying a new backdoor called WhiskerSpy as part of a social engineering campaign. Earth Kitsune, active since at least 2019, is  known  to primarily target individuals interested in North Korea with self-developed malware such as dneSpy and agfSpy. Previously documented intrusions have entailed the use of watering holes that leverage browser exploits in Google Chrome and Internet Explorer to activate the infection chain. The differentiating factor in the latest attacks is a shift to social engineering to trick users into visiting compromised websites related to North Korea, according to a new report from Trend Micro released last week. The cybersecurity company said the website of an unnamed pro-North Korean organization was hacked and modified to distribute the WhiskerSpy implant. The compromise was discovered at the end of last year. "When a targeted visitor tries to watch videos on the websit

Samsung Introduces New Feature to Protect Users from Zero-Click Malware Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/samsung-introduces-new-feature-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Samsung has announced a new feature called Message Guard that comes with safeguards to protect users from malware and spyware via what's referred to as zero-click attacks . The South Korean chaebol said the solution "preemptively" secures users' devices by "limiting exposure to invisible threats disguised as image attachments." The security feature, available on Samsung Messages and Google Messages, is currently limited to the Samsung Galaxy S23 series, with plans to expand it to other Galaxy smartphones and tablets later this year that are running on One UI 5.1 or higher. Zero-click attacks are highly-targeted and sophisticated attacks that exploit previously unknown flaws (i.e., zero-days) in software to trigger execution of malicious code without requiring any user interaction. Unlike traditional methods of remotely exploiting a device wherein threat actors rely on phishing tactics to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link or opening an rog

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Twitter has announced that it's limiting the use of SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) to its Blue subscribers. "While historically a popular form of 2FA, unfortunately we have seen phone-number based 2FA be used – and abused – by bad actors," the company  said . "We will no longer allow accounts to enroll in the text message/SMS method of 2FA unless they are Twitter Blue subscribers." Twitter users who have not subscribed to Blue that have enrolled for SMS-based 2FA have time till March 20, 2023, to switch to an alternative method such as an authenticator app or a hardware security key. After this cutoff date, non-Twitter Blue subscribers will have their option disabled. The alternative methods "require you to have physical possession of the authentication method and are a great way to ensure your account is secure," Twitter noted. Given that SMS has been the  least secure form of 2FA , the latest enforcement is likely to force people

GoDaddy Discloses Multi-Year Security Breach Causing Malware Installations and Source Code Theft<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/godaddy-discloses-multi-year-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Web hosting services provider GoDaddy on Friday disclosed a multi-year security breach that enabled unknown threat actors to install malware and siphon source code related to some of its services. The company attributed the campaign to a "sophisticated and organized group targeting hosting services." GoDaddy said in December 2022, it received an unspecified number of customer complaints about their websites getting sporadically redirected to malicious sites, which it later found was due to the unauthorized third party gaining access to servers hosted in its  cPanel environment . The threat actor "installed malware causing the intermittent redirection of customer websites," the company  said . The ultimate objective of the intrusions, GoDaddy said, is to "infect websites and servers with malware for phishing campaigns, malware distribution, and other malicious activities." In a related 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC

Experts Warn of RambleOn Android Malware Targeting South Korean Journalists<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/experts-warn-of-rambleon-android.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Suspected North Korean nation-state actors targeted a journalist in South Korea with a malware-laced Android app as part of a social engineering campaign. The findings come from South Korea-based non-profit Interlab, which coined the new malware  RambleOn . The malicious functionalities include the "ability to read and leak target's contact list, SMS, voice call content, location and others from the time of compromise on the target," Interlab threat researcher Ovi Liber  said  in a report published this week. The spyware camouflages as a secure chat app called  Fizzle  (ch.seme), but in reality, acts as a conduit to deliver a next-stage payload hosted on pCloud and Yandex. The chat app is said to have been sent as an Android Package (APK) file over WeChat to the targeted journalist on December 7, 2022, under the pretext of wanting to discuss a sensitive topic. The primary purpose of RambleOn is to function as a loader for another APK file ( com.data.WeCoin ) while

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new variant of the notorious Mirai botnet has been found leveraging several security vulnerabilities to propagate itself to Linux and IoT devices. Observed during the second half of 2022, the new version has been dubbed  V3G4  by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, which identified three different campaigns likely conducted by the same threat actor. "Once the vulnerable devices are compromised, they will be fully controlled by attackers and become a part of the botnet," Unit 42 researchers  said . "The threat actor has the capability to utilize those devices to conduct further attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks." The attacks primarily single out exposed servers and networking devices running Linux, with the adversary weaponizing as many as 13 flaws that could lead to remote code execution (RCE). Some of the notable flaws relate to critical flaws in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center, DrayTek Vigor routers, Airspan AirSpot, and Geu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco has rolled out security updates to address a critical flaw reported in the ClamAV open source antivirus engine that could lead to remote code execution on susceptible devices. Tracked as  CVE-2023-20032  (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue relates to a case of remote code execution residing in the HFS+ file parser component. The flaw affects versions 1.0.0 and earlier, 0.105.1 and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier. Google security engineer Simon Scannell has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug. "This vulnerability is due to a missing buffer size check that may result in a heap buffer overflow write," Cisco Talos  said  in an advisory. "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HFS+ partition file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device." Successful exploitation of the weakness could enable an adversary to run arbitrary code with the same privileges as that of the ClamAV scanning process, or crash the process, resu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A popular npm package with more than 3.5 million weekly downloads has been found vulnerable to an account takeover attack. "The package can be taken over by recovering an expired domain name for one of its maintainers and resetting the password," software supply chain security company Illustria  said  in a report. While npm's security protections limit users to have only one active email address per account, the Israeli firm said it was able to reset the GitHub password using the recovered domain. The attack, in a nutshell, grants a threat actor access to the package's associated GitHub account, effectively making it possible to publish trojanized versions to the npm registry that can be weaponized to conduct supply chain attacks at scale. This is achieved by taking advantage of a GitHub Action that's configured in the repository to automatically publish the packages when new code changes are pushed. "Even though the maintainer's npm user account i

The prolific  SideWinder  group has been attributed as the nation-state actor behind attempted attacks against 61 entities in Afghanistan, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka between June and November 2021. Targets included government, military, law enforcement, banks, and other organizations, according to an  exhaustive report  published by Group-IB, which also found links between the adversary and two other intrusion sets tracked as Baby Elephant and  DoNot Team . SideWinder  is also referred to as APT-C-17, Hardcore Nationalist (HN2), Rattlesnake, Razor Tiger, and T-APT4. It's suspected to be of Indian origin, although Kaspersky in 2022 noted that the attribution is no longer deterministic. The  group  has been linked to  no less than 1,000 attacks  against government organizations in the Asia-Pacific region since April 2020, according to a report from the Russian cybersecurity firm early last year. Of the 61 potential targets compiled by Group-IB, 29 of them are located

Chinese-speaking individuals in Southeast and East Asia are the targets of a new rogue Google Ads campaign that delivers remote access trojans such as FatalRAT to compromised machines. The attacks involve purchasing ad slots to appear in Google search results that direct users searching for popular applications to rogue websites hosting trojanized installers, ESET said in a report published today. The ads have since been taken down. Some of the spoofed applications include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Telegram, WhatsApp, LINE, Signal, Skype, Electrum, Sogou Pinyin Method, Youdao, and WPS Office. "The websites and installers downloaded from them are mostly in Chinese and in some cases falsely offer Chinese language versions of software that is not available in China," the Slovak cybersecurity firm  said , adding it observed the attacks between August 2022 and January 2023.

Researchers Warn of Critical Security Bugs in Schneider Electric Modicon PLCs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/researchers-warn-of-critical-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have disclosed two new vulnerabilities affecting Schneider Electric Modicon programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that could allow for authentication bypass and remote code execution. The flaws, tracked as  CVE-2022-45788  (CVSS score: 7.5) and  CVE-2022-45789  (CVSS score: 8.1), are part of a  broader collection  of  security defects  tracked by Forescout as OT:ICEFALL. Successful exploitation of the bugs could enable an adversary to execute unauthorized code, denial-of-service, or disclosure of sensitive information. The cybersecurity company said the shortcomings can be chained by a threat actor with known flaws from other vendors (e.g.,  CVE-2021-31886 ) to achieve deep lateral movement in operational technology (OT) networks. "Deep lateral movement lets attackers gain deep access to industrial control systems and cross often overlooked security perimeters, allowing them to perform highly granular and stealthy manipulations as well as override funct

Security teams typically have great visibility over most areas, for example, the corporate network, endpoints, servers, and cloud infrastructure. They use this visibility to enforce the necessary security and compliance requirements. However, this is not the case when it comes to sensitive data sitting in production or analytic databases, data warehouses or data lakes. Security teams have to rely on data teams to locate sensitive data and enforce access controls and security policies. This is a huge headache for both the security and data teams. It weakens the business's security and compliance putting it at risk of exposing sensitive data, large fines, reputational damages, and more. Also, in many cases, it slows down the business's ability to scale up data operations.  This article examines how Satori, a data security platform, gives control of the sensitive data in databases, data warehouses and data lakes to the security teams.

Telecommunication service providers in the Middle East are being targeted by a previously undocumented threat actor as part of a suspected intelligence gathering mission. Cybersecurity firms SentinelOne and QGroup are tracking the activity cluster under the former's work-in-progress moniker  WIP26 . "WIP26 relies heavily on public cloud infrastructure in an attempt to evade detection by making malicious traffic look legitimate," researchers Aleksandar Milenkoski, Collin Farr, and Joey Chen  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. This includes the misuse of Microsoft 365 Mail, Azure, Google Firebase, and Dropbox for malware delivery, data exfiltration, and command-and-control (C2) purposes. The initial intrusion vector used in the attacks entails "precision targeting" of employees via WhatsApp messages that contain links to Dropbox links to supposedly benign archive files.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More than 500 hosts have been newly compromised en masse by the ESXiArgs ransomware strain, most of which are located in France, Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K., and Ukraine. The  findings  come from attack surface management firm Censys, which  discovered  "two hosts with strikingly similar ransom notes dating back to mid-October 2022, just after ESXi versions 6.5 and 6.7 reached end of life." The first set of infections dates back to October 12, 2022, much earlier than when the campaign  began to gain traction  at the start of February 2023. Then on January 31, 2023, the ransom notes on the two hosts are said to have been updated with a revised version that matches the ones used in the current wave. Some of the crucial differences between the two ransom notes include the use of an onion URL instead of a Tox chat ID, a Proton Mail address at the bottom of the note, and a lower ransom demand (1.05 Bitcoin vs. 2.09 Bitcoin).
