  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has  added  a batch of six flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. This comprises three vulnerabilities that Apple patched this week ( CVE-2023-32434, CVE-2023-32435, and CVE-2023-32439 ), two flaws in VMware ( CVE-2023-20867  and  CVE-2023-20887 ), and one shortcoming impacting Zyxel devices ( CVE-2023-27992 ). CVE-2023-32434 and CVE-2023-32435, both of which allow code execution, are said to have been exploited as zero-days to deploy spyware as part of a years-long cyber espionage campaign that commenced in 2019. Dubbed Operation Triangulation, the activity culminates in the deployment of  TriangleDB  that's designed to harvest a wide range of information from compromised devices, such as creating, modifying, removing, and stealing files, listing and terminating processes, gathering credentials from iCloud Keychain, and tracking a user's location.

A U.K. citizen who took part in the massive July 2020 hack of Twitter has been sentenced to five years in prison in the U.S. Joseph James O'Connor (aka PlugwalkJoe), 24, was awarded the sentence on Friday in the Southern District of New York, a little over a month  after  he  pleaded guilty  to the criminal schemes. He was  arrested  in Spain in July 2021. The infamous Twitter breach allowed the defendant and his co-conspirators to obtain unauthorized access to backend tools used by Twitter, abusing them to hijack 130 popular accounts to perpetrate a crypto scam that netted them about $120,000 in illegal profits. "In other instances, the co-conspirators sold access to Twitter accounts to others," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)  said . "O'Connor communicated with others regarding purchasing unauthorized access to a variety of Twitter accounts, including accounts associated with public figures around the world."

Cybercrime Group 'Muddled Libra' Targets BPO Sector with Advanced Social Engineering<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/cybercrime-group-muddled-libra-targets.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor known as  Muddled Libra  is targeting the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry with persistent attacks that leverage advanced social engineering ploys to gain initial access. "The attack style defining Muddled Libra appeared on the cybersecurity radar in late 2022 with the release of the 0ktapus phishing kit, which offered a prebuilt hosting framework and bundled templates," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42  said  in a technical report. Libra is the  designation  given by the cybersecurity company for cybercrime groups. The "muddled" moniker for the threat actor stems from the prevailing ambiguity with regards to the use of the 0ktapus framework. 0ktapus , also known as Scatter Swine, refers to an intrusion set that first came to light in August 2022 in connection with smishing attacks against over 100 organizations, including Twilio and Cloudflare. Then in late 2022, CrowdStrike  detailed  a string of cyber assaults aimed at telecom and BPO co

The case for browser fingerprinting: personalizing user experience, improving fraud detection, and optimizing login security Have you ever heard of browser fingerprinting? You should! It's an online user identification technique that collects information about a visitor's web browser and its configuration preferences to associate individual browsing sessions with a single website visitor.  With browser fingerprinting, many pieces of data can be collected about a user's web browser and device, such as screen resolution, location, language, and operating system. When you stitch these pieces together, they reveal a unique combination of information that forms every user's visitor ID or "digital fingerprint." Websites can use the visitor ID in various ways, including personalizing the user's experience, improving fraud detection, and optimizing login security.

Powerful JavaScript Dropper PindOS Distributes Bumblebee and IcedID Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/powerful-javascript-dropper-pindos.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new strain of JavaScript dropper has been observed delivering next-stage payloads like Bumblebee and IcedID. Cybersecurity firm Deep Instinct is tracking the malware as  PindOS , which contains the name in its " User-Agent " string. Both  Bumblebee  and IcedID serve as loaders, acting as a vector for other malware on compromised hosts, including ransomware. A recent report from Proofpoint  highlighted  IcedID's abandoning of banking fraud features to solely focus on malware delivery. Bumblebee , notably, is a replacement for another loader called  BazarLoader , which has been attributed to the now-defunct TrickBot and Conti groups. A report from Secureworks in April 2022  found  evidence of collaboration between several actors in the Russian cybercrime ecosystem, including that of  Conti ,  Emotet , and IcedID. Deep Instinct's source code analysis of PindOS shows that it contains comments in Russian, raising the possibility of a continued partnership between

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) on Thursday released guidance to help organizations detect and prevent infections of a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) bootkit called  BlackLotus . To that end, the agency is  recommending  that "infrastructure owners take action by hardening user executable policies and monitoring the integrity of the boot partition." BlackLotus is an  advanced  crimeware solution that was first spotlighted in October 2022 by Kaspersky. A UEFI bootkit capable of bypassing Windows Secure Boot protections, samples of the malware have since emerged in the wild. This is accomplished by taking advantage of a known Windows flaw called Baton Drop ( CVE-2022-21894 , CVSS score: 4.4) discovered in vulnerable  boot loaders  not added into the  Secure Boot DBX revocation list . The vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft in January 2022. This loophole could be exploited by threat actors to replace fully patched boot loaders with vulnerable v

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Internet-facing Linux systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being targeted as part of a new campaign designed to illicitly mine cryptocurrency. "The threat actors behind the attack use a backdoor that deploys a wide array of tools and components such as rootkits and an IRC bot to steal device resources for mining operations," Microsoft threat intelligence researcher Rotem Sde-Or  said . "The backdoor also installs a patched version of OpenSSH on affected devices, allowing threat actors to hijack SSH credentials, move laterally within the network, and conceal malicious SSH connections." To pull off the scheme, misconfigured Linux hosts are brute-forced to gain initial access, following which the threat actors move to disable shell history and fetch a trojanized version of OpenSSH from a remote server. The rogue OpenSSH package is configured to install and launch the backdoor, a shell script that allows the attackers to distribute additional payloads a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing campaign codenamed  MULTI#STORM  has set its sights on India and the U.S. by leveraging JavaScript files to deliver remote access trojans on compromised systems. "The attack chain ends with the victim machine infected with multiple unique RAT (remote access trojan) malware instances, such as Warzone RAT and Quasar RAT," Securonix researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov  said . "Both are used for command-and-control during different stages of the infection chain." The multi-stage attack chain commences when an email recipient clicks the embedded link pointing to a password-protected ZIP file ("REQUEST.zip") hosted on Microsoft OneDrive with the password "12345." Extracting the archive file reveals a heavily obfuscated JavaScript file ("REQUEST.js") that, when double clicked, activates the infection by executing two PowerShell commands that are responsible for retrieving two separate payloads from OneDri

Alert: Million of GitHub Repositories Likely Vulnerable to RepoJacking Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/alert-million-of-github-repositories.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Millions of software repositories on GitHub are likely vulnerable to an attack called RepoJacking , a new study has revealed. This includes repositories from organizations such as Google, Lyft, and several others, Massachusetts-based cloud-native security firm Aqua  said  in a Wednesday report. The supply chain vulnerability, also known as dependency repository hijacking, is a  class of attacks  that makes it possible to take over retired organization or user names and publish trojanized versions of repositories to run malicious code. "When a repository owner changes their username, a link is created between the old name and the new name for anyone who downloads dependencies from the old repository," researchers Ilay Goldman and Yakir Kadkoda said. "However, it is possible for anyone to create the old username and break this link." Alternatively, a similar scenario could arise when a repository ownership is transferred to another user and the original account

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Chinese cyber espionage actor known as  Camaro Dragon  has been observed leveraging a new strain of self-propagating malware that spreads through compromised USB drives. "While their primary focus has traditionally been Southeast Asian countries, this latest discovery reveals their global reach and highlights the alarming role USB drives play in spreading malware," Check Point said in new research shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company, which found evidence of USB malware infections in Myanmar, South Korea, Great Britain, India, and Russia, said the findings are the result of a cyber incident that it investigated at an unnamed European hospital in early 2023. The probe found that the entity was not directly targeted by the adversary but rather suffered a breach via an employee's USB drive, which became infected when it was plugged into a colleague's computer at a conference in Asia.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Why Data Exfiltration Detection is Paramount? The world is witnessing an exponential rise in ransomware and data theft employed to extort companies. At the same time, the industry faces numerous critical vulnerabilities in database software and company websites. This evolution paints a dire picture of data exposure and exfiltration that every security leader and team is grappling with. This article highlights this challenge and expounds on the benefits that Machine Learning algorithms and Network Detection & Response (NDR) approaches bring to the table. Data exfiltration often serves as the final act of a cyberattack, making it the last window of opportunity to detect the breach before the data is made public or is used for other sinister activities, such as espionage. However, data leakage isn't only an aftermath of cyberattacks, it can also be a consequence of human error. While prevention of data exfiltration through security controls is ideal, the escalating complexity a

A critical security flaw has been disclosed in the WordPress "Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce" plugin that's  installed  on more than 30,000 websites. "This vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker to gain access to the accounts of users who have abandoned their carts, who are typically customers but can extend to other high-level users when the right conditions are met," Defiant's Wordfence  said  in an advisory. Tracked as CVE-2023-2986, the shortcoming has been rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS scoring system. It impacts all versions of the plugin, including and prior to versions 5.14.2. The problem, at its core, is a case of authentication bypass that arises as a result of insufficient encryption protections that are applied when customers are notified when they have abandoned their shopping carts on e-commerce sites without completing the purchase. Specifically, the encryption key is hard-coded in the plugin, thereby allowing

The North Korean threat actor known as ScarCruft has been observed using an information-stealing malware with previous undocumented wiretapping features as well as a backdoor developed using Golang that exploits the Ably real-time messaging service. "The threat actor sent their commands through the Golang backdoor that is using the Ably service," the AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC) said in a technical report. "The API key value required for command communication was saved in a GitHub repository." ScarCruft is a state-sponsored outfit with links to North Korea's Ministry of State Security (MSS). It's known to be active since at least 2012. Attack chains mounted by the group entail the use of spear-phishing lures to deliver RokRAT , although it has leveraged a wide range of other custom tools to harvest sensitive information.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More details have emerged about the spyware implant that's delivered to iOS devices as part of a campaign called Operation Triangulation. Kaspersky, which  discovered the operation  after becoming one of the targets at the start of the year, said the malware has a lifespan of 30 days, after which it gets automatically uninstalled unless the time period is extended by the attackers. The Russian cybersecurity company has codenamed the backdoor  TriangleDB . "The implant is deployed after the attackers obtain root privileges on the target iOS device by exploiting a kernel vulnerability," Kaspersky researchers  said  in a new report published today. "It is deployed in memory, meaning that all traces of the implant are lost when the device gets rebooted. Therefore, if the victim reboots their device, the attackers have to reinfect it by sending an iMessage with a malicious attachment, thus launching the whole exploitation chain again." Operation Triangulation

Declaring your intentions There is value in making "reducing friction" an explicit goal of your security program. It sets the right tone with your counterparts across the organization, and is one step toward building a positive security culture.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security shortcoming in Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) Open Authorization ( OAuth ) process could have been exploited to achieve full account takeover, researchers said. California-based identity and access management service Descope, which discovered and reported the issue in April 2023, dubbed it  nOAuth . "nOAuth is an authentication implementation flaw that can affect Microsoft Azure AD multi-tenant OAuth applications," Omer Cohen, chief security officer at Descope,  said . The misconfiguration has to do with how a malicious actor can modify email attributes under "Contact Information" in the Azure AD account and exploit the "Log in with Microsoft" feature to hijack a victim account. To pull off the attack, all an adversary has to do is to create and access an Azure AD admin account and modify their email address to that of a victim and take advantage of the single sign-on scheme on a vulnerable app or website.

Foreign affairs ministries in the Americas have been targeted by a Chinese state-sponsored actor named  Flea  as part of a recent campaign that spanned from late 2022 to early 2023. The cyber attacks, per Broadcom's Symantec, involved a new backdoor codenamed Graphican. Some of the other targets included a government finance department and a corporation that markets products in the Americas as well as one unspecified victim in an European country. "Flea used a large number of tools in this campaign," the company  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News, describing the threat actor as "large and well-resourced." "As well as the new Graphican backdoor, the attackers leveraged a variety of living-off-the-land tools, as well as tools that have been previously linked to Flea."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware called  Condi  has been observed exploiting a security vulnerability in TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800) Wi-Fi routers to rope the devices into a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet. Fortinet FortiGuard Labs  said  the campaign has ramped up since the end of May 2023. Condi is the work of a threat actor who goes by the online alias zxcr9999 on Telegram and runs a Telegram channel called Condi Network to advertise their warez. "The Telegram channel was started in May 2022, and the threat actor has been monetizing its botnet by providing DDoS-as-a-service and selling the malware source code," security researchers Joie Salvio and Roy Tay said. An analysis of the malware artifact reveals its ability to terminate other competing botnets on the same host. It, however, lacks a persistence mechanism, meaning the program cannot survive a system reboot. To get around this limitation, the malware deletes multiple binaries that are used to shut down or reboot the

Three security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in operational technology (OT) products from Wago and Schneider Electric. The flaws, per Forescout, are part of a  broader   set  of  shortcomings  collectively called  OT:ICEFALL , which now comprises a total of 61 issues spanning 13 different vendors. "OT:ICEFALL demonstrates the need for tighter scrutiny of, and improvements to, processes related to secure design, patching and testing in OT device vendors," the company  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. The most severe of the flaws is  CVE-2022-46680  (CVSS score: 8.8), which concerns the plaintext transmission of credentials in the ION/TCP protocol used by power meters from Schneider Electric. Successful exploitation of the bug could enable threat actors to gain control of vulnerable devices. It's worth noting that CVE-2022-46680 is one among the 56 flaws  originally unearthed  by Forescout in June 2022. The other two new security holes ( CVE-2023

The Quick Serve Restaurant (QSR) industry is built on consistency and shared resources. National chains like McDonald's and regional ones like Cracker Barrel grow faster by reusing the same business model, decor, and menu, with little change from one location to the next.  QSR technology stacks mirror the consistency of the front end of each store. Despite each franchise being independently owned and operated, they share subscriptions to SaaS applications, or use multiple tenants of the same application. Each app is typically segmented by store. Corporate IT and Security has access to the entire database, while each franchise has visibility into its own data.  These SaaS apps cover everything from CRMs to supply chains to marketing and HR. The data within is used to understand consumer habits, improve marketing campaigns, and manage employees. Like every other industry, QSR SaaS apps contain a wealth of data that needs to be secured.  At the same time, we're seeing food cha

Experts Uncover Year-Long Cyber Attack on IT Firm Utilizing Custom Malware RDStealer<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/experts-uncover-year-long-cyber-attack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A highly targeted cyber attack against an East Asian IT company involved the deployment of a custom malware written in Golang called  RDStealer . "The operation was active for more than a year with the end goal of compromising credentials and data exfiltration," Bitdefender security researcher Victor Vrabie  said  in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. Evidence gathered by the Romanian cybersecurity firm shows that the campaign started in early 2022. The target was an unspecified IT company located in East Asia. In the early phases, the operation relied on readily available remote access trojans like AsyncRAT and Cobalt Strike, before transitioning to bespoke malware in late 2021 or early 2022 in a bid to thwart detection. A primary evasion tactic concerns the use of Microsoft Windows folders that are likely to be excluded from scanning by security software (e.g., System32 and Program Files) to store the backdoor payloads. One of the sub-folders in question

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Individuals in the Pakistan region have been targeted using two rogue Android apps available on the Google Play Store as part of a new targeted campaign. Cybersecurity firm Cyfirma attributed the campaign with moderate confidence to a threat actor known as  DoNot Team , which is also tracked as APT-C-35 and Viceroy Tiger. The espionage activity involves duping Android smartphone owners into downloading a program that's used to extract contact and location data from unwitting victims. "The motive behind the attack is to gather information via the stager payload and use the gathered information for the second-stage attack, using malware with more destructive features," the company  said . DoNot Team  is a suspected India-nexus threat actor that has a reputation for carrying out attacks against various countries in South Asia. It has been active since at least 2016.

New Mystic Stealer Malware Targets 40 Web Browsers and 70 Browser Extensions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-mystic-stealer-malware-targets-40.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new information-stealing malware called  Mystic Stealer  has been found to steal data from about 40 different web browsers and over 70 web browser extensions. First advertised on April 25, 2023, for $150 per month, the malware also targets cryptocurrency wallets, Steam, and Telegram, and employs extensive mechanisms to resist analysis. "The code is heavily obfuscated making use of polymorphic string obfuscation, hash-based import resolution, and runtime calculation of constants,"  InQuest  and  Zscaler  researchers said in an analysis published last week. Mystic Stealer, like many other crimeware solutions that are offered for sale, focuses on pilfering data and is implemented in the C programming language. The control panel has been developed using Python. Updates to the malware in May 2023 incorporate a loader component that allows it to retrieve and execute next-stage payloads fetched from a command-and-control (C2) server, making it a more formidable threat.

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a set of malicious artifacts that they say is part of a sophisticated toolkit targeting Apple macOS systems. "As of now, these samples are still largely undetected and very little information is available about any of them," Bitdefender researchers Andrei Lapusneanu and Bogdan Botezatu  said  in a preliminary report published on Friday. The Romanian firm's analysis is based on an examination of four samples that were uploaded to VirusTotal by an unnamed victim. The earliest sample dates back to April 18, 2023. Two of the three malicious programs are said to be generic Python-based backdoors that are designed to target Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. The payloads have been collectively dubbed  JokerSpy . The first constituent is shared.dat, which, once launched, runs an operating system check (0 for Windows, 1 for macOS, and 2 for Linux) and establishes contact with a remote server to fetch additional instructions for execut

Microsoft on Friday attributed a string of service outages aimed at Azure, Outlook, and OneDrive earlier this month to an uncategorized cluster it tracks under the name  Storm-1359 .

Storm-#### (previously DEV-####) is a temporary designation the Windows maker assigns to unknown, emerging, or developing groups whose identity or affiliation hasn't been definitively established yet. While there is no evidence that any customer data was accessed or compromised, the company noted the attacks "temporarily impacted availability" of some services. Redmond said it further observed the threat actor launching  layer 7 DDoS attacks  from multiple cloud services and open proxy infrastructures.

From Cryptojacking to DDoS Attacks: Diicot Expands Tactics with Cayosin Botnet<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/from-cryptojacking-to-ddos-attacks.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered previously undocumented payloads associated with a Romanian threat actor named  Diicot , revealing its potential for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. "The Diicot name is significant, as it's also the name of the  Romanian organized crime and anti-terrorism policing unit ," Cado Security  said  in a technical report. "In addition, artifacts from the group's campaigns contain messaging and imagery related to this organization." Diicot (née Mexals) was  first documented  by Bitdefender in July 2021, uncovering the actor's use of a Go-based SSH brute-forcer tool called Diicot Brute to breach Linux hosts as part of a cryptojacking campaign. Then earlier this April, Akamai  disclosed  what it described as a "resurgence" of the 2021 activity that's believed to have started around October 2022, netting the actor about $10,000 in illicit profits. "The attackers use a long ch

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor known as  ChamelGang  has been observed using a previously undocumented implant to backdoor Linux systems, marking a new expansion of the threat actor's capabilities. The malware, dubbed  ChamelDoH  by Stairwell, is a C++-based tool for communicating via DNS-over-HTTPS ( DoH ) tunneling. ChamelGang was  first outed  by Russian cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies in September 2021, detailing its attacks on fuel, energy, and aviation production industries in Russia, the U.S., India, Nepal, Taiwan, and Japan. Attack chains mounted by the actor have leveraged vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application to gain initial access and carry out data theft attacks using a passive backdoor called DoorMe. "This is a native  IIS module  that is registered as a filter through which HTTP requests and responses are processed," Positive Technologies said at the time.

As Threat Actors Continuously Adapt their TTPs in Today's Threat Landscape, So Must You Earlier this year, threat researchers at Cybersixgill released the annual report,  The State of the Cybercrime Underground .  The research stems from an analysis of Cybersixgill's collected intelligence items throughout 2022, gathered from the deep, dark and clear web. The report examines the continuous evolution of threat actors' tactics, tools, and procedures (TTPs) in the Digital Age – and how organizations can adapt to reduce risk and maintain business resilience. This article summarizes a few of the report's findings, including trends in credit card fraud, observations about cryptocurrency, AI developments and how they're lowering barriers to entry to cybercrime, and the rise of cybercriminal "as-a-service" activities. Further below, I also discuss the need for a new security approach, combining attack surface management (ASM) and cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Thursday unveiled charges against a Russian national for his alleged involvement in deploying LockBit ransomware to targets in the U.S., Asia, Europe, and Africa. Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov, 20, of Chechen Republic has been accused of perpetrating at least five attacks between August 2020 and March 2023. He was arrested in the state of Arizona last month. "Astamirov allegedly participated in a conspiracy with other members of the LockBit ransomware campaign to commit wire fraud and to intentionally damage protected computers and make ransom demands through the use and deployment of ransomware," the DoJ  said . Astamirov, as part of his LockBit-related activities, managed various email addresses, IP addresses, and other online accounts to deploy the ransomware and communicate with the victims. Law enforcement agencies said they were able to trace a chunk of an unnamed victim's ransom payment to a virtual currency address operated by Astam

Third Flaw Uncovered in MOVEit Transfer App Amidst Cl0p Ransomware Mass Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/third-flaw-uncovered-in-moveit-transfer.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Progress Software on Thursday  disclosed  a third vulnerability impacting its MOVEit Transfer application, as the Cl0p cybercrime gang deployed extortion tactics against affected companies. The  new flaw , which is being tracked as CVE-2023-35708 , also concerns an SQL injection vulnerability that "could lead to escalated privileges and potential unauthorized access to the environment." The company is urging its customers to disable all HTTP and HTTPs traffic to MOVEit Transfer on ports 80 and 443 to safeguard their environments while a fix is being prepared to address the weakness. The cloud managed file transfer solution has been fully patched. The revelation comes a week after Progress  divulged  another set of SQL injection vulnerabilities ( CVE-2023-35036 ) that it said could be weaponized to access the application's database content. The vulnerabilities join  CVE-2023-34362 , which was  exploited  as a zero-day by the Clop ransomware gang in data theft attacks

Ransomware actors and cryptocurrency scammers have joined nation-state actors in abusing cloud mining services to launder digital assets, new findings reveal. "Cryptocurrency mining is a crucial part of our industry, but it also holds special appeal to bad actors, as it provides a means to acquire money with a totally clean on-chain original source," blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. Earlier this March, Google Mandiant  disclosed  North Korea-based APT43's use of the hash rental and cloud mining services to obscure the forensic trail and wash the stolen cryptocurrency "clean." Cloud mining services  allow users to rent a computer system and use that computer's hash power to mine cryptocurrencies without having to manage the mining hardware themselves. But according to Chainalysis, it's not just nation-state hacking crews who are leveraging such services in the wild. In one example highlighted by

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected China-nexus threat actor dubbed UNC4841 has been linked to the exploitation of a recently patched zero-day flaw in Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances since October 2022. "UNC4841 is an espionage actor behind this wide-ranging campaign in support of the People's Republic of China," Google-owned Mandiant said in a new report published today, describing the group as "aggressive and skilled." The flaw in question is CVE-2023-2868 (CVSS score: 9.8), which relates to a remote code injection affecting versions 5.1.3.001 through 9.2.0.006 that arises as a result of an incomplete validation of attachments contained within incoming emails. Barracuda addressed the problem on May 20 and 21, 2023, but the company has since urged affected customers to immediately replace the devices "regardless of patch version level." Now according to the incident response and threat intelligence firm, which was appointed to probe the hack, UNC4

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's a new kind of software supply chain attack aimed at open source projects, it has emerged that threat actors could seize control of expired Amazon S3 buckets to serve rogue binaries without altering the modules themselves. "Malicious binaries steal the user IDs, passwords, local machine environment variables, and local host name, and then exfiltrates the stolen data to the hijacked bucket," Checkmarx researcher Guy Nachshon said. The attack was first observed in the case of an npm package called  bignum , which, until version 0.13.0, relied on an Amazon S3 bucket to download pre-built binary versions of an addon named node-pre-gyp during installation. "These binaries were published on a now-expired S3 bucket which has since been claimed by a malicious third party which is now serving binaries containing malware that exfiltrates data from the user's computer," according to a  GitHub advisory  published on May 24, 2023.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two "dangerous" security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Microsoft Azure Bastion and Azure Container Registry that could have been exploited to carry out cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. "The vulnerabilities allowed unauthorized access to the victim's session within the compromised Azure service iframe, which can lead to severe consequences, including unauthorized data access, unauthorized modifications, and disruption of the Azure services iframes," Orca security researcher Lidor Ben Shitrit  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. XSS attacks  take place when threat actors inject arbitrary code into an otherwise trusted website, which then gets executed every time when unsuspecting users visit the site. The two flaws identified by Orca leverage a weakness in the postMessage iframe, which enables cross-origin communication between Window objects. This meant that the shortcoming could be abused to embed endpoints within remote servers usin

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Golang-based information stealer called  Skuld  has compromised Windows systems across Europe, Southeast Asia, and the U.S. "This new malware strain tries to steal sensitive information from its victims," Trellix researcher Ernesto Fernández Provecho  said  in a Tuesday analysis. "To accomplish this task, it searches for data stored in applications such as Discord and web browsers; information from the system and files stored in the victim's folders." Skuld, which shares overlaps with publicly available stealers like  Creal Stealer ,  Luna Grabber , and  BlackCap Grabber , is the handiwork of a developer who goes by the online alias Deathined on various social media platforms like GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, and Tumblr. Also spotted by Trellix is a Telegram group named deathinews, indicating that these online avenues could be used to promote the offering in the future as a service for other threat actors.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For the better part of the 90s and early aughts, the sysadmin handbook said, " Filter your incoming traffic, not everyone is nice out there " (later coined by Gandalf as " You shall not pass "). So CIOs started to supercharge their network fences with every appliance they could get to protect against inbound (aka INGRESS) traffic. In the wake of the first mass phishing campaigns in the early 2010s, it became increasingly obvious that someone had to deal with the employees and, more and specifically, their stunning capacity to click on every link they'd receive. Outbound traffic filtering (aka EGRESS) became an obsession. Browser security, proxies, and other glorified antiviruses became the must-have every consulting firm would advise their clients to get their hands on ASAP. The risk was real, and the response was fairly adapted, but it also contributed to the famous " super soldier " stance. I'm alone against an army? So be it, I'll dig a t

At least half of dozen GitHub accounts from fake researchers associated with a fraudulent cybersecurity company have been observed pushing malicious repositories on the code hosting service. All seven repositories, which are still available as of writing, claim to be a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for purported zero-day flaws in Discord, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Exchange Server. VulnCheck, which discovered the activity,  said , "the individuals creating these repositories have put significant effort into making them look legitimate by creating a network of accounts and Twitter profiles, pretending to be part of a non-existent company called High Sierra Cyber Security." The cybersecurity firm said it first came across the rogue repositories in early May when they were observed releasing similar PoC exploits for zero-day bugs in Signal and WhatsApp. The two repositories have since been taken down.

Critical Security Vulnerability Discovered in WooCommerce Stripe Gateway Plugin<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/critical-security-vulnerability.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security flaw has been uncovered in the WooCommerce Stripe Gateway WordPress plugin that could lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. The flaw, tracked as  CVE-2023-34000 , impacts versions 7.4.0 and below. It was addressed by the plugin maintainers in version 7.4.1, which shipped on May 30, 2023. WooCommerce Stripe Gateway  allows  e-commerce websites to directly accept various payment methods through Stripe's payment processing API. It boasts of over 900,000 active installations. According to Patch security researcher Rafie Muhammad, the plugin suffers from what's called an unauthenticated Insecure direct object references ( IDOR ) vulnerability, which allows a bad actor to bypass authorization and access resources. Specially, the problem stems from the insecure handling of order objects and a lack of adequate access control mechanism in the plugin's 'javascript_params' and 'payment_fields' functions of the plugin.

Microsoft has rolled out fixes for its Windows operating system and other software components to remediate major security shortcomings as part of  Patch Tuesday updates  for June 2023. Of the 73 flaws, six are rated Critical, 63 are rated Important, two are rated Moderate, and one is rated Low in severity. This also includes three issues the tech giant addressed in its Chromium-based Edge browser. It's worth noting that Microsoft also closed out  26 other flaws  in Edge – all of them rooted in Chromium itself – since the release of May Patch Tuesday updates. This comprises  CVE-2023-3079 , a zero-day bug that Google disclosed as being actively exploited in the wild last week. The June 2023 updates also mark the first time in several months that doesn't feature any zero-day flaw in Microsoft products that's publicly known or under active attack at the time of release. Topping the list of fixes is  CVE-2023-29357  (CVSS score: 9.8), a privilege escalation flaw in ShareP

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A novel multi-stage loader called  DoubleFinger  has been observed delivering a cryptocurrency stealer dubbed GreetingGhoul in what's an advanced attack targeting users in Europe, the U.S., and Latin America. "DoubleFinger is deployed on the target machine, when the victim opens a malicious PIF attachment in an email message, ultimately executing the first of DoubleFinger's loader stages," Kaspersky researcher Sergey Lozhkin  said  in a Monday report. The starting point of the attacks is a modified version of  espexe.exe  – which refers to Microsoft Windows Economical Service Provider application – that's engineered to execute shellcode responsible for retrieving a PNG image file from the image hosting service Imgur. The image employs steganographic trickery to conceal an encrypted payload that triggers a four-stage compromise chain which eventually culminates in the execution of the GreetingGhoul stealer on the infected host.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
It might come as a surprise, but secrets management has become the elephant in the AppSec room. While security vulnerabilities like Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) often make headlines in the cybersecurity world, secrets management remains an overlooked issue that can have immediate and impactful consequences for corporate safety.  A recent study by GitGuardian found that 75% of IT decision-makers in the US and the UK reported at least one secret leaked from an application, with 60% causing issues for the company or employees. Shockingly, less than half of respondents (48%) were confident in their ability to protect application secrets "to a great extent." The study, named  Voice of Practitioners: The State of Secrets in AppSec  (available for free download  here ), provides a fresh perspective on managing secrets, which is often reduced to clichés that do not reflect the operational reality in engineering departments.  Despite their ubiquity in modern cloud a

"Dozens" of organizations across the world have been targeted as part of a broad business email compromise ( BEC ) campaign that involved the use of adversary-in-the-middle ( AitM ) techniques to carry out the attacks. "Following a successful phishing attempt, the threat actor gained initial access to one of the victim employee's account and executed an 'adversary-in-the-middle' attack to bypass Office365 authentication and gain persistence access to that account," Sygnia researchers  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Once gaining persistence, the threat actor exfiltrated data from the compromised account and used his access to spread the phishing attacks against other victim's employees along with several external targeted organizations." The findings come less than a week after Microsoft  detailed  a similar combination of an AitM phishing and a BEC attack aimed at banking and financial services organizations. BEC scam

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Believe it or not, your attack surface is expanding faster than you realize. How? APIs, of course! More formally known as application programming interfaces, API calls are growing twice as fast as HTML traffic, making APIs an ideal candidate for new security solutions aimed at protecting customer data, according to Cloudflare. According to the "Quantifying the Cost of API Insecurity" report, US businesses incurred upwards of $23 billion in losses from API-related breaches in 2022. In fact, 76% of cybersecurity professionals admitted to experiencing an API-related security incident. This is why you can't afford to ignore your API security posture , especially when you consider that APIs don't exist in a vacuum. The infrastructure components powering those critical APIs can suffer from security misconfigurations as well, leaving you open to unexpected breaches. However, this isn't something you or your AppSec teams can take on alone, both in terms of volume and

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has charged two Russian nationals in connection with masterminding the 2014 digital heist of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox. According to unsealed indictments released last week, Alexey Bilyuchenko, 43, and Aleksandr Verner, 29, have been accused of conspiring to launder approximately 647,000 bitcoins stolen from September 2011 through at least May 2014 as a result of unauthorized access to a server holding crypto wallets used by Mt. Gox customers. "Starting in 2011, Bilyuchenko and Verner stole a massive amount of cryptocurrency from Mt. Gox, contributing to the exchange's ultimate insolvency," Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr.  said  in a statement. "Armed with the ill-gotten gains from Mt. Gox, Bilyuchenko allegedly went on to help set up the notorious  BTC-e virtual currency exchange , which laundered funds for cyber criminals worldwide." Bilyuchenko and Verner are also alleged to hav

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have warned about an "easily exploitable" flaw in the Microsoft Visual Studio installer that could be abused by a malicious actor to impersonate a legitimate publisher and distribute malicious extensions. "A threat actor could impersonate a popular publisher and issue a malicious extension to compromise a targeted system," Varonis researcher Dolev Taler  said . "Malicious extensions have been used to steal sensitive information, silently access and change code, or take full control of a system." The vulnerability, which is tracked as  CVE-2023-28299  (CVSS score: 5.5), was addressed by Microsoft as part of its  Patch Tuesday updates  for April 2023, describing it as a spoofing flaw. The bug discovered by Varonis has to do with the Visual Studio user interface, which allows for spoofed publisher digital signatures. Specifically, it trivially bypasses a restriction that prevents users from entering information in the "product

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The term " attack surface management " (ASM) went from unknown to ubiquitous in the cybersecurity space over the past few years. Gartner and Forrester have both highlighted the  importance of ASM  recently, multiple solution providers have emerged in the space, and investment and acquisition activity have seen an uptick. Many concepts come and go in cybersecurity, but attack surface management promises to have staying power. As it evolves into a critical component of threat and exposure management strategies, it's worth examining why attack surface management has grown to become a key category, and why it will continue to be a necessity for organizations worldwide. What is Attack Surface Management?  Attack surfaces are rapidly expanding. The attack surface includes any IT asset connected to the internet – applications, IoT devices, Kubernetes clusters, cloud platforms – that threat actors could infiltrate and exploit to perpetuate an attack.

Cybercriminals Using Powerful BatCloak Engine to Make Malware Fully Undetectable<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/cybercriminals-using-powerful-batcloak.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A fully undetectable (FUD) malware obfuscation engine named  BatCloak  is being used to deploy various malware strains since September 2022, while persistently evading antivirus detection. The samples grant "threat actors the ability to load numerous malware families and exploits with ease through highly obfuscated batch files," Trend Micro researchers  said . About 79.6% of the total 784 artifacts unearthed have no detection across all security solutions, the cybersecurity firm added, highlighting BatCloak's ability to circumvent traditional detection mechanisms. The BatCloak engine forms the crux of an off-the-shelf batch file builder tool called Jlaive, which comes with capabilities to bypass Antimalware Scan Interface ( AMSI ) as well as compress and encrypt the primary payload to achieve heightened security evasion. The open-source tool, although taken down since it was made available via GitHub and GitLab in September 2022 by a developer named ch2sh, has been

Password Reset Hack Exposed in Honda's E-Commerce Platform, Dealers Data at Risk<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/password-reset-hack-exposed-in-hondas-e.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security vulnerabilities discovered in Honda's e-commerce platform could have been exploited to gain unrestricted access to sensitive dealer information. "Broken/missing access controls made it possible to access all data on the platform, even when logged in as a test account," security researcher Eaton Zveare  said  in a report published last week. The  platform  is designed for the sale of power equipment, marine, lawn and garden businesses. It does not impact the Japanese company's automobile division. The hack, in a nutshell, exploits a password reset mechanism on one of Honda's sites, Power Equipment Tech Express (PETE), to reset the password associated with any account and obtain full admin-level access. This is made possible due to the fact that the API allows any user to send a password reset request simply by just knowing the username or email address and without having to enter a password tied to that account. Armed with this capability, a malicio

Beware: 1,000+ Fake Cryptocurrency Sites Trap Users in Bogus Rewards Scheme<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/beware-1000-fake-cryptocurrency-sites.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undetected cryptocurrency scam has leveraged a constellation of over 1,000 fraudulent websites to ensnare users into a bogus rewards scheme since at least January 2021. "This massive campaign has likely resulted in thousands of people being scammed worldwide," Trend Micro researchers  said  in a report published last week, linking it to a Russian-speaking threat actor named "Impulse Team." "The scam works via an advanced fee fraud that involves tricking victims into believing that they've won a certain amount of cryptocurrency. However, to get their rewards, the victims would need to pay a small amount to open an account on their website." The compromise chain starts with a direct message propagated via Twitter to lure potential targets into visiting the decoy site. The account responsible for sending the messages has since been closed. The message urges recipients to sign up for an account on the website and apply a promo code specif

Critical RCE Flaw Discovered in Fortinet FortiGate Firewalls - Patch Now!<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/critical-rce-flaw-discovered-in.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Fortinet has released patches to address a critical security flaw in its FortiGate firewalls that could be abused by a threat actor to achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2023-27997 , is "reachable pre-authentication, on every SSL VPN appliance," Lexfo Security researcher Charles Fol, who discovered and reported the flaw alongside Dany Bach,  said  in a tweet over the weekend. Details about the security flaw are currently withheld and Fortinet is yet to release an advisory, although the network security company is expected to publish more details in the coming days. French cybersecurity company Olympe Cyberdefense, in an independent alert,  said  the issue has been patched in versions 6.2.15, 6.4.13, 7.0.12, and 7.2.5. "The flaw would allow a hostile agent to interfere via the VPN, even if the MFA is activated," the firm noted. With Fortinet flaws  emerging  as a  lucrative   attack vector  for threat actors in recent years, it&#

Apple's Safari Private Browsing Now Automatically Removes Tracking Parameters in URLs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/apples-safari-private-browsing-now.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple is introducing major updates to  Safari Private Browsing , offering users better protections against third-party trackers as they browse the web. "Advanced tracking and fingerprinting protections go even further to help prevent websites from using the latest techniques to track or identify a user's device," the iPhone maker  said . "Private Browsing now locks when not in use, allowing a user to keep tabs open even when stepping away from the device." The privacy improvements were previewed at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) last week. They are expected to be rolled out to users as part of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma later this year. Another key change includes Link Tracking Protection in Mail, Messages, and Safari's private mode to automatically remove  tracking parameters  in URLs, which are often used to track information about a click. "Safari has been a somewhat unheralded pioneer of private browsing, a

New SPECTRALVIPER Backdoor Targeting Vietnamese Public Companies<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-spectralviper-backdoor-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Vietnamese public companies have been targeted as part of an ongoing campaign that deploys a novel backdoor called  SPECTRALVIPER . "SPECTRALVIPER is a heavily obfuscated, previously undisclosed, x64 backdoor that brings PE loading and injection, file upload and download, file and directory manipulation, and token impersonation capabilities," Elastic Security Labs  said  in a Friday report. The attacks have been attributed to an actor it tracks as REF2754, which overlaps with a Vietnamese threat group known as APT32, Canvas Cyclone (formerly Bismuth), Cobalt Kitty, and OceanLotus. Meta, in December 2020,  linked the activities  of the hacking crew to a cybersecurity company named CyberOne Group. In the latest infection flow unearthed by Elastic, the SysInternals  ProcDump  utility is leveraged to load an unsigned DLL file that contains DONUTLOADER, which, in turn, is configured to load SPECTRALVIPER and other malware such as P8LOADER or POWERSEAL. SPECTRALVIPER is desi

Progress Software, the company behind the MOVEit Transfer application, has released patches to address brand new SQL injection vulnerabilities affecting the file transfer solution that could enable the theft of sensitive information. "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities have been identified in the MOVEit Transfer web application that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to the MOVEit Transfer database," the company  said  in an advisory released on June 9, 2023. "An attacker could submit a crafted payload to a MOVEit Transfer application endpoint which could result in modification and disclosure of MOVEit database content."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Banking and financial services organizations are the targets of a new multi-stage adversary-in-the-middle ( AitM ) phishing and business email compromise (BEC) attack, Microsoft has revealed. "The attack originated from a compromised trusted vendor and transitioned into a series of AiTM attacks and follow-on BEC activity spanning multiple organizations," the tech giant  disclosed  in a Thursday report. Microsoft, which is tracking the cluster under its emerging moniker  Storm-1167 , called out the group's use of indirect proxy to pull off the attack. This enabled the attackers to flexibly tailor the phishing pages to their targets and carry out session cookie theft, underscoring the continued sophistication of AitM attacks. The modus operandi is unlike other AitM campaigns where the decoy pages act as a  reverse proxy  to harvest credentials and time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) entered by the victims.

The threat actor known as  Asylum Ambuscade  has been observed straddling cybercrime and cyber espionage operations since at least early 2020. "It is a crimeware group that targets bank customers and cryptocurrency traders in various regions, including North America and Europe," ESET  said  in an analysis published Thursday. "Asylum Ambuscade also does espionage against government entities in Europe and Central Asia." Asylum Ambuscade was  first documented  by Proofpoint in March 2022 as a nation-state-sponsored phishing campaign that targeted European governmental entities in an attempt to obtain intelligence on refugee and supply movement in the region. The goal of the attackers, per the Slovak cybersecurity firm, is to siphon confidential information and web email credentials from official government email portals.

The way we work has undergone a dramatic transformation in recent years. We now operate within digital ecosystems, where remote work and the reliance on a multitude of digital tools is the norm rather than the exception. This shift – as you likely know from your own life – has led to superhuman levels of productivity that we wouldn't ever want to give up. But moving fast comes at a cost. And for our digital work environment, that cost is security.  Our desire for innovation, speed and efficiency has birthed new and complex security challenges that all in some way or another revolve around securing how we access resources. Because of this, effective access management now plays a more critical role in securing the modern workplace than ever. Follow along as we uncover five reasons why this is the case.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new custom backdoor dubbed  Stealth Soldier  has been deployed as part of a set of highly-targeted espionage attacks in North Africa. "Stealth Soldier malware is an undocumented backdoor that primarily operates surveillance functions such as file exfiltration, screen and microphone recording, keystroke logging and stealing browser information," cybersecurity company Check Point  said  in a technical report. The ongoing operation is characterized by the use of command-and-control (C&C) servers that mimic sites belonging to the Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The earliest artifacts associated with the campaign date back to October 2022. The attacks commence with potential targets downloading bogus downloader binaries that are delivered via social engineering attacks and act as a conduit for retrieving Stealth Soldier, while simultaneously displaying a decoy empty PDF file.

Details have emerged about a now-patched actively exploited security flaw in Microsoft Windows that could be abused by a threat actor to gain elevated privileges on affected systems. The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2023-29336 , is rated 7.8 for severity and concerns an elevation of privilege bug in the Win32k component. "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain SYSTEM privileges," Microsoft  disclosed  in an advisory issued last month as part of Patch Tuesday updates. Avast researchers Jan Vojtěšek, Milánek, and Luigino Camastra were credited with discovering and reporting the flaw. Win32k.sys is a kernel-mode driver and an integral part of the Windows architecture, being responsible for graphical device interface (GUI) and window management. While the exact specifics surrounding in-the-wild abuse of the flaw is presently not known, Numen Cyber has deconstructed the patch released by Microsoft to craft a proof-of-concept ( PoC ) exploit

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have published a joint advisory regarding the active exploitation of a  recently disclosed critical flaw  in Progress Software's MOVEit Transfer application to drop ransomware. "The Cl0p Ransomware Gang, also known as TA505, reportedly began exploiting a previously unknown SQL injection vulnerability in Progress Software's managed file transfer (MFT) solution known as MOVEit Transfer," the agencies  said . "Internet-facing MOVEit Transfer web applications were infected with a web shell named LEMURLOOT, which was then used to steal data from underlying MOVEit Transfer databases." The prolific cybercrime gang has since  issued an ultimatum  to several impacted businesses, urging them to get in touch by June 14, 2023, or risk getting all their stolen data published. Microsoft is tracking the activity under the moniker  Lace Tempest  (aka Storm-0950),

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
APIs, more formally known as application programming interfaces, empower apps and microservices to communicate and share data. However, this level of connectivity doesn't come without major risks. Hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in APIs to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or even take control of the entire system. Therefore, it's essential to have a robust API security posture to protect your organization from potential threats. What is API posture management? API posture management refers to the process of monitoring and managing the security posture of your APIs. It involves identifying potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers, and taking the necessary steps to remediate them. Posture management also helps organizations classify sensitive data and ensure that it's compliant with the leading data compliance regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.  As mentioned above, APIs are a popular target for attackers

The North Korean nation-state threat actor known as  Kimsuky  has been linked to a social engineering campaign targeting experts in North Korean affairs with the goal of stealing Google credentials and delivering reconnaissance malware. "Further, Kimsuky's objective extends to the theft of subscription credentials from NK News," cybersecurity firm SentinelOne  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "To achieve this, the group distributes emails that lure targeted individuals to log in on the malicious website nknews[.]pro, which masquerades as the authentic NK News site. The login form that is presented to the target is designed to capture entered credentials." NK News , established in 2011, is an American subscription-based news website that provides stories and analysis about North Korea. The disclosure comes days after U.S. and South Korean intelligence agencies  issued an alert  warning of Kimsuky's use of social engineering tactics to strik

Microsoft has agreed to pay a penalty of $20 million to settle U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charges that the company illegally collected and retained the data of children who signed up to use its Xbox video game console without their parents' knowledge or consent. "Our proposed order makes it easier for parents to protect their children's privacy on Xbox, and limits what information Microsoft can collect and retain about kids," FTC's Samuel Levine  said . "This action should also make it abundantly clear that kids' avatars, biometric data, and health information are not exempt from  COPPA ." As part of the proposed settlement, which is pending court approval, Redmond has been ordered to update its account creation process for children to prevent the collection and storage of data, including obtaining parental consent and deleting said information within two weeks if approval is not obtained.

Get exclusive insights from a real ransomware negotiator who shares authentic stories from network hostage situations and how he managed them. The Ransomware Industry Ransomware is an industry. As such, it has its own business logic: organizations pay money, in crypto-currency, in order to regain control over their systems and data. This industry's landscape is made up of approximately 10-20 core threat actors who originally developed the ransomware's malware. To distribute the malware, they work with affiliates and distributors who utilize widespread  phishing attacks  to breach organizations. Profits are distributed with approximately 70% allocated to the affiliates and 10%-30% to these developers. The use of phishing renders online-based industries, like gaming, finance and insurance, especially vulnerable.  In addition to its financial motivations, the ransomware industry is also influenced by geo-political politics.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been observed targeting the U.S. aerospace industry with a new PowerShell-based malware called PowerDrop . "PowerDrop uses advanced techniques to evade detection such as deception, encoding, and encryption," according to Adlumin, which  found the malware  implanted in an unnamed domestic aerospace defense contractor in May 2023. "The name is derived from the tool, Windows PowerShell, used to concoct the script, and 'Drop' from the DROP (DRP) string used in the code for padding." PowerDrop is also a post-exploitation tool, meaning it's designed to gather information from victim networks after obtaining initial access through other means. The malware employs Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request messages as beacons to initiate communications with a command-and-control (C2) server. The server, for its part, responds back with an encrypted command that's decoded and run on the compromised host. A similar

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recent malware campaign has been found to leverage  Satacom downloader  as a conduit to deploy stealthy malware capable of siphoning cryptocurrency using a rogue extension for Chromium-based browsers. "The main purpose of the malware that is dropped by the Satacom downloader is to steal BTC from the victim's account by performing web injections into targeted cryptocurrency websites," Kaspersky researchers Haim Zigel and Oleg Kupreev  said . Targets of the campaign include Coinbase, Bybit, KuCoin, Huobi, and Binance users primarily located in Brazil, Algeria, Turkey, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Egypt, and Mexico. Satacom downloader, also called  Legion Loader , first emerged in 2019 as a dropper for next-stage payloads, including information stealers and cryptocurrency miners. Infection chains involving the malware begin when users searching for cracked software are redirected to bogus websites that host ZIP archive files containing the malware. "Various types

Thousands of adware apps for Android have been found to masquerade as cracks or modded versions of popular apps to redirect users to serve unwanted ads to users as part of a campaign ongoing since October 2022. "The campaign is designed to aggressively push adware to Android devices with the purpose to drive revenue," Bitdefender said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. "However, the threat actors involved can easily switch tactics to  redirect users to other types of malware such as banking Trojans to steal credentials and financial information or ransomware." The Romanian cybersecurity company said it has discovered 60,000 unique apps carrying the adware, with a majority of the detections located in the U.S., South Korea, Brazil, Germany, the U.K., France, Kazakhstan, Romania, and Italy. It's worth pointing out that none of the apps are distributed through the official Google Play Store. Instead, users searching for apps like Netflix, PDF

Attacks on critical infrastructure and other OT systems are on the rise as digital transformation and OT/IT convergence continue to accelerate. Water treatment facilities, energy providers, factories, and chemical plants — the infrastructure that undergirds our daily lives could all be at risk. Disrupting or manipulating OT systems stands to pose real physical harm to citizens, environments, and economies. Yet the landscape of OT security tools is far less developed than its information technology (IT) counterpart. According to a recent  report from Takepoint Research and Cyolo , there is a notable lack of confidence in the tools commonly used to secure remote access to industrial environments.  Figure 1: New research reveals a large gap across industries between the level of concern about security risks and the level of confidence in existing solutions for industrial secure remote access (I-SRA).

Google on Monday released security updates to patch a high-severity flaw in its Chrome web browser that it said is being actively exploited in the wild. Tracked as  CVE-2023-3079 , the vulnerability has been described as a type confusion bug in the V8 JavaScript engine. Clement Lecigne of Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been credited with reporting the issue on June 1, 2023. "Type confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 114.0.5735.110 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page,"  according  to the NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The tech giant, as is typically the case, did not disclose details of the nature of the attacks, but  noted  it's "aware that an exploit for CVE-2023-3079 exists in the wild." With the latest development, Google has addressed a total of three actively exploited zero-days in Chrome since the start of the year - CVE-2023-2033  (CVSS score: 8.8) - Type Co

Threat actors associated with the  Cyclops ransomware  have been observed offering an information stealer malware that's designed to capture sensitive data from infected hosts. "The threat actor behind this [ransomware-as-a-service] promotes its offering on forums," Uptycs  said  in a new report. "There it requests a share of profits from those engaging in malicious activities using its malware." Cyclops ransomware is notable for targeting all major desktop operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. It's also designed to terminate any potential processes that could interfere with encryption. The macOS and Linux versions of Cyclops ransomware are written in Golang. The ransomware further employs a complex encryption scheme that's a mix of asymmetric and symmetric encryption. The Go-based stealer, for its part, is designed to target Windows and Linux systems, capturing details such as operating system information, computer name, number o

Chinese PostalFurious Gang Strikes UAE Users with Sneaky SMS Phishing Scheme<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/chinese-postalfurious-gang-strikes-uae.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese-speaking phishing gang dubbed  PostalFurious  has been linked to a new SMS campaign that's targeting users in the U.A.E. by masquerading as postal services and toll operators, per Group-IB. The fraudulent scheme entails sending users bogus text messages asking them to pay a vehicle trip fee to avoid additional fines. The messages also contain a shortened URL to conceal the actual phishing link. Clicking on the link directs the unsuspecting recipients to a fake landing page that's designed to capture payment credentials and personal data. The campaign is estimated to be active as of April 15, 2023. "The URLs from the texts lead to fake branded payment pages that ask for personal details, such as name, address, and credit card information," Group-IB  said . "The phishing pages appropriate the official name and logo of the impersonated postal service provider." The exact scale of the attacks is currently unknown. What's known is that the tex

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has officially linked the  ongoing active exploitation  of a critical flaw in the Progress Software MOVEit Transfer application to a threat actor it tracks as  Lace Tempest . "Exploitation is often followed by deployment of a web shell with data exfiltration capabilities," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team  said  in a series of tweets today. "CVE-2023-34362 allows attackers to authenticate as any user." Lace Tempest, also called Storm-0950, is a ransomware affiliate that overlaps with other groups such as FIN11, TA505, and Evil Corp. It's also known to operate the Cl0p extortion site.  The threat actor also has a track record of exploiting different zero-day flaws to siphon data and extort victims, with the group recently observed weaponizing a  severe bug in PaperCut servers . CVE-2023-34362 relates to an SQL injection vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer that enables unauthenticated, remote attackers to gain access to the database and execute

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a new ongoing  Magecart -style web skimmer campaign that's designed to steal personally identifiable information (PII) and credit card data from e-commerce websites. A noteworthy aspect that sets it apart from other Magecart campaigns is that the hijacked sites further serve as "makeshift" command-and-control (C2) servers, using the cover to facilitate the distribution of malicious code without the knowledge of the victim sites. Web security company Akamai said it identified victims of varying sizes in North America, Latin America, and Europe, potentially putting the personal data of thousands of site visitors at risk of being harvested and sold for illicit profits. "Attackers employ a number of evasion techniques during the campaign, including obfuscating [using] Base64 and masking the attack to resemble popular third-party services, such as Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager," Akamai security researcher Roman Lv

An unknown cybercrime threat actor has been observed targeting Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking victims to compromise online banking accounts in Mexico, Peru, and Portugal. "This threat actor employs tactics such as LOLBaS (living-off-the-land binaries and scripts), along with CMD-based scripts to carry out its malicious activities," the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team  said  in a report published last week. The cybersecurity company attributed the campaign, dubbed Operation CMDStealer , to a Brazilian threat actor based on an analysis of the artifacts. The attack chain primarily leverages social engineering, banking on Portuguese and Spanish emails containing tax- or traffic violation-themed lures to trigger the infections and gain unauthorized access to victims' systems. The emails come fitted with an HTML attachment that contains obfuscated code to fetch the next-stage payload from a remote server in the form of a RAR archive file. The files, which are

A surge in TrueBot activity was observed in May 2023, cybersecurity researchers disclosed. "TrueBot is a downloader trojan botnet that uses command and control servers to collect information on compromised systems and uses that compromised system as a launching point for further attacks," VMware's Fae Carlisle  said . Active since at least 2017, TrueBot is linked to a group known as Silence that's believed to share overlaps with the notorious Russian cybercrime actor known as  Evil Corp . Recent  TrueBot infections  have leveraged a critical flaw in Netwrix auditor ( CVE-2022-31199 , CVSS score: 9.8) as well as  Raspberry Robin  as delivery vectors. The attack chain documented by VMware, on the other hand, starts off with a drive-by-download of an executable named " update.exe " from Google Chrome, suggesting that users are lured into downloading the malware under the pretext of a software update.

New Linux Ransomware Strain BlackSuit Shows Striking Similarities to Royal<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-linux-ransomware-strain-blacksuit.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of the Linux variant of a new ransomware strain called BlackSuit has covered significant similarities with another ransomware family called  Royal . Trend Micro, which examined an x64 VMware ESXi version targeting Linux machines, said it identified an "extremely high degree of similarity" between Royal and BlackSuit. "In fact, they're nearly identical, with 98% similarities in functions, 99.5% similarities in blocks, and 98.9% similarities in jumps based on BinDiff, a comparison tool for binary files," Trend Micro researchers  noted . A comparison of the Windows artifacts has identified 93.2% similarity in functions, 99.3% in basic blocks, and 98.4% in jumps based on BinDiff. BlackSuit  first came to light  in early  May 2023  when Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 drew attention to its ability to target both Windows and Linux hosts. In line with other ransomware groups, it runs a double extortion scheme that steals and encrypts sensitive data in a c

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A survey of global cybersecurity leaders through the 2023 Certified CISO Hall of Fame Report commissioned by the EC-Council identified 4 primary areas of grave concern: cloud security, data security, security governance, and lack of cybersecurity talent. EC-Council, the global leader in cybersecurity education and training, released its Certified Chief Information Security Officer Hall of Fame Report today, honoring the top 50 Certified CISOs globally. This report reveals that approximately 50% of surveyed information security leaders identified cloud security as their top concern. Findings from the report suggest the top cybersecurity concerns with which organizations struggle and highlight the need for implementing robust security frameworks with skilled cybersecurity professionals to effectively contain emerging threats. On average, an enterprise uses approximately 1,295 cloud services, while an employee uses at least 36 cloud-based services daily. Cloud security risk is real for

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has fined Amazon a cumulative $30.8 million over a series of privacy lapses regarding its Alexa assistant and Ring security cameras. This comprises a $25 million penalty for breaching children's privacy laws by retaining their Alexa voice recordings for indefinite time periods and preventing parents from exercising their deletion rights. "Amazon's history of misleading parents, keeping children's recordings indefinitely, and flouting parents' deletion requests violated  COPPA  and sacrificed privacy for profits," FTC's Samuel Levine said. As part of the court order, the retail giant has been mandated to delete the collected information, including inactive child accounts, geolocation data, and voice recordings, and prohibited from gathering such data to train its algorithms. It's also required to disclose to customers its data retention practices. Amazon has also agreed to fork out an additional $5.8 million

New Botnet Malware 'Horabot' Targets Spanish-Speaking Users in Latin America<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-botnet-malware-horabot-targets.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Spanish-speaking users in Latin America have been at the receiving end of a new botnet malware dubbed  Horabot  since at least November 2020. "Horabot enables the threat actor to control the victim's Outlook mailbox, exfiltrate contacts' email addresses, and send phishing emails with malicious HTML attachments to all addresses in the victim's mailbox," Cisco Talos researcher Chetan Raghuprasad  said . The botnet program also delivers a Windows-based financial trojan and a spam tool to harvest online banking credentials as well as compromise Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo! webmail accounts to blast spam emails. The cybersecurity firm said a majority of the infections are located in Mexico, with limited victims identified in Uruguay, Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, Guatemala, and Panama. The threat actor behind the campaign is believed to be in Brazil. Targeted users of the ongoing campaign primarily span accounting, construction and engineering, wholesale distributio

Data security is reinventing itself. As new data security posture management solutions come to market, organizations are increasingly recognizing the opportunity to provide evidence-based security that proves how their data is being protected. But what exactly is data security posture, and how do you manage it?  Data security posture management  (DSPM) became mainstream following the publication of Gartner® Cool Vendors™ in Data Security—Secure and Accelerate Advanced Use Cases. In that  report , Gartner1 seems to have kicked off the popular use of the data security posture management term and massive investment in this space by every VC. Since that report, Gartner has identified at least 16 DSPM vendors, including Symmetry Systems. What is Data Security Posture? There certainly is a lot being marketed and published about data security posture management solutions themselves, but we first wanted to dig into what is data security posture?  Symmetry Systems defines data security pos

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Chinese nation-state group known as  Camaro Dragon  has been linked to yet another backdoor that's designed to meet its intelligence-gathering goals. Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point, which  dubbed  the Go-based malware TinyNote, said it functions as a first-stage payload capable of "basic machine enumeration and command execution via PowerShell or Goroutines." What the malware lacks in terms of sophistication, it makes up for it when it comes to establishing redundant methods to retain access to the compromised host by means of multiple persistency tasks and varied methods to communicate with different servers. Camaro Dragon overlaps with a threat actor widely tracked as Mustang Panda, a state-sponsored group from China that is known to be active since at least 2012. The adversarial collective was recently in the spotlight for a custom bespoke firmware implant called  Horse Shell  that co-opts TP-Link routers into a mesh network capable of transmitting co

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. and South Korean intelligence agencies have issued a new alert warning of North Korean cyber actors' use of social engineering tactics to strike think tanks, academia, and news media sectors. The "sustained information gathering efforts" have been attributed to a state-sponsored cluster dubbed  Kimsuky , which is also known by the names APT43, ARCHIPELAGO, Black Banshee, Emerald Sleet (previously Thallium), Nickel Kimball, and Velvet Chollima. "North Korea relies heavily on intelligence gained from these spear-phishing campaigns," the agencies  said . "Successful compromises of the targeted individuals enable Kimsuky actors to craft more credible and effective spear-phishing emails that can be leveraged against sensitive, high-value targets." Kimsuky refers to an ancillary element within North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) and is known to collect tactical intelligence on geopolitical events and negotiations affecting the regi

A critical flaw in Progress Software's in MOVEit Transfer managed file transfer application has come under widespread exploitation in the wild to take over vulnerable systems. The shortcoming, which is yet to be assigned a CVE identifier, relates to a severe SQL injection vulnerability that could lead to escalated privileges and potential unauthorized access to the environment. "An SQL injection vulnerability has been found in the MOVEit Transfer web application that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to MOVEit Transfer's database," the company  said . "Depending on the database engine being used (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Azure SQL), an attacker may be able to infer information about the structure and contents of the database in addition to executing SQL statements that alter or delete database elements."

An analysis of the "evasive and tenacious" malware known as QBot has revealed that 25% of its command-and-control (C2) servers are merely active for a single day. What's more, 50% of the servers don't remain active for more than a week, indicating the use of an adaptable and dynamic  C2 infrastructure , Lumen Black Lotus Labs said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This botnet has adapted techniques to conceal its infrastructure in residential IP space and infected web servers, as opposed to hiding in a network of hosted virtual private servers (VPSs)," security researchers Chris Formosa and Steve Rudd said. QBot , also called QakBot and Pinkslipbot, is a persistent and potent threat that started off as a banking trojan before evolving into a downloader for other payloads, including ransomware. Its origins go back as far as 2007. The malware arrives on victims' devices via spear-phishing emails, which either directly incorporate lure files o

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously unknown advanced persistent threat (APT) is targeting iOS devices as part of a sophisticated and long-running mobile campaign dubbed  Operation Triangulation  that began in 2019. "The targets are infected using zero-click exploits via the iMessage platform, and the malware runs with root privileges, gaining complete control over the device and user data," Kaspersky  said . The Russian cybersecurity company said it discovered traces of compromise after creating offline backups of the targeted devices. The attack chain begins with the iOS device receiving a message via iMessage that contains an attachment bearing the exploit. The exploit is said to be  zero-click , meaning the receipt of the message triggers the vulnerability without requiring any user interaction in order to achieve code execution. It's also configured to retrieve additional payloads for privilege escalation and drop a final stage malware from a remote server that Kaspersky described as

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have discovered a novel attack on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that employs compiled Python code to sidestep detection by application security tools. "It may be the first supply chain attack to take advantage of the fact that Python bytecode (PYC) files can be directly executed," ReversingLabs analyst Karlo Zanki  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. The package in question is  fshec2 , which was removed from the package registry on April 17, 2023, following responsible disclosure on the same day. PYC files are compiled bytecode files that are generated by the Python interpreter when a Python program is executed. "When a module is imported for the first time (or when the source file has changed since the current compiled file was created) a .pyc file containing the compiled code should be created in a __pycache__ subdirectory of the directory containing the .py file,"  explains  the Python documentation.

IT hygiene  is a security best practice that ensures that digital assets in an organization's environment are secure and running properly. Good IT hygiene includes vulnerability management, security configuration assessments, maintaining asset and system inventories, and comprehensive visibility into the activities occurring in an environment. As technology advances and the tools used by cybercriminals and cybersecurity professionals evolve, the strategies used to carry out cyber attacks differ based on their complexity and uniqueness. Threat actors continuously target organizations practicing poor IT hygiene to exploit known security weaknesses and human error. Security administrators can defend against cyberattacks by implementing good  IT hygiene  practices like whitelisting programs, keeping systems up to date, and more. Gaining complete visibility into the IT assets is fundamental to developing an effective security strategy. The emergence of shadow IT, like rogue assets, s

The threat actors behind BlackCat ransomware have come up with an improved variant that prioritizes speed and stealth in an attempt to bypass security guardrails and achieve their goals. The new version, dubbed  Sphynx  and announced in February 2023, packs a "number of updated capabilities that strengthen the group's efforts to evade detection," IBM Security X-Force said in a new analysis. The "product" update was  first highlighted  by vx-underground in April 2023. Trend Micro, last month,  detailed  a Linux version of Sphynx that's "focused primarily on its encryption routine." BlackCat , also called ALPHV and Noberus, is the first Rust-language-based ransomware strain spotted in the wild. Active since November 2021, it has emerged as a formidable ransomware actor, victimizing  more than 350 targets  as of May 2023.

Cybersecurity researchers have offered a closer look at the RokRAT remote access trojan that's employed by the North Korean state-sponsored actor known as  ScarCruft . "RokRAT is a sophisticated remote access trojan (RAT) that has been observed as a critical component within the attack chain, enabling the threat actors to gain unauthorized access, exfiltrate sensitive information, and potentially maintain persistent control over compromised systems," ThreatMon  said . ScarCruft , active since at least 2012, is a  cyber espionage group  that operates on behalf of the North Korean government, exclusively focusing on targets in its southern counterpart. The group is believed to be a subordinate element within North Korea's Ministry of State Security (MSS).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WordPress has issued an automatic update to address a critical flaw in the  Jetpack plugin  that's installed on over five million sites. The vulnerability, which was unearthed during an internal security audit, resides in an API present in the plugin since  version 2.0 , which was released in November 2012. "This vulnerability could be used by authors on a site to manipulate any files in the WordPress installation," Jetpack  said  in an advisory. 102 new versions of Jetpack have been released to remediate the bug. While there is no evidence the issue has been exploited in the wild, it's not uncommon for flaws in popular WordPress plugins to be leveraged by threat actors looking to take over the sites for malicious ends. This is not the first time severe security weaknesses in Jetpack have prompted WordPress to force install the patches. In November 2019, Jetpack released  version 7.9.1  to fix a defect in the way the plugin handled embed code that had existed since July 2017 (ve

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A financially motivated threat actor is actively scouring the internet for unprotected  Apache NiFi instances  to covertly install a cryptocurrency miner and facilitate lateral movement. The findings come from the SANS Internet Storm Center (ISC), which detected a spike in HTTP requests for "/nifi" on May 19, 2023. "Persistence is achieved via timed processors or entries to cron,"  said  Dr. Johannes Ullrich, dean of research for SANS Technology Institute. "The attack script is not saved to the system. The attack scripts are kept in memory only." A honeypot setup allowed the ISC to determine that the initial foothold is weaponized to drop a shell script that removes the "/var/log/syslog" file, disables the firewall, and terminates competing crypto-mining tools, before downloading and launching the Kinsing malware from a remote server. It's worth pointing out that  Kinsing  has a  track record  of  leveraging  publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in publicly accessible web applicati

Cybersecurity researchers have found "backdoor-like behavior" within Gigabyte systems, which they say enables the  UEFI firmware  of the devices to drop a Windows executable and retrieve updates in an unsecure format. Firmware security firm Eclypsium  said  it first detected the anomaly in April 2023. Gigabyte has since acknowledged and addressed the issue. "Most Gigabyte firmware includes a Windows Native Binary executable embedded inside of the UEFI firmware," John Loucaides, senior vice president of strategy at Eclypsium, told The Hacker News. "The detected Windows executable is dropped to disk and executed as part of the Windows startup process, similar to the  LoJack double agent attack . This executable then downloads and runs additional binaries via insecure methods." "Only the intention of the author can distinguish this sort of vulnerability from a malicious backdoor," Loucaides added. The executable, per Eclypsium, is embedded in

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Improperly deactivated and abandoned Salesforce  Sites  and  Communities  (aka Experience Cloud) could pose severe risks to organizations, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data. Data security firm Varonis dubbed the abandoned, unprotected, and unmonitored resources " ghost sites ." "When these Communities are no longer needed, though, they are often set aside but not deactivated," Varonis Threat Labs researchers  said  in a new report shared with The Hacker News. "Because these unused sites are not maintained, they aren't tested against vulnerabilities, and Admins fail to update the site's security measures according to newer guidelines." Varonis said it found many of these deactivated (but still active) sites still fetching new data, thereby allowing threat actors to extract data by manipulating the  host header  in the HTTP request. Identifying the complete internal URLs associated with the sites is challenging but not impossible, as an adversary could leverage too

Microsoft Details Critical Apple macOS Vulnerability Allowing SIP Protection Bypass<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/microsoft-details-critical-apple-macos.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has shared details of a now-patched flaw in Apple macOS that could be abused by threat actors with root access to bypass security enforcements and perform arbitrary actions on affected devices. Specifically, the flaw – dubbed  Migraine  and tracked as CVE-2023-32369 – could be abused to get around a key security measure called System Integrity Protection ( SIP ), or "rootless," which limits the actions the root user can perform on protected files and folders. "The most straight-forward implication of a SIP bypass is that [...] an attacker can create files that are protected by SIP and therefore undeletable by ordinary means," Microsoft researchers Jonathan Bar Or, Michael Pearse, and Anurag Bohra  said . Even worse, it could be exploited to gain arbitrary kernel code execution and even access sensitive data by replacing databases that manage Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) policies. The bypass is made possible by leveraging a built-in macOS tool called  Migrat

Finding threat actors before they find you is key to beefing up your cyber defenses. How to do that efficiently and effectively is no small task – but with a small investment of time, you can master threat hunting and save your organization millions of dollars. Consider this staggering statistic. Cybersecurity Ventures estimates that cybercrime will take a $10.5 trillion toll on the global economy by 2025. Measuring this amount as a country, the cost of cybercrime equals the world's third-largest economy after the U.S. and China. But with effective threat hunting, you can keep bad actors from wreaking havoc on your organization. This article offers a detailed explanation of threat hunting – what it is, how to do it thoroughly and effectively, and how cyber threat intelligence (CTI) can bolster your threat-hunting efforts. What is threat hunting? Cyber threat hunting is gathering evidence that a threat is materializing. It's a continuous process that helps you find the threats that

The threat actor known as  Dark Pink  has been linked to five new attacks aimed at various entities in Belgium, Brunei, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam between February 2022 and April 2023. This includes educational institutions, government agencies, military bodies, and non-profit organizations, indicating the adversarial crew's continued focus on high-value targets. Dark Pink, also called Saaiwc Group, is an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor believed to be of Asia-Pacific origin, with  attacks   targeting  entities primarily located in East Asia and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. The group employs a set of custom malware tools such as TelePowerBot and KamiKakaBot that provide various functions to exfiltrate sensitive data from compromised hosts. "The group uses a range of sophisticated custom tools, deploys multiple kill chains relying on spear-phishing emails," Group-IB security researcher Andrey Polovinkin  said  in a technical report shared with The Hacker News.

The threat actors behind  RomCom RAT  are leveraging a network of fake websites advertising rogue versions of popular software at least since July 2022 to infiltrate targets. Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro is tracking the activity cluster under the name Void Rabisu, which is also known as Tropical Scorpius (Unit 42) and UNC2596 (Mandiant). "These lure sites are most likely only meant for a small number of targets, thus making discovery and analysis more difficult," security researchers Feike Hacquebord, Stephen Hilt, Fernando Merces, and Lord Alfred Remorin  said . Some of the impersonated apps spotted so far include AstraChat, Devolutions' Remote Desktop Manager, Gimp, GoTo Meeting, KeePass, OpenAI ChatGPT, Signal, Veeam Backup & Replication, and WinDirStat.

Cybersecurity researchers are warning about CAPTCHA-breaking services that are being offered for sale to bypass systems designed to distinguish legitimate users from bot traffic. "Because cybercriminals are keen on breaking CAPTCHAs accurately, several services that are primarily geared toward this market demand have been created," Trend Micro  said  in a report published last week. "These CAPTCHA-solving services don't use [optical character recognition] techniques or advanced machine learning methods; instead, they break CAPTCHAs by farming out CAPTCHA-breaking tasks to actual human solvers." CAPTCHA  – short for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart – is a tool for differentiating real human users from automated users with the goal of combating spam and restricting fake account creation. While CAPTCHA mechanisms can be a  disruptive user experience , they are seen as an effective means to counter attacks from bot-ori

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have discovered an inexpensive attack technique that could be leveraged to brute-force fingerprints on smartphones to bypass user authentication and seize control of the devices. The approach, dubbed  BrutePrint , bypasses limits put in place to counter failed biometric authentication attempts by weaponizing two zero-day vulnerabilities in the smartphone fingerprint authentication (SFA) framework. The flaws, Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), leverage logical defects in the authentication framework, which arises due to insufficient protection of fingerprint data on the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) of fingerprint sensors. The result is a "hardware approach to do man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks for fingerprint image hijacking," researchers Yu Chen and Yiling He  said  in a research paper. "BrutePrint acts as a middleman between fingerprint sensor and  TEE  [Trusted Execution Environment]." The goal, at its core, is to be

Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET  said  it identified over 240,000 detections of the crypter in its telemetry in 2021 and 2022. This amounts to more than 10,000 hits per month. Some of the prominent malware families contained within AceCryptor are SmokeLoader, RedLine Stealer, RanumBot, Raccoon Stealer, Stop ransomware, and Amadey, among others. The countries with the most detections include Peru, Egypt, Thailand, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Poland, and India. AceCryptor was  first highlighted  by Avast in August 2022, detailing the use of the malware to distribute Stop ransomware and RedLine Stealer on Discord in the form of 7-Zip files. Crypters  are similar to packers, but instead of using compression, they are known to obfuscate the malware code with encryption to make detection and reverse engineering a lot more challenging.

If you're a cybersecurity professional, you're likely familiar with the sea of acronyms our industry is obsessed with. From CNAPP, to CWPP, to CIEM and all of the myriad others, there seems to be a new initialism born each day. In this article, we'll look at another trending acronym – CTEM, which stands for Continuous Threat Exposure Management – and the often-surprising challenges that come along with seeing a CTEM program through to maturity. While the concept of CTEM isn't brand spanking new, having made its in-print debut in July of 2022, we are now at the point where many organizations are starting to try to operationalize the programs that they've been setting into motion over the last few months. And as organizations start to execute their carefully designed plans, they may find themselves bumping up against some unexpected challenges which can lead to setbacks.  What is Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM)?

New GobRAT Remote Access Trojan Targeting Linux Routers in Japan<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/new-gobrat-remote-access-trojan.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Linux routers in Japan are the target of a new Golang remote access trojan (RAT) called  GobRAT . "Initially, the attacker targets a router whose WEBUI is open to the public, executes scripts possibly by using vulnerabilities, and finally infects the GobRAT," the JPCERT Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC)  said  in a report published today. The compromise of an internet-exposed router is followed by the deployment of a loader script that acts as a conduit for delivering GobRAT, which, when launched, masquerades as the Apache daemon process (apached) to evade detection. The loader is also equipped to disable firewalls, establish persistence using the cron job scheduler, and register an SSH public key in the  .ssh/authorized_keys file  for remote access. GobRAT, for its part, communicates with a remote server via the Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) protocol to receive as many as 22 different encrypted commands for execution. Some of the major commands are as follows - Obt

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing technique called "file archiver in the browser" can be leveraged to "emulate" a file archiver software in a web browser when a victim visits a .ZIP domain. "With this phishing attack, you simulate a file archiver software (e.g., WinRAR) in the browser and use a .zip domain to make it appear more legitimate," security researcher mr.d0x  disclosed  last week. Threat actors, in a nutshell, could create a realistic-looking  phishing landing page  using HTML and CSS that mimics legitimate file archive software, and host it on a .zip domain, thus elevating  social engineering campaigns . In a potential attack scenario, a miscreant could resort to such trickery to redirect users to a credential harvesting page when a file "contained" within the fake ZIP archive is clicked. "Another interesting use case is listing a non-executable file and when the user clicks to initiate a download, it downloads an executable file," mr.d0x

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Python Package Index (PyPI) announced last week that every account that maintains a project on the official third-party software repository will be required to turn on two-factor authentication ( 2FA ) by the end of the year. "Between now and the end of the year, PyPI will begin gating access to certain site functionality based on 2FA usage," PyPI administrator Donald Stufft said. "In addition, we may begin selecting certain users or projects for early enforcement." The enforcement also includes  organization maintainers , but does not extend to every single user of the service. The goal is to neutralize the threats posed by account takeover attacks, which an attacker can leverage to distribute trojanized versions of popular packages to poison the software supply chain and deploy malware on a large scale. PyPI, like other open source repositories such as npm, has  witnessed  innumerable instances of malware and package impersonation. Earlier this month, F

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new stealthy information stealer malware called Bandit Stealer has caught the attention of cybersecurity researchers for its ability to target numerous web browsers and cryptocurrency wallets.  "It has the potential to expand to other platforms as Bandit Stealer was developed using the Go programming language, possibly allowing cross-platform compatibility," Trend Micro  said  in a Friday report. The malware is currently focused on targeting Windows by using a legitimate command-line tool called  runas.exe  that allows users to run programs as another user with different permissions. The goal is to escalate privileges and execute itself with administrative access, thereby effectively bypassing security measures to harvest wide swathes of data. That said, Microsoft's access control mitigations to prevent unauthorized execution of the tool means an attempt to run the malware binary as an administrator requires providing the necessary credentials.

Critical OAuth Vulnerability in Expo Framework Allows Account Hijacking<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/critical-oauth-vulnerability-in-expo.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical security vulnerability has been disclosed in the Open Authorization (OAuth) implementation of the application development framework Expo.io. The shortcoming, assigned the CVE identifier  CVE-2023-28131 , has a severity rating of 9.6 on the CVSS scoring system. API security firm Salt Labs  said  the issue rendered services using the framework susceptible to credential leakage, which could then be used to hijack accounts and siphon sensitive data. Under certain circumstances, a threat actor could have taken advantage of the flaw to perform arbitrary actions on behalf of a compromised user on various platforms such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter. Expo, similar to Electron, is an open source platform for developing universal native apps that run on Android, iOS, and the web. It's worth noting that for the attack to be successful, sites and applications using Expo should have configured the AuthSession Proxy setting for single sign-on (SSO) using a third-party provider

Severe Flaw in Google Cloud's Cloud SQL Service Exposed Confidential Data<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/severe-flaw-in-google-clouds-cloud-sql.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new security flaw has been disclosed in the Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Cloud SQL service that could be potentially exploited to obtain access to confidential data. "The vulnerability could have enabled a malicious actor to escalate from a basic Cloud SQL user to a full-fledged sysadmin on a container, gaining access to internal GCP data like secrets, sensitive files, passwords, in addition to customer data," Israeli cloud security firm Dig  said . Cloud SQL  is a fully-managed solution to build MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server databases for cloud-based applications. The multi-stage attack chain identified by Dig, in a nutshell, leveraged a gap in the cloud platform's security layer associated with SQL Server to escalate the privileges of a user to that of an administrator role. The elevated permissions subsequently made it possible to abuse another critical misconfiguration to obtain system administrator rights and take full control of the database server.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have detailed the inner workings of the commercial Android spyware called Predator, which is marketed by the Israeli company Intellexa (previously Cytrox). Predator was  first documented  by Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) in May 2022 as part of attacks leveraging five different zero-day flaws in the Chrome web browser and Android. The spyware, which is delivered by means of another loader component called Alien, is equipped to record audio from phone calls and VoIP-based apps as well as gather contacts and messages, including from Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram. Its other functionalities allow it to hide applications and prevent applications from being executed upon rebooting the handset. "A deep dive into both spyware components indicates that Alien is more than just a loader for Predator and actively sets up the low-level capabilities needed for Predator to spy on its victims," Cisco Talos  said  in a technical report.

5G is a game changer for mobile connectivity, including mobile connectivity to the cloud. The technology provides high speed and low latency when connecting smartphones and IoT devices to cloud infrastructure. 5G networks are a critical part of all infrastructure layers between the end user and the end service; these networks transmit sensitive data that can be vital for governments and businesses, not to mention individuals. As a result, 5G networks are a prime target for attackers. For this reason, cybersecurity has been a key consideration in developing the 5G standard. 5G encompasses robust security features that guarantee confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network services and user data. In this article, Seva Vayner, Product Owner of  Gcore's Edge Cloud service , gives a deep dive into five of 5 G's cutting-edge security measures.

Email protection and network security services provider Barracuda is warning users about a zero-day flaw that it said has been exploited to breach the company's Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances. The zero-day is being tracked as  CVE-2023-2868  and has been described as a remote code injection vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001 through 9.2.0.006. The California-headquartered firm  said  the issue is rooted in a component that screens the attachments of incoming emails. "The vulnerability arises out of a failure to comprehensively sanitize the processing of .tar file (tape archives)," according to an  advisory  from the NIST's national vulnerability database. "The vulnerability stems from incomplete input validation of a user-supplied .tar file as it pertains to the names of the files contained within the archive. As a consequence, a remote attacker can specifically format these file names in a particular manner that will result in remotely exe

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hospital with 2,000 employees in the E.U. deployed Cynet protections across its environment. The hospital was in the process of upgrading several expensive imaging systems that were still supported by Windows XP and Windows 7 machines. Cynet protections were in place on most of the Windows XP and Windows 7 machines during the upgrade process, ensuring that legacy operating systems would not cause vulnerabilities or delay the activation of an  incident response plan . The hospital's I.T. security team appreciated this coverage after their previous provider abandoned support for Windows XP and Windows 7. "One of the many reasons we chose Cynet was their support of legacy Windows machines. It's expensive, difficult and time consuming to upgrade our imaging system software, but we needed protections as we slowly migrated to more current Windows environments. Cynet was one of the few providers that continue to protect these older Windows environments." The Attack Alo

New PowerExchange Backdoor Used in Iranian Cyber Attack on UAE Government<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/new-powerexchange-backdoor-used-in.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unnamed government entity associated with the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) was targeted by a likely Iranian threat actor to breach the victim's Microsoft Exchange Server with a "simple yet effective" backdoor dubbed  PowerExchange . According to a new report from Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, the intrusion relied on email phishing as an initial access pathway, leading to the execution of a .NET executable contained with a ZIP file attachment. The binary, which masquerades as a PDF document, functions as a dropper to execute the final payload, which then launches the backdoor. PowerExchange, written in PowerShell, employs text files attached to emails for command-and-control (C2) communication. It allows the threat actor to run arbitrary payloads and upload and download files from and to the system. The custom implant achieves this by making use of the Exchange Web Services ( EWS ) API to connect to the victim's Exchange Server and uses a mailbox on the server to

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Brazilian threat actor is targeting more than 30 Portuguese financial institutions with information-stealing malware as part of a long-running campaign that commenced in 2021. "The attackers can steal credentials and exfiltrate users' data and personal information, which can be leveraged for malicious activities beyond financial gain," SentinelOne researchers Aleksandar Milenkoski and Tom Hegel  said  in a new report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity firm, which began tracking "Operation Magalenha" earlier this year, said the intrusions culminate in the deployment of two variants of a backdoor called  PeepingTitle  so as to "maximize attack potency." The links to Brazil stem from the use of the Brazilian-Portuguese language within the detected artifacts as well as source code overlaps with another banking trojan known as  Maxtrilha , which was first disclosed in September 2021. PeepingTitle, like Maxtrilha, is written in the Delphi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind the nascent  Buhti  ransomware have eschewed their custom payload in favor of leaked LockBit and Babuk ransomware families to strike Windows and Linux systems. "While the group doesn't develop its own ransomware, it does utilize what appears to be one custom-developed tool, an information stealer designed to search for and archive specified file types," Symantec  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity firm is tracking the cybercrime group under the name  Blacktail . Buhti was first highlighted by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 in February 2023,  describing  it as a Golang ransomware targeting the Linux platform. Later that same month, Bitdefender revealed the use of a Windows variant that was deployed against Zoho ManageEngine products that were vulnerable to critical remote code execution flaws ( CVE-2022-47966 ).

A stealthy China-based group managed to establish a persistent foothold into critical infrastructure organizations in the U.S. and Guam without being detected,  Microsoft  and  the "Five Eyes" nations  said on Wednesday. The tech giant's threat intelligence team is tracking the activity, which includes post-compromise credential access and network system discovery, under the name  Volt Typhoon . The state-sponsored actor is  geared  towards espionage and information gathering, with the cluster active since June 2021 and obscuring its intrusion footprint by taking advantage of tools already installed or built into infected machines. Some of the prominent sectors targeted include communications, manufacturing, utility, transportation, construction, maritime, government, information technology, and education.

Iranian Agrius Hackers Targeting Israeli Organizations with Moneybird Ransomware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/iranian-agrius-hackers-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian threat actor known as  Agrius  is leveraging a new ransomware strain called Moneybird in its attacks targeting Israeli organizations. Agrius, also known as Pink Sandstorm (formerly Americium), has a  track record  of staging destructive data-wiping attacks aimed at Israel under the guise of ransomware infections. Microsoft has attributed the threat actor to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), which also operates  MuddyWater . It's known to be active since at least December 2020. In December 2022, the hacking crew was  attributed  to a set of attempted disruptive intrusions that were directed against diamond industries in South Africa, Israel, and Hong Kong. These attacks involved the use of a .NET-based wiper-turned-ransomware called  Apostle  and its successor known as Fantasy. Unlike Apostle, Moneybird is programmed in C++. "The use of a new ransomware, written in C++, is noteworthy, as it demonstrates the group's expanding capabil

At least eight websites associated with shipping, logistics, and financial services companies in Israel were targeted as part of a watering hole attack.

"The infected sites collect preliminary user information through a script," ClearSky  said  in a technical report published Tuesday. Most of the impacted websites have been stripped of the rogue code. Tortoiseshell  is known to be active since at least July 2018, with  early attacks  targeting IT providers in Saudi Arabia. It has also been observed  setting up fake hiring websites  for U.S. military veterans in a bid to trick them into downloading remote access trojans.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
If you're involved in securing the applications your organization develops, there is no question that Static Application Security Testing (SAST) solutions are an important part of a comprehensive application security strategy. SAST secures software, supports business more securely, cuts down on costs, reduces risk, and speeds time to development, delivery, and deployment of mission-critical applications.  SAST scans code early during development, so your AppSec team won't be scrambling to fix unexpected vulnerabilities right before that big launch is planned. You'll avoid surprises and launch delays without inadvertently releasing risky software to customers — or into production.  But if you consider SAST as a part of a larger AppSec platform, crucial for those who wish to  shift security everywhere  possible in the software development life cycle (SDLC), some SAST solutions outshine others.  Knowing what to focus on With a plethora of players in the market, sometimes

Google has removed a screen recording app named "iRecorder - Screen Recorder" from the Play Store after it was found to sneak in information stealing capabilities nearly a year after the app was published as an innocuous app. The app (APK package name "com.tsoft.app.iscreenrecorder"), which accrued over 50,000 installations, was first uploaded on September 19, 2021. The malicious functionality is believed to have been introduced in version 1.3.8, which was released on August 24, 2022. "It is rare for a developer to upload a legitimate app, wait almost a year, and then update it with malicious code," ESET security researcher Lukáš Štefanko  said  in a technical report. "The malicious code that was added to the clean version of iRecorder is based on the open source  AhMyth  Android RAT (remote access trojan) and has been customized into what we named AhRat." iRecorder was  first flagged  as harboring the AhMyth trojan on October 28, 2022, by

An updated version of the commodity malware called Legion comes with expanded features to compromise SSH servers and Amazon Web Services (AWS) credentials associated with DynamoDB and CloudWatch. "This recent update demonstrates a widening of scope, with new capabilities such the ability to compromise SSH servers and retrieve additional AWS-specific credentials from Laravel web applications," Cado Labs researcher Matt Muir  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "It's clear that the developer's targeting of cloud services is advancing with each iteration." Legion, a Python-based hack tool, was  first documented  last month by the cloud security firm, detailing its ability to breach vulnerable SMTP servers in order to harvest credentials. It's also known to exploit web servers running content management systems (CMS), leverage Telegram as a data exfiltration point, and send spam SMS messages to a list of dynamically-generated U.S. mobile num

N. Korean Lazarus Group Targets Microsoft IIS Servers to Deploy Espionage Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/n-korean-lazarus-group-targets.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The infamous Lazarus Group actor has been targeting vulnerable versions of Microsoft Internet Information Services ( IIS ) servers as an initial breach route to deploy malware on targeted systems. The findings come from the AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC), which detailed the advanced persistent threat's (APT) continued abuse of DLL side-loading techniques to run arbitrary payloads. "The threat actor places a malicious DLL (msvcr100.dll) in the same folder path as a normal application (Wordconv.exe) via the Windows IIS web server process, w3wp.exe," ASEC explained . "They then execute the normal application to initiate the execution of the malicious DLL." DLL side-loading , similar to DLL search-order hijacking, refers to the proxy execution of a rogue DLL via a benign binary planted in the same directory. Lazarus , a highly-capable and relentless nation-state group linked to North Korea, was most recently spotted leveraging the same t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has warned of cyber attacks targeting state bodies in the country as part of an espionage campaign. The  intrusion set , attributed to a threat actor tracked by the authority as UAC-0063 since 2021, leverages phishing lures to deploy a variety of malicious tools on infected systems. The origins of the hacking crew are presently unknown. In the attack chain described by the agency, the emails targeted an unspecified ministry and purported to be from the Embassy of Tajikistan in Ukraine. It's suspected that the messages were sent from a previously compromised mailbox. The emails come attached with a Microsoft Word document that, upon enabling macros, launches an encoded VBScript called HATVIBE, which is then used to drop additional malware. This includes a keylogger (LOGPIE), a Python-based backdoor capable of running commands sent from a remote server (CHERRYSPY), and a tool focused on exfiltrating files with specific e

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government and diplomatic entities in the Middle East and South Asia are the target of a new advanced persistent threat actor named  GoldenJackal . Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which has been  keeping tabs  on the group's activities since mid-2020, characterized the adversary as both capable and stealthy. The targeting scope of the campaign is focused on Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and Turkey, infecting victims with tailored malware that steals data, propagates across systems via removable drives, and conducts surveillance. GoldenJackal is suspected to have been active for at least four years, although little is known about the group. Kaspersky said it has been unable to determine its origin or affiliation with known threat actors, but the actor's modus operandi suggests an espionage motivation. What's more, the threat actor's attempts to maintain a low profile and disappear into the shadows bears all the hallmarks of a state-sponsored g

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as Kimsuky has been observed using a piece of custom malware called RandomQuery as part of a reconnaissance and information exfiltration operation. "Lately, Kimsuky has been consistently distributing custom malware as part of reconnaissance campaigns to enable subsequent attacks," SentinelOne researchers Aleksandar Milenkoski and Tom Hegel said in a report published today. The ongoing targeted campaign, per the cybersecurity firm, is primarily geared towards information services as well as organizations supporting human rights activists and North Korean defectors. Kimsuky, active since 2012, has exhibited targeting patterns that align with North Korea's operational mandates and priorities. The intelligence collection missions have involved the use of a diverse set of malware, including another reconnaissance program called ReconShark , as detailed by SentinelOne earlier this month.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The most precious asset in today's information age is the secret safeguarded under lock and key. Regrettably, maintaining secrets has become increasingly challenging, as highlighted by the  2023 State of Secrets Sprawl  report, the largest analysis of public GitHub activity.  The report shows a  67% year-over-year increase  in the number of secrets found, with 10 million hard-coded secrets detected in 2022 alone. This alarming surge in secrets sprawl highlights  the need for action  and underscores the importance of secure software development. Secrets sprawl refers to secrets appearing in plaintext in various sources, such as source code, build scripts, infrastructure as code, logs, etc. While secrets like API tokens and private keys securely connect the components of the modern software supply chain, their widespread distribution among developers, machines, applications, and infrastructure systems heightens the likelihood of leaks.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been observed leveraging a malicious Windows kernel driver in attacks likely targeting the Middle East since at least May 2020. Fortinet Fortiguard Labs, which dubbed the artifact WINTAPIX (WinTapix.sys), attributed the malware with low confidence to an Iranian threat actor. "WinTapix.sys is essentially a loader," security researchers Geri Revay and Hossein Jazi said in a report published on Monday. "Thus, its primary purpose is to produce and execute the next stage of the attack. This is done using a shellcode." Samples and telemetry data analyzed by Fortinet show that the campaign's primary focus is on Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The activity has not been tied to a known threat actor or group. By using a malicious kernel mode driver, the idea is to subvert or disable security mechanisms and gain entrenched access to the targeted host. Such drivers run within the kernel memory and can, there

"The purpose of this network security review of Micron's products is to prevent product network security problems from endangering the security of national critical information infrastructure, which is a necessary measure to maintain national security," the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC)  said . The CAC further said the investigation found "serious cybersecurity problems" in Micron's products, endangering the country's critical information infrastructure supply chain.

Facebook's parent company Meta has been fined a record $1.3 billion by European Union data protection regulators for transferring the personal data of users in the region to the U.S. In a binding decision taken by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), the social media giant has been ordered to bring its data transfers into compliance with the GDPR and delete unlawfully stored and processed data within six months. Additionally, Meta has been given five months to suspend any future transfer of Facebook users' data to the U.S. Instagram and WhatsApp, which are also owned by the company, are not subject to the order. "The EDPB found that Meta IE's infringement is very serious since it concerns transfers that are systematic, repetitive, and continuous," Andrea Jelinek, EDPB Chair,  said  in a statement. "Facebook has millions of users in Europe, so the volume of personal data transferred is massive. The unprecedented fine is a strong signal to organizati

Indonesian Cybercriminals Exploit AWS for Profitable Crypto Mining Operations<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/indonesian-cybercriminals-exploit-aws.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A financially motivated threat actor of Indonesian origin has been observed leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances to carry out illicit crypto mining operations. Cloud security company's Permiso P0 Labs, which first detected the group in November 2021, has assigned it the moniker  GUI-vil  (pronounced Goo-ee-vil). "The group displays a preference for Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools, specifically S3 Browser (version 9.5.5) for their initial operations," the company said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Upon gaining AWS Console access, they conduct their operations directly through the web browser." Attack chains mounted by GUI-vil entail obtaining initial access by weaponizing AWS keys in publicly exposed source code repositories on GitHub or scanning for GitLab instances that are vulnerable to remote code execution flaws (e.g.,  CVE-2021-22205 ). A successful ingress is followed by privilege escalation and

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New findings about a hacker group linked to cyber attacks targeting companies in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict area reveal that it may have been around for much longer than previously thought. The threat actor, tracked as  Bad Magic  (aka Red Stinger), has not only been linked to a fresh sophisticated campaign, but also to an activity cluster that first came to light in May 2016. "While the previous targets were primarily located in the Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea regions, the scope has now widened to include individuals, diplomatic entities, and research organizations in Western and Central Ukraine," Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky  said  in a technical report published last week. The campaign is characterized by the use of a novel modular framework codenamed CloudWizard, which features capabilities to take screenshots, record microphone, log keystrokes, grab passwords, and harvest Gmail inboxes. Bad Magic was  first documented  by the company in March 2023, detail

It's no secret that data leaks have become a major concern for both citizens and institutions across the globe. They can cause serious damage to an organization's reputation, induce considerable financial losses, and even have serious legal repercussions. From the infamous Cambridge Analytica scandal to the Equifax data breach, there have been some pretty high-profile leaks resulting in massive consequences for the world's biggest brands. Breaches can also have a huge impact on individuals as well – ultimately leading to the loss of personal information, such as passwords or credit card details, which could be used by criminals for malicious purposes. Most notably victims are left vulnerable to identity theft or financial fraud.  When you think about the sheer volume of these leaks, one would imagine that the world would stop and focus on the attack vector(s) being exploited. The unfortunate reality is the world didn't stop. To make things more interesting, the most

A U.K. national responsible for his role as the administrator of the now-defunct  iSpoof  online phone number spoofing service has been sentenced to 13 years and 4 months in prison. Tejay Fletcher, 35, of Western Gateway, London, was awarded the sentence on May 18, 2023. He  pleaded guilty  last month to a number of cyber offenses, including facilitating fraud and possessing and transferring criminal property. iSpoof , which was available as a paid service, allowed fraudsters to mask their phone numbers and masquerade as representatives from banks, tax offices, and other official bodies to defraud victims. The help desk scam purported to warn targets of suspicious activity on their accounts and tricked them into disclosing sensitive financial information or transferring money to accounts under the threat actor's control.

A proof-of-concept (PoC) has been made available for a security flaw impacting the KeePass password manager that could be exploited to recover a victim's master password in cleartext under specific circumstances. The issue, tracked as  CVE-2023-32784 , impacts KeePass versions 2.x for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and is  expected to be patched  in version 2.54, which is likely to be released early next month. "Apart from the first password character, it is mostly able to recover the password in plaintext," security researcher "vdohney," who discovered the flaw and devised a PoC,  said . "No code execution on the target system is required, just a memory dump." "It doesn't matter where the memory comes from," the researcher added, stating, "it doesn't matter whether or not the workspace is locked. It is also possible to dump the password from RAM after KeePass is no longer running, although the chance of that working goes down w

The maintainers of Python Package Index (PyPI), the official third-party software repository for the Python programming language, have temporarily disabled the ability for users to sign up and upload new packages until further notice. "The volume of malicious users and malicious projects being created on the index in the past week has outpaced our ability to respond to it in a timely fashion, especially with multiple PyPI administrators on leave," the admins  said  in a notice published on May 20, 2023. No additional details about the nature of the malware and threat actors involved in publishing those rogue packages to PyPI were disclosed. The decision to freeze new user and project registrations comes as software registries such as PyPI have proven time and time again to be a popular target for attackers looking to poison the software supply chain and compromise developer environments.

The identity of the second threat actor behind the Golden Chickens malware has been uncovered courtesy of a "fatal" operational security blunder, cybersecurity firm eSentire said.

He is one of the two criminals operating an account on the Russian-language Exploit.in forum under the name "badbullzvenom," the other being " Chuck from Montreal ." eSentire characterized Jack as the true mastermind behind Golden Chickens. Evidence unearthed by the Canadian company shows that he is also listed as the owner of a vegetable and fruit import and export business. "Like 'Chuck from Montreal,' 'Jack' uses multiple aliases for the underground forums, social media, and Jabber accounts, and he too has gone to great lengths to disguise himself," eSentire researchers Joe Stewart and Keegan Keplinger said .

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious cybercrime group known as FIN7 has been observed deploying  Cl0p  (aka Clop) ransomware, marking the threat actor's first ransomware campaign since late 2021. Microsoft, which detected the activity in April 2023, is tracking the financially motivated actor under its new taxonomy  Sangria Tempest . "In these recent attacks, Sangria Tempest uses the PowerShell script POWERTRASH to load the Lizar post-exploitation tool and get a foothold into a target network," the company's threat intelligence team  said . "They then use OpenSSH and Impacket to move laterally and deploy Clop ransomware." FIN7  (aka Carbanak, ELBRUS, and ITG14) has been linked to other ransomware families such as Black Basta, DarkSide, REvil, and LockBit, with the threat actor acting as a precursor for Maze and Ryuk ransomware attacks.  Active since at least 2012, the group has a  track record  of  targeting  a broad spectrum of organizations spanning software, consulting, f

Warning: Samsung Devices Under Attack! New Security Flaw Exposed<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/samsung-devices-under-active.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned of active exploitation of a medium-severity flaw affecting Samsung devices. The issue, tracked as  CVE-2023-21492  (CVSS score: 4.4), impacts select Samsung devices running Android versions 11, 12, and 13. The South Korean electronics giant described the issue as an information disclosure flaw that could be exploited by a privileged attacker to bypass address space layout randomization ( ASLR ) protections. ASLR is a  security technique  that's designed to thwart memory corruption and code execution flaws by obscuring the location of an executable in a device's memory. Samsung, in an  advisory  released this month, said it was "notified that an exploit for this issue had existed in the wild," adding it was privately disclosed to the company on January 17, 2023. Other details about how the flaw is being exploited are currently not known, but vulnerabilities in Samsung phones have been weapon

Privacy Sandbox Initiative: Google to Phase Out Third-Party Cookies Starting 2024<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/privacy-sandbox-initiative-google-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has announced plans to officially flip the switch on its twice-delayed  Privacy Sandbox  initiatives as it slowly works its way to deprecate support for third-party cookies in Chrome browser. To that end, the search and advertising giant said it intends to phase out third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users globally in the first quarter of 2024. "This will support developers in conducting real world experiments that assess the readiness and effectiveness of their products without third-party cookies," Anthony Chavez, vice president of Privacy Sandbox at Google,  said . Prior to rolling this out, Google said it would introduce the ability for third-party developers to simulate the process for a configurable subset of their users (up to 10%) in Q4 2023. Google further emphasized that the plans have been designed and developed with regulatory oversight and input from the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ), which is overseeing the implementation to

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Active Directory (AD) is among the oldest pieces of software still used in the production environment and can be found in most organizations today. This is despite the fact that its historical security gaps have never been amended. For example, because of its inability to apply any security measures beyond checking for a password and username match, AD (as well the resources it manages) is dangerously exposed to the use of compromised credentials. Furthermore, this exposure is not confined to the on-prem environment. The common practice of syncing passwords between AD and the cloud identity provider means any AD breach is a potential risk to the SaaS environment as well. In this article, we'll explore AD's inherent security weaknesses and examine their scope and potential impact. We'll then learn how Silverfort's Unified Identity Protection platform can address these weaknesses at their root and provide organizations using AD with the resiliency they need to thwart identity threa

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two malicious packages discovered in the npm package repository have been found to conceal an open source information stealer malware called  TurkoRat . The packages – named nodejs-encrypt-agent and nodejs-cookie-proxy-agent – were collectively downloaded approximately 1,200 times and were available for more than two months before they were identified and taken down. ReversingLabs, which broke down the details of the campaign, described TurkoRat as an information stealer capable of harvesting sensitive information such as login credentials, website cookies, and data from cryptocurrency wallets.  While nodejs-encrypt-agent came fitted with the malware inside, nodejs-cookie-proxy-agent was found to disguise the trojan as a dependency under the name axios-proxy. nodejs-encrypt-agent was also engineered to masquerade as another legitimate npm module known as  agent-base , which has been downloaded over 25 million times to date.

Malicious Google Search ads for generative AI services like OpenAI ChatGPT and Midjourney are being used to direct users to sketchy websites as part of a BATLOADER campaign designed to deliver  RedLine Stealer  malware. "Both AI services are extremely popular but lack first-party standalone apps (i.e., users interface with ChatGPT via their web interface while Midjourney uses Discord)," eSentire said in an analysis. "This vacuum has been exploited by threat actors looking to drive AI app-seekers to imposter web pages promoting fake apps." BATLOADER is a loader malware that's propagated via drive-by downloads where users searching for certain keywords on search engines are displayed bogus ads that, when clicked, redirect them to rogue landing pages hosting malware. The installer file, per eSentire, is rigged with an executable file (ChatGPT.exe or midjourney.exe) and a PowerShell script (Chat.ps1 or Chat-Ready.ps1) that downloads and loads RedLine Stealer

Digitalization initiatives are connecting once-isolated Operational Technology (OT) environments with their Information Technology (IT) counterparts. This digital transformation of the factory floor has accelerated the connection of machinery to digital systems and data. Computer systems for managing and monitoring digital systems and data have been added to the hardware and software used for managing and monitoring industrial devices and machines, connecting OT to IT. Such connectivity enhances productivity, reduces operational costs and speeds up processes. However, this convergence has also increased organizations' security risk, making manufacturers more susceptible to attacks. In fact, in 2022 alone, there were 2,337 security breaches of manufacturing systems, 338 with confirmed data disclosure (Verizon, 2022 DBIR Report).  Ransomware: A Growing Threat for Manufacturers The nature of attacks has also changed.

The  rising   geopolitical tensions  between China and Taiwan in recent months have sparked a noticeable uptick in cyber attacks on the East Asian island country. "From malicious emails and URLs to malware, the strain between China's claim of Taiwan as part of its territory and Taiwan's maintained independence has evolved into a worrying surge in attacks," the Trellix Advanced Research Center  said  in a new report. The attacks, which have targeted a variety of sectors in the region, are mainly designed to deliver malware and steal sensitive information, the cybersecurity firm said, adding it detected a four-fold jump in the volume of malicious emails between April 7 and April 10, 2023. Some of the most impacted industry verticals during the four-day time period were networking, manufacturing, and logistics. What's more, the spike in malicious emails targeting Taiwan has been followed by a 15x increase in PlugX detections between April 10 and April 12, 2023,

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious cryptojacking group tracked as  8220 Gang  has been spotted weaponizing a six-year-old security flaw in Oracle WebLogic servers to ensnare vulnerable instances into a botnet and distribute cryptocurrency mining malware. The flaw in question is  CVE-2017-3506  (CVSS score: 7.4), which, when successfully exploited, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely. "This allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or compromise the entire system," Trend Micro researcher Sunil Bharti  said  in a report published this week. 8220 Gang,  first documented  by Cisco Talos in late 2018, is so named for its original use of port 8220 for command-and-control (C2) network communications. "8220 Gang identifies targets via scanning for misconfigured or vulnerable hosts on the public internet," SentinelOne  noted  last year.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A U.S. national has pleaded guilty in a Missouri court to operating a darknet carding site and selling financial information belonging to tens of thousands of victims in the country. Michael D. Mihalo , aka Dale Michael Mihalo Jr. and ggmccloud1, has been accused of setting up a carding site called Skynet Market that specialized in the trafficking of credit and debit card data. Mihalo and his associates also peddled their warez on other dark web marketplaces such as AlphaBay Market, Wall Street Market, and Hansa Market between February 22, 2016, and October 1, 2019. "Mihalo assembled and directed the team that helped him sell this stolen financial information on the darknet," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)  said  in a press statement released on May 16, 2023. "Mihalo personally possessed, sent, and received the information associated with 49,084 stolen payment cards with the intent that the payment card information would be trafficked on darknet sites, all i

Apple Thwarts $2 Billion in App Store Fraud, Rejects 1.7 Million App Submissions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/apple-thwarts-2-billion-in-app-store.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple has announced that it prevented over $2 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions and rejected roughly 1.7 million app submissions for privacy and security violations in 2022. The computing giant said it terminated 428,000 developer accounts for potential fraudulent activity, blocked 105,000 fake developer account creations, and deactivated 282 million bogus customer accounts. It further noted that it thwarted 198 million attempted fraudulent new accounts prior to their creation. In contrast, Apple is estimated to have booted out 802,000 developer accounts in 2021. The company attributed the decline to new App Store "methods and protocols" that prevent the creation of such accounts in the first place. "In 2022, Apple protected users from nearly 57,000 untrustworthy apps from illegitimate storefronts," the company  emphasized . "These unauthorized marketplaces distribute harmful software that can imitate popular apps or alter them without the cons

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco has released updates to address a set of nine security flaws in its Small Business Series Switches that could be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to run arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. "These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of requests that are sent to the web interface," Cisco  said , crediting an unnamed external researcher for reporting the issues. Four of the nine vulnerabilities are rated 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS scoring system, making them critical in nature. The nine flaws affect the following product lines - 250 Series Smart Switches (Fixed in firmware version 2.5.9.16) 350 Series Managed Switches (Fixed in firmware version 2.5.9.16) 350X Series Stackable Managed Switches (Fixed in firmware version 2.5.9.16) 550X Series Stackable Managed Switches (Fixed in firmware version 2.5.9.16) Business 250 Series Smart Switches (Fixed in firmware version 3.3.0.16) Business 350 Series Managed Switches (F

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hacking group dubbed  OilAlpha  with suspected ties to Yemen's  Houthi movement  has been linked to a cyber espionage campaign targeting development, humanitarian, media, and non-governmental organizations in the Arabian peninsula. "OilAlpha used encrypted chat messengers like WhatsApp to launch social engineering attacks against its targets," cybersecurity company Recorded Future  said  in a technical report published Tuesday. "It has also used URL link shorteners. Per victimology assessment, it appears a majority of the targeted entities were Arabic-language speakers and operated Android devices." OilAlpha is the new cryptonym given by Recorded Future to two overlapping clusters previously tracked by the company under the names TAG-41 and TAG-62 since April 2022. TAG-XX (short for Threat Activity Group) is the temporary moniker assigned to emerging threat groups. The assessment that the adversary is acting in the interest of the Houthi movement is base

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Software is rarely a one-and-done proposition. In fact, any application available today will likely need to be updated – or patched – to fix bugs,  address vulnerabilities , and update key features at multiple points in the future. With the typical enterprise relying on a multitude of applications, servers, and end-point devices in their day-to-day operations, the acquisition of a robust  patch management platform  to identify, test, deploy, install, and document all appropriate patches are critical for ensuring systems remain stable and secure.  As with most tech tools, not all patch management solutions are created equal, and what's seen as robust by one organization may prove inadequate for another. However, an evaluation that begins with a focus on specific key criteria – essential attributes and functionality likely to be offered by many vendors but not all – will allow IT teams to narrow down their options as they work to identify the best solution for their organization&

A financially motivated cyber actor has been observed abusing Microsoft Azure  Serial Console  on virtual machines (VMs) to install third-party remote management tools within compromised environments. Google-owned Mandiant attributed the activity to a threat group it tracks under the name  UNC3944 , which is also known as Roasted 0ktapus and Scattered Spider. "This method of attack was unique in that it avoided many of the traditional detection methods employed within Azure and provided the attacker with full administrative access to the VM," the threat intelligence firm  said . The emerging adversary, which first came to light late last year, is known to  leverage SIM swapping attacks  to breach telecommunications and business process outsourcing (BPO) companies since at least May 2022. Subsequently, Mandiant also  found  UNC3944 utilizing a loader named STONESTOP to install a malicious signed driver dubbed POORTRY that's designed to terminate processes associated

The issue, assigned the identifier  CVE-2023-27217 , was discovered and reported to Belkin on January 9, 2023, by Israeli IoT security company Sternum , which reverse-engineered the device and gained firmware access. Wemo Mini Smart Plug V2 ( F7C063 ) offers convenient remote control, allowing users to turn electronic devices on or off using a companion app installed on a smartphone or tablet. The heart of the problem lies in a feature that makes it possible to rename the smart plug to a more " FriendlyName ." The default name assigned is " Wemo mini 6E9 ." "The name length is limited to 30 characters or less, but this rule is only enforced by the app itself," security researchers Amit Serper and Reuven Yakar  said  in a report shared with The Hac

Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed previously undocumented attack infrastructure used by the prolific state-sponsored group  SideWinder  to strike entities located in Pakistan and China. This comprises a network of 55 domains and IP addresses used by the threat actor, cybersecurity companies Group-IB and Bridewell said in a joint report shared with The Hacker News. "The identified phishing domains mimic various organizations in the news, government, telecommunications, and financial sectors," researchers Nikita Rostovtsev, Joshua Penny, and Yashraj Solanki  said . SideWinder has been known to be active since at least 2012, with attack chains primarily leveraging spear-phishing as an intrusion mechanism to obtain a foothold into targeted environments. The target range of the group is widely believed to be associated with Indian espionage interests. The most frequently attacked nations include Pakistan, China, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, the Philippi

A Russian national has been charged and indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) for launching ransomware attacks against "thousands of victims" in the country and across the world. Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev  (aka  Wazawaka , m1x, Boriselcin, and Uhodiransomwar), the 30-year-old individual in question, is alleged to be a "central figure" in the development and deployment of  LockBit ,  Babuk , and  Hive  ransomware variants since at least June 2020. "These victims include law enforcement and other government agencies, hospitals, and schools," DoJ  said . "Total ransom demands allegedly made by the members of these three global ransomware campaigns to their victims amount to as much as $400 million, while total victim ransom payments amount to as much as $200 million." LockBit, Babuk, and Hive operate alike, leveraging unlawfully obtained access to exfiltrate valuable data and deploy ransomware on compromised networks. The threat actor

The Chinese nation-state actor known as  Mustang Panda  has been linked to a new set of sophisticated and targeted attacks aimed at European foreign affairs entities since January 2023. An analysis of these intrusions, per Check Point researchers Itay Cohen and Radoslaw Madej, has revealed a custom firmware implant designed explicitly for TP-Link routers. "The implant features several malicious components, including a custom backdoor named 'Horse Shell' that enables the attackers to maintain persistent access, build anonymous infrastructure, and enable lateral movement into compromised networks," the company said . "Due to its firmware-agnostic design, the implant's components can be integrated into various firmware by different vendors." The Israeli cybersecurity firm is tracking the threat group under the name Camaro Dragon,  which  is  also known as  BASIN, Bronze President, Earth Preta, HoneyMyte, RedDelta, and Red Lich.

Ransomware affiliates associated with the Qilin ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) scheme earn anywhere between 80% to 85% of each ransom payment, according to new findings from Group-IB. The cybersecurity firm said it was able to infiltrate the group in March 2023, uncovering details about the affiliates' payment structure and the inner workings of the RaaS program following a private conversation with a Qilin recruiter who goes by the online alias Haise. "Many Qilin ransomware attacks are customized for each victim to maximize their impact," the Singapore-headquartered company  said  in an exhaustive report. "To do this, the threat actors can leverage such tactics as changing the filename extensions of encrypted files and terminating specific processes and services." Qilin, also known as Agenda, was  first documented  by Trend Micro in August 2022, starting off as a Go-based ransomware before  switching to Rust  in December 2022. The adoption of Rust is also

Operational technology (OT) cybersecurity is a challenging but critical aspect of protecting organizations' essential systems and resources. Cybercriminals no longer break into systems, but instead log in – making access security more complex and also more important to manage and control than ever before. In an effort to solve the access-related challenges facing OT and critical infrastructure operators, the team at Cyolo built a zero-trust access platform designed to meet the unique safety, security, and uptime requirements of OT and industrial control systems (ICS) environments. Let's look under the hood:  The Cyolo solution is a high-powered combination of Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), Identity Provider (IdP), and Privileged Access Management (PAM). What makes this approach stand out from the pack is that other ZTNA solutions do not offer IdP or PAM capabilities, while Identity and Access Management tools (IdPs and PAMs) do not extend connectivity.

The threat actors behind the CopperStealer malware resurfaced with two new campaigns in March and April 2023 that are designed to deliver two novel payloads dubbed CopperStealth and CopperPhish. Trend Micro is tracking the financially motivated group under the name  Water Orthrus . The adversary is also assessed to be  behind   another campaign  known as  Scranos , which was detailed by Bitdefender in 2019. Active since at least 2021, Water Orthrus has a track record of leveraging pay-per-install (PPI) networks to redirect victims landing on  cracked   software download sites  to drop an information stealer codenamed  CopperStealer . Another campaign spotted in August 2022 entailed the use of CopperStealer to distribute  Chromium-based web browser extensions  that are capable of performing unauthorized transactions and transferring cryptocurrency from victims' wallets to ones under attackers' control.
