Threat actors are leveraging bogus Facebook job advertisements as a lure to trick prospective targets into installing a new Windows-based stealer malware codenamed&nbsp; Ov3r_Stealer . "This malware is designed to steal credentials and crypto wallets and send those to a Telegram channel that the threat actor monitors," Trustwave SpiderLabs said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Ov3r_Stealer is capable of siphoning IP address-based location, hardware info, passwords, cookies, credit card information, auto-fills, browser extensions, crypto wallets, Microsoft Office documents, and a list of antivirus products installed on the compromised host. While the exact end goal of the campaign is unknown, it's likely that the stolen information is offered for sale to other threat actors. Another possibility is that Ov3r_Stealer could be updated over time to act as a&nbsp; QakBot-like loader &nbsp;for additional payloads, including ransomware.

Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to the "democratization" of the phishing ecosystem owing to the emergence of Telegram as an epicenter for cybercrime, enabling threat actors to mount a mass attack for as little as $230. "This messaging app has transformed into a bustling hub where seasoned cybercriminals and newcomers alike exchange illicit tools and insights creating a dark and well-oiled supply chain of tools and victims' data," Guardio Labs researchers Oleg Zaytsev and Nati Tal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "Free samples, tutorials, kits, even hackers-for-hire – everything needed to construct a complete end-to-end malicious campaign." The company also described Telegram as a "scammers paradise" and a "breeding ground for modern phishing operations." This is not the first time the popular messaging platform has&nbsp; come under the radar &nbsp;for facilitating malicious activities, which are in part driven by its lenient modera

Chinese-speaking users have been targeted by malicious Google ads for restricted messaging apps like Telegram as part of an ongoing malvertising campaign. "The threat actor is abusing Google advertiser accounts to create malicious ads and pointing them to pages where unsuspecting users will download Remote Administration Trojan (RATs) instead," Malwarebytes' Jérôme Segura&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday report. "Such programs give an attacker full control of a victim's machine and the ability to drop additional malware." It's worth noting that the activity, codenamed&nbsp; FakeAPP , is a continuation of a&nbsp; prior attack wave &nbsp;that targeted Hong Kong users searching for messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram on search engines in late October 2023. The latest iteration of the campaign also adds messaging app LINE to the list of messaging apps, redirecting users to bogus websites hosted on Google Docs or Google Sites.

The threat actor tracked as&nbsp; TA866 &nbsp;has resurfaced after a nine-month hiatus with a new large-volume phishing campaign to deliver known malware families such as WasabiSeed and Screenshotter. The campaign, observed earlier this month and blocked by Proofpoint on January 11, 2024, involved sending thousands of invoice-themed emails targeting North America bearing decoy PDF files. "The PDFs contained OneDrive URLs that, if clicked, initiated a multi-step infection chain eventually leading to the malware payload, a variant of the WasabiSeed and Screenshotter custom toolset," the enterprise security firm&nbsp; said . TA866 was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by the company in February 2023, attributing it to a campaign named Screentime that distributed WasabiSeed, a Visual Basic script dropper that's used to download Screenshotter, which is capable of taking screenshots of the victim's desktop at regular intervals of time and exfiltrating that data to an actor-controlled domain.

High-profile individuals working on Middle Eastern affairs at universities and research organizations in Belgium, France, Gaza, Israel, the U.K., and the U.S. have been targeted by an Iranian cyber espionage group called&nbsp; Mint Sandstorm &nbsp;since November 2023. The threat actor "used bespoke phishing lures in an attempt to socially engineer targets into downloading malicious files," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday analysis, describing it as a "technically and operationally mature subgroup of Mint Sandstorm." The attacks, in select cases, involve the use of a previously undocumented backdoor dubbed MediaPl, indicating ongoing endeavors by Iranian threat actors to refine their post-intrusion tradecraft. Mint Sandstorm, also known as APT35, Charming Kitten, TA453, and Yellow Garuda, is&nbsp; known &nbsp;for its&nbsp; adept social engineering campaigns , even resorting to legitimate but compromised accounts to send bespoke phishing emails to prospective

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are resorting to YouTube videos featuring content related to cracked software in order to entice users into downloading an information stealer malware called Lumma. "These YouTube videos typically feature content related to cracked applications, presenting users with similar installation guides and incorporating malicious URLs often shortened using services like TinyURL and Cuttly," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday analysis. This is not the first time pirated software videos on YouTube have emerged as an effective bait for stealer malware. Previously&nbsp; similar attack chains &nbsp;were&nbsp; observed &nbsp;delivering stealers, clippers, and crypto miner malware. In doing so, threat actors can leverage the compromised machines for not only information and cryptocurrency theft, but also abuse the resources for illicit mining. In the latest attack sequence documented by Fortinet, users searching for cracked versions of legitimate video editing tools like

The threat actor known as UAC-0050 is leveraging phishing attacks to distribute Remcos RAT using new strategies to evade detection from security software. "The group's weapon of choice is Remcos RAT, a notorious malware for remote surveillance and control, which has been at the forefront of its espionage arsenal," Uptycs security researchers Karthickkumar Kathiresan and Shilpesh Trivedi&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report. "However, in their latest operational twist, the UAC-0050 group has integrated a pipe method for&nbsp; interprocess communication , showcasing their advanced adaptability." UAC-0050, active since 2020, has a&nbsp; history &nbsp;of targeting Ukrainian and Polish entities via social engineering campaigns that impersonate legitimate organizations to trick recipients into opening malicious attachments. In February 2023, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) attributed the adversary to a phishing campaign designed to deliver Remcos RAT. Over t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are warning about an increase in phishing attacks that are capable of draining cryptocurrency wallets. "These threats are unique in their approach, targeting a wide range of blockchain networks, from Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain to Polygon, Avalanche, and almost 20 other networks by using a crypto wallet-draining technique," Check Point researchers Oded Vanunu, Dikla Barda, and Roman Zaikin&nbsp; said . A prominent contributor to this troubling trend is a notorious phishing group called Angel Drainer, which advertises a "scam-as-a-service" offering by charging a percentage of the stolen amount,&nbsp; typically 20% or 30% , from its collaborators in return for providing wallet-draining scripts and other services. In late November 2023, a similar wallet-draining service known as Inferno Drainer announced that it was&nbsp; shutting down its operations &nbsp;for good after helping scammers plunder over $70 million worth of crypto from 103,676 victims sinc

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Nation-state actors affiliated to North Korea have been observed using spear-phishing attacks to deliver an assortment of backdoors and tools such as AppleSeed, Meterpreter, and TinyNuke to seize control of compromised machines. South Korea-based cybersecurity company AhnLab attributed the activity to an advanced persistent threat group known as&nbsp; Kimsuky . "A notable point about attacks that use AppleSeed is that similar methods of attack have been used for many years with no significant changes to the malware that are used together," the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published Thursday. Kimsuky , active for over a decade, is known for its targeting of a wide range of entities in South Korea, before expanding its focus to include other geographies in 2017. It was&nbsp; sanctioned &nbsp;by the U.S. government late last month for amassing intelligence to support North Korea's strategic objectives. The threat actor's espionage campaigns are realized th

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor referred to as&nbsp; Cloud Atlas &nbsp;has been linked to a set of spear-phishing attacks on Russian enterprises. Targets included a Russian agro-industrial enterprise and a state-owned research company, according to a&nbsp; report &nbsp;from F.A.C.C.T., a standalone cybersecurity company formed after Group-IB's formal exit from Russia earlier this year. Cloud Atlas, active since at least 2014, is a cyber espionage group of unknown origin. Also called Clean Ursa, Inception, Oxygen, and Red October, the threat actor is known for its persistent campaigns targeting Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Slovenia. In December 2022, Check Point and Positive Technologies&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;multi-stage attack sequences that led to the deployment of a PowerShell-based backdoor referred to as PowerShower as well as DLL payloads capable of communicating with an actor-controlled server.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing campaign is leveraging decoy Microsoft Word documents as bait to deliver a backdoor written in the&nbsp; Nim programming language . "Malware written in uncommon programming languages puts the security community at a disadvantage as researchers and reverse engineers' unfamiliarity can hamper their investigation," Netskope researchers Ghanashyam Satpathy and Jan Michael Alcantara&nbsp; said . Nim-based malware has been a rarity in the threat landscape, although that has been slowly changing in recent years as attackers continue to either develop custom tools from scratch using the language or port existing versions of their nefarious programs to it. This has been demonstrated in the case of loaders such as&nbsp; NimzaLoader ,&nbsp; Nimbda ,&nbsp; IceXLoader , as well as ransomware families tracked under the names&nbsp; Dark Power &nbsp;and&nbsp; Kanti .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Attackers are weaponizing an old Microsoft Office vulnerability as part of phishing campaigns to distribute a strain of malware called&nbsp; Agent Tesla . The infection chains leverage decoy Excel documents attached in invoice-themed messages to trick potential targets into opening them and activate the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 (CVSS score: 7.8), a memory corruption vulnerability in Office's Equation Editor that could result in code execution with the privileges of the user. The findings, which come from Zscaler ThreatLabz, build on prior reports from Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, which detailed a&nbsp; similar phishing campaign &nbsp;that exploited the security flaw to deliver the malware. "Once a user downloads a malicious attachment and opens it, if their version of Microsoft Excel is vulnerable, the Excel file initiates communication with a malicious destination and proceeds to download additional files without requiring any further user interaction," security researcher Kaiva

The malware loader known as PikaBot is being distributed as part of a&nbsp; malvertising &nbsp; campaign &nbsp;targeting users searching for legitimate software like AnyDesk.

The malware family, which&nbsp; first &nbsp; appeared &nbsp;in early 2023, consists of a loader and a core module that allows it to operate as a backdoor as well as a distributor for other payloads. This&nbsp; enables &nbsp;the threat actors to gain unauthorized remote access to compromised systems and transmit commands from a command-and-control (C2) server, ranging from arbitrary shellcode, DLLs, or executable files, to other malicious tools such as Cobalt Strike.

A phishing campaign has been observed delivering an information stealer malware called&nbsp; MrAnon Stealer &nbsp;to unsuspecting victims via seemingly benign booking-themed PDF lures. "This malware is a Python-based information stealer compressed with cx-Freeze to evade detection," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said .

There is evidence to suggest that Germany is the primary target of the attack as of November 2023, owing to the number of times the downloader URL hosting the payload has been queried. Masquerading as a company looking to book hotel rooms, the phishing email bears a PDF file that, upon opening, activates the infection by prompting the recipient to download an updated version of Adobe Flash. Doing so results in the execution of .NET executables and PowerShell scripts to ultimately run a pernicious Python script, which i

Microsoft has warned of a new wave of CACTUS ransomware attacks that leverage malvertising lures to deploy DanaBot as an initial access vector.

DanaBot , tracked by the tech giant as Storm-1044, is a multi-functional tool along the lines of Emotet, TrickBot, QakBot, and IcedID that's capable of acting as a stealer and a point of entry for next-stage payloads. UNC2198, for its part, has been previously observed infecting endpoints with IcedID to deploy ransomware families such as Maze and Egregor, as&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;by Google-owned Mandiant in February 2021.

Account credentials, a popular initial access vector, have become a valuable commodity in cybercrime. As a result, a single set of stolen credentials can put your organization's entire network at risk. According to the&nbsp; 2023 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report , external parties were responsible for&nbsp; 83 percent &nbsp;of breaches that occurred between November 2021 and October 2022.&nbsp; Forty-nine percent &nbsp;of those breaches involved stolen credentials. How are threat actors compromising credentials? Social engineering is one of the&nbsp; top five cybersecurity threats &nbsp;in 2023. Phishing, which accounts for %of social engineering attempts, is the go-to method for stealing credentials. It's a relatively cheap tactic that yields results. As phishing and social engineering techniques become more sophisticated and the tools become more readily available, credential theft should become a top security concern for all organizations if it already isn't one.

Once aspiring Neanderthals are recruited via advertisements on underground forums, they are invited to join designated Telegram channels that are used for communicating with other Neanderthals and keeping track of transaction logs. The ultimate goal of the operation is to pull off one of the three types of scams: seller, buyer, or refund.

Konni Group Using Russian-Language Malicious Word Docs in Latest Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/konni-group-using-russian-language.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing attack has been observed leveraging a Russian-language Microsoft Word document to deliver malware capable of harvesting sensitive information from compromised Windows hosts. The activity has been attributed to a threat actor called Konni , which is assessed to share overlaps with a North Korean cluster tracked as Kimsuky (aka APT43). "This campaign relies on a remote access trojan (RAT) capable of extracting information and executing commands on compromised devices," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published this week. The&nbsp; cyber espionage &nbsp; group &nbsp;is notable for its&nbsp; targeting of Russia , with the modus operandi involving the use of spear-phishing emails and malicious documents as entry points for their attacks. Recent attacks documented by Knowsec and ThreatMon have leveraged the&nbsp; WinRAR vulnerability &nbsp;(CVE-2023-38831) as well as obfuscated Visual Basic scripts to drop&nbsp; Konni RAT &nbsp;and a Windows Batch script capable of

Phishing attacks are steadily becoming more sophisticated, with cybercriminals investing in new ways of deceiving victims into revealing sensitive information or installing malicious software. One of the latest trends in phishing is the use of QR codes, CAPTCHAs, and steganography. See how they are carried out and learn to detect them. Quishing Quishing, a phishing technique resulting from the combination of "QR" and "phishing," has become a popular weapon for cybercriminals in 2023. By concealing malicious links within QR codes, attackers can evade traditional spam filters, which are primarily geared towards identifying text-based phishing attempts. The inability of many security tools to decipher the content of QR codes further makes this method a go-to choice for cybercriminals. An email containing a QR code with a malicious link Analyzing a QR code with an embedded malicious link in a safe environment is easy with&nbsp; ANY.RUN : Simply open&nbsp; this task &nbsp;in th

Android smartphone users in India are the target of a new malware campaign that employs social engineering lures to install fraudulent apps that are capable of harvesting sensitive data. "Using social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, attackers are sending messages designed to lure users into installing a malicious app on their mobile device by impersonating legitimate organizations, such as banks, government services, and utilities," Microsoft threat intelligence researchers Abhishek Pustakala, Harshita Tripathi, and Shivang Desai&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday analysis. The ultimate goal of the operation is to capture banking details, payment card information, account credentials, and other personal data. The attack chains involve sharing malicious APK files via social media messages sent on WhatsApp and Telegram by falsely presenting them as banking apps and inducing a sense of urgency by claiming that the targets' bank accounts will be blocked unless they update their permanent a

Phishing campaigns delivering malware families such as DarkGate and PikaBot are following the same tactics previously used in attacks leveraging the now-defunct QakBot trojan. "These include hijacked email threads as the initial infection, URLs with unique patterns that limit user access, and an infection chain nearly identical to what we have seen with QakBot delivery," Cofense&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The malware families used also follow suit to what we would expect QakBot affiliates to use." QakBot, also called QBot and Pinkslipbot, was&nbsp; shut down &nbsp;as part of a coordinated law enforcement effort codenamed Operation Duck Hunt earlier this August. The use of DarkGate and PikaBot in these campaigns is not surprising as they can both act as conduits to deliver additional payloads to compromised hosts, making them both an attractive option for cybercriminals. PikaBot's parallels to QakBot were&nbsp; previously highlighted &nbsp;by Zscaler in its analysis of the malw

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are leveraging manipulated search results and bogus Google ads that trick users who are looking to download legitimate software such as WinSCP into installing malware instead. Cybersecurity company Securonix is tracking the ongoing activity under the name&nbsp; SEO#LURKER . "The malicious advertisement directs the user to a compromised WordPress website gameeweb[.]com, which redirects the user to an attacker-controlled phishing site," security researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The threat actors are believed to leverage Google's Dynamic Search Ads ( DSAs ), which automatically generates ads based on a site's content to serve the malicious ads that take the victims to the infected site. The ultimate goal of the complex multi-stage attack chain is to entice users into clicking on the fake, lookalike WinSCP website, winccp[.]net, and download the malware.

Malaysian law enforcement authorities have&nbsp; announced &nbsp;the takedown of a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) operation called&nbsp; BulletProofLink . The Royal Malaysia Police said the effort, which was carried out with assistance from the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on November 6, 2023, was based on information that the threat actors behind the platform were based out of the country. To that end, eight individuals aged between 29 and 56, including the syndicate's mastermind, have been arrested across different locations in Sabah, Selangor, Perak, and Kuala Lumpur, New Straits Times&nbsp; reported . Along with the arrests, authorities confiscated servers, computers, jewelry, vehicles, and cryptocurrency wallets containing approximately $213,000.

Sapphire Sleet, also called APT38, BlueNoroff, CageyChameleon, and CryptoCore, has a track record of orchestrating cryptocurrency theft via social engineering. Earlier this week, Jamf Threat Labs implicated the threat actor to a new macOS malware family called&nbsp; ObjCShellz &nbsp;that's assessed to be a late-stage payload delivered in connection with another macOS malware known as RustBucket.

Senior executives working in U.S.-based organizations are being targeted by a new phishing campaign that leverages a popular adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing toolkit named&nbsp; EvilProxy &nbsp;to conduct credential harvesting and account takeover attacks.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new threat actor known as&nbsp; AtlasCross &nbsp;has been observed leveraging Red Cross-themed phishing lures to deliver two previously undocumented backdoors named DangerAds and AtlasAgent. NSFOCUS Security Labs&nbsp; described &nbsp;the adversary as having a "high technical level and cautious attack attitude," adding that "the phishing attack activity captured this time is part of the attacker's targeted strike on specific targets and is its main means to achieve in-domain penetration." The attack chains start with a macro-laced Microsoft document that purports to be about a blood donation drive from the American Red Cross that, when launched, runs the malicious macro to set up persistence, exfiltrate system metadata to a remote server (data.vectorse[.]com) that's a sub-domain of a legitimate website belonging to a structural and engineering firm based in the U.S. It also extracts a file named KB4495667.pkg (codenamed DangerAds), which, subsequently acts as a loader to

Ukrainian military entities are the target of a phishing campaign that leverages drone manuals as lures to deliver a Go-based open-source post-exploitation toolkit called Merlin. "Since drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been an integral tool used by the Ukrainian military, malware-laced lure files themed as UAVs service manuals have begun to surface," Securonix researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company is tracking the campaign under the name&nbsp; STARK#VORTEX . The starting point of the attack is a Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) file that, when opened, runs malicious JavaScript embedded inside one of the HTML pages to execute PowerShell code designed to contact a remote server to fetch an obfuscated binary. The Windows-based payload is decoded to extract the&nbsp; Merlin Agent , which, in turn, is configured to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server for post-exploita

Chinese-language speakers have been increasingly targeted as part of multiple email phishing campaigns that aim to distribute various malware families such as Sainbox RAT, Purple Fox, and a new trojan called ValleyRAT. "Campaigns include Chinese-language lures and malware typically associated with Chinese cybercrime activity," enterprise security firm Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The activity, observed since early 2023, entails sending email messages containing URLs pointing to compressed executables that are responsible for installing the malware. Other infection chains have been found to leverage Microsoft Excel and PDF attachments that embed these URLs to trigger malicious activity. These campaigns demonstrate variation in the use of infrastructure, sender domains, email content, targeting, and payloads, indicating that different threat clusters are mounting the attacks.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning of a new phishing campaign undertaken by an initial access broker that involves using Teams messages as lures to infiltrate corporate networks. The tech giant's Threat Intelligence team is tracking the cluster under the name&nbsp; Storm-0324 , which is also known by the monikers TA543 and Sagrid. "Beginning in July 2023, Storm-0324 was observed distributing payloads using an open-source tool to send phishing lures through Microsoft Teams chats," the company&nbsp; said , adding the development marks a shift from using email-based initial infection vectors for initial access. Storm-0324 operates in the cybercriminal economy as a payload distributor, offering a service that allows for the propagation of&nbsp; various &nbsp; payloads &nbsp;using evasive infection chains. This includes a mix of downloaders, banking trojans, ransomware, and modular toolkits such as Nymaim, Gozi, TrickBot, IcedID, Gootkit, Dridex, Sage, GandCrab, and JSSLoader.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A sophisticated phishing campaign is using a Microsoft Word document lure to distribute a trifecta of threats, namely Agent Tesla, OriginBotnet, and OriginBotnet, to gather a wide range of information from compromised Windows machines. "A phishing email delivers the Word document as an attachment, presenting a deliberately blurred image and a counterfeit reCAPTCHA to lure the recipient into clicking on it," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . Clicking on the image leads to the delivery of a loader from a remote server that, in turn, is designed to distribute OriginBotnet for keylogging and password recovery, RedLine Clipper for cryptocurrency theft, and Agent Tesla for harvesting sensitive information. The loader, written in .NET, employs a technique called binary padding by adding null bytes to increase the file's size to 400 MB in an attempt to evade detection by security software.

A new phishing attack is leveraging Facebook Messenger to propagate messages with malicious attachments from a "swarm of fake and hijacked personal accounts" with the ultimate goal of taking over the targets' accounts.

In these attacks, dubbed MrTonyScam, potential victims are sent messages that entice them into clicking on the RAR and ZIP archive attachments, leading to the deployment of a dropper that fetches the next-stage from a GitHub or GitLab repository.

A new malvertising campaign has been observed distributing an updated version of a macOS stealer malware called&nbsp; Atomic Stealer &nbsp;(or AMOS), indicating that it's being actively maintained by its author. An off-the-shelf Golang malware available for $1,000 per month, Atomic Stealer&nbsp; first came &nbsp;to light in April 2023.

The Iranian threat actor tracked as APT34 has been linked to a new phishing attack that leads to the deployment of a variant of a backdoor called&nbsp; SideTwist .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing attack likely targeting civil society groups in South Korea has led to the discovery of a novel remote access trojan called&nbsp; SuperBear . The intrusion singled out an unnamed activist, who was contacted in late August 2023 and received a malicious LNK file from an address impersonating a member of the organization, non-profit entity Interlabs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. The LNK file, upon execution, launches a PowerShell command to execute a Visual Basic script that, in turn, fetches the next-stage payloads from a legitimate but compromised WordPress website. This includes the Autoit3.exe binary ("solmir.pdb") and an AutoIt script ("solmir_1.pdb") that's launched using the former. The AutoIt script, for its part, performs process injection using a&nbsp; process hollowing technique , in which malicious code is inserted into a process that's in a suspended state.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning of an increase in adversary-in-the-middle ( AiTM ) phishing techniques, which are being propagated as part of the phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) cybercrime model. In addition to an uptick in AiTM-capable PhaaS platforms, the tech giant noted that existing phishing services like PerSwaysion are incorporating AiTM capabilities. "This development in the PhaaS ecosystem enables attackers to conduct high-volume phishing campaigns that attempt to circumvent MFA protections at scale," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). Phishing kits with AiTM capabilities work in two ways, one of which concerns the use of reverse proxy servers (i.e., the phishing page) to relay traffic to and from the client and legitimate website and stealthily capture user credentials, two-factor authentication codes, and session cookies. A second method involves synchronous relay servers. "In AiTM through synchronous relay s

An ongoing campaign targeting ministries of foreign affairs of NATO-aligned countries points to the involvement of Russian threat actors.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are increasingly using a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit dubbed EvilProxy to pull off account takeover attacks aimed at high-ranking executives at prominent companies. According to Proofpoint, an ongoing hybrid campaign has leveraged the service to target thousands of Microsoft 365 user accounts, sending approximately 120,000 phishing emails to hundreds of organizations worldwide between March and June 2023. Nearly 39% of the hundreds of compromised users are said to be C-level executives, including CEOs (9%) and CFOs (17%). The attacks have also singled out personnel with access to financial assets or sensitive information. At least 35% of all compromised users had additional account protections enabled. The campaigns are seen as a response to the increased adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in enterprises, prompting threat actors to evolve their tactics to bypass new security layers by incorporating adversary-in-the-middle ( AitM ) phishing kits to

Microsoft on Wednesday disclosed that it identified a set of highly targeted social engineering attacks mounted by a Russian nation-state threat actor using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats. The tech giant attributed the attacks to a group it tracks as&nbsp; Midnight Blizzard &nbsp;(previously Nobelium). It's also called APT29, BlueBravo, Cozy Bear, Iron Hemlock, and The Dukes. "In this latest activity, the threat actor uses previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities," the company&nbsp; said . "Using these domains from compromised tenants, Midnight Blizzard leverages Teams messages to send lures that attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and eliciting approval of multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A sophisticated Facebook phishing campaign has been observed exploiting a zero-day flaw in Salesforce's email services, allowing threat actors to craft targeted phishing messages using the company's domain and infrastructure. "Those phishing campaigns cleverly evade conventional detection methods by chaining the Salesforce vulnerability and legacy quirks in Facebook's Web Games platform," Guardio Labs researchers Oleg Zaytsev and Nati Tal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The email messages masquerade as coming from Meta, while being sent from an email address with a "@salesforce.com" domain. They seek to trick recipients into clicking on a link by claiming that their Facebook accounts are undergoing a "comprehensive investigation" due to "suspicions of engaging in impersonation." The goal is to direct users to a rogue landing page that's designed to capture the victim's account credentials and two-factor aut

An ongoing cyber attack campaign has set its sights on Korean-speaking individuals by employing U.S. Military-themed document lures to trick them into running malware on compromised systems. Cybersecurity firm Securonix is tracking the activity under the name&nbsp; STARK#MULE . "Based on the source and likely targets, these types of attacks are on par with past attacks stemming from typical North Korean groups such as APT37 as South Korea has historically been a primary target of the group, especially its government officials," security researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov said in a report shared with The Hacker News. APT37, also known by the names Nickel Foxcroft, Reaper, Ricochet Chollima, and ScarCruft, is a&nbsp; North Korean nation-state actor &nbsp;that's known to exclusively focus on targets in its southern counterpart, specifically those involved in reporting on North Korea and supporting defectors.

A new malvertising campaign has been observed leveraging ads on Google Search and Bing to target users seeking IT tools like AnyDesk, Cisco AnyConnect VPN, and WinSCP, and trick them into downloading trojanized installers with an aim to breach enterprise networks and likely carry out future ransomware attacks.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have issued a warning about an emerging and advanced form of voice phishing ( vishing ) known as " Letscall ." This technique is currently targeting individuals in South Korea. The criminals behind "Letscall" employ a multi-step attack to deceive victims into downloading malicious apps from a counterfeit Google Play Store website. Once the malicious software is installed, it redirects incoming calls to a call center under the control of the criminals. Trained operators posing as bank employees then extract sensitive information from unsuspecting victims. To facilitate the routing of voice traffic, "Letscall" utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as voice over IP (VOIP) and WebRTC. It also makes use of Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) and Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) protocols, including Google STUN servers, to ensure high-quality phone or video calls and bypass NAT and firewall restrictions.

MULTI#STORM Campaign Targets India and U.S. with Remote Access Trojans<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/multistorm-campaign-targets-india-and.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing campaign codenamed&nbsp; MULTI#STORM &nbsp;has set its sights on India and the U.S. by leveraging JavaScript files to deliver remote access trojans on compromised systems. "The attack chain ends with the victim machine infected with multiple unique RAT (remote access trojan) malware instances, such as Warzone RAT and Quasar RAT," Securonix researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov&nbsp; said . "Both are used for command-and-control during different stages of the infection chain." The multi-stage attack chain commences when an email recipient clicks the embedded link pointing to a password-protected ZIP file ("REQUEST.zip") hosted on Microsoft OneDrive with the password "12345." Extracting the archive file reveals a heavily obfuscated JavaScript file ("REQUEST.js") that, when double clicked, activates the infection by executing two PowerShell commands that are responsible for retrieving two separate payloads from OneDri

Microsoft Uncovers Banking AitM Phishing and BEC Attacks Targeting Financial Giants<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/microsoft-uncovers-banking-aitm.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Banking and financial services organizations are the targets of a new multi-stage adversary-in-the-middle ( AitM ) phishing and business email compromise (BEC) attack, Microsoft has revealed. "The attack originated from a compromised trusted vendor and transitioned into a series of AiTM attacks and follow-on BEC activity spanning multiple organizations," the tech giant&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a Thursday report. Microsoft, which is tracking the cluster under its emerging moniker&nbsp; Storm-1167 , called out the group's use of indirect proxy to pull off the attack. This enabled the attackers to flexibly tailor the phishing pages to their targets and carry out session cookie theft, underscoring the continued sophistication of AitM attacks. The modus operandi is unlike other AitM campaigns where the decoy pages act as a&nbsp; reverse proxy &nbsp;to harvest credentials and time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) entered by the victims.

</p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Thousands of adware apps for Android have been found to masquerade as cracks or modded versions of popular apps to redirect users to serve unwanted ads to users as part of a campaign ongoing since October 2022. "The campaign is designed to aggressively push adware to Android devices with the purpose to drive revenue," Bitdefender said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. "However, the threat actors involved can easily switch tactics to&nbsp; redirect users to other types of malware such as banking Trojans to steal credentials and financial information or ransomware." The Romanian cybersecurity company said it has discovered 60,000 unique apps carrying the adware, with a majority of the detections located in the U.S., South Korea, Brazil, Germany, the U.K., France, Kazakhstan, Romania, and Italy. It's worth pointing out that none of the apps are distributed through the official Google Play Store. Instead, users searching for apps like Netflix, PDF

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese-speaking phishing gang dubbed&nbsp; PostalFurious &nbsp;has been linked to a new SMS campaign that's targeting users in the U.A.E. by masquerading as postal services and toll operators, per Group-IB. The fraudulent scheme entails sending users bogus text messages asking them to pay a vehicle trip fee to avoid additional fines. The messages also contain a shortened URL to conceal the actual phishing link. Clicking on the link directs the unsuspecting recipients to a fake landing page that's designed to capture payment credentials and personal data. The campaign is estimated to be active as of April 15, 2023. "The URLs from the texts lead to fake branded payment pages that ask for personal details, such as name, address, and credit card information," Group-IB&nbsp; said . "The phishing pages appropriate the official name and logo of the impersonated postal service provider." The exact scale of the attacks is currently unknown. What's known is that the tex

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing technique called "file archiver in the browser" can be leveraged to "emulate" a file archiver software in a web browser when a victim visits a .ZIP domain. "With this phishing attack, you simulate a file archiver software (e.g., WinRAR) in the browser and use a .zip domain to make it appear more legitimate," security researcher mr.d0x&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;last week. Threat actors, in a nutshell, could create a realistic-looking&nbsp; phishing landing page &nbsp;using HTML and CSS that mimics legitimate file archive software, and host it on a .zip domain, thus elevating&nbsp; social engineering campaigns . In a potential attack scenario, a miscreant could resort to such trickery to redirect users to a credential harvesting page when a file "contained" within the fake ZIP archive is clicked. "Another interesting use case is listing a non-executable file and when the user clicks to initiate a download, it downloads an executable file," mr.d0x

It has been active since at least 2009, targeting media, governments, and military entities for espionage. The latest intrusion set, starting in early February 2023, involved the use of reflected cross-site scripting ( XSS ) attacks in various Ukrainian government websites to redirect users to phishing domains and capture their credentials.

In yet another sign that Telegram is increasingly becoming a&nbsp; thriving hub &nbsp;for cybercrime, researchers have found that threat actors are using the messaging platform to peddle phishing kits and help set up phishing campaigns. "To promote their 'goods,' phishers create Telegram channels through which they educate their audience about phishing and entertain subscribers with polls like, 'What type of personal data do you prefer?'," Kaspersky web content analyst Olga Svistunova&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. The links to these Telegram channels are distributed via YouTube, GitHub, and the phishing kits that are developed by the crooks themselves. The Russian cybersecurity firm said it detected over 2.5 million malicious URLs generated using phishing kits in the past six months. One of the prominent services offered is to provide threat actors with Telegram bots that automate the process of generating phishing pages and collecting user data. Although

FakeCalls Vishing Malware Targets South Korean Users via Popular Financial Apps<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/fakecalls-vishing-malware-targets-south.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Android voice phishing (aka vishing) malware campaign known as FakeCalls has reared its head once again to target South Korean users under the guise of over 20 popular financial apps. "FakeCalls malware possesses the functionality of a Swiss army knife, able not only to conduct its primary aim but also to extract private data from the victim's device," cybersecurity firm Check Point said . FakeCalls was previously documented by Kaspersky in April 2022, describing the malware's capabilities to imitate phone conversations with a bank customer support agent. In the observed attacks, users who install the rogue banking app are enticed into calling the financial institution by offering a fake low-interest loan. At the point where the phone call actually happens, a pre-recorded audio with instructions from the real bank is played. Simultaneously, the malware conceals the phone number with the bank's legitimate number to give the impression that a conversation

Copycat websites for instant messaging apps like Telegram and WhatApp are being used to distribute trojanized versions and infect Android and Windows users with cryptocurrency clipper malware . "All of them are after victims' cryptocurrency funds, with several targeting cryptocurrency wallets," ESET researchers Lukáš Štefanko and Peter Strýček said in a new analysis. While the first instance of clipper malware on the Google Play Store dates back to 2019, the development marks the first time Android-based clipper malware has been built into instant messaging apps. "Moreover, some of these apps use optical character recognition (OCR) to recognize text from screenshots stored on the compromised devices, which is another first for Android malware," the Slovak cybersecurity firm added. The attack chain begins with unsuspecting users clicking on fraudulent ads on Google search results that lead to hundreds of sketchy YouTube channels, which then direct them

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An open source adversary-in-the-middle ( AiTM ) phishing kit has found a number of takers in the cybercrime world for its ability to orchestrate attacks at scale. Microsoft Threat Intelligence is tracking the threat actor behind the development of the kit under its emerging moniker&nbsp; DEV-1101 . An&nbsp; AiTM phishing attack &nbsp;typically involves a threat actor attempting to steal and intercept a target's password and session cookies by deploying a proxy server between the user and the website. Such attacks are more effective owing to their ability to circumvent multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections. DEV-1101, per the tech giant, is said to be the party behind several phishing kits that can be purchased or rented by other criminal actors, thereby reducing the effort and resources required to launch a phishing campaign. "The availability of such phishing kits for purchase by attackers is part of the industrialization of the cybercriminal economy and lowers the barrier of

In what's a continuing assault on the open source ecosystem,&nbsp; over 15,000 spam packages &nbsp;have flooded the npm repository in an attempt to distribute phishing links.

Hackers Using Google Ads to Spread FatalRAT Malware Disguised as Popular Apps<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/hackers-using-google-ads-to-spread.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Chinese-speaking individuals in Southeast and East Asia are the targets of a new rogue Google Ads campaign that delivers remote access trojans such as FatalRAT to compromised machines. The attacks involve purchasing ad slots to appear in Google search results that direct users searching for popular applications to rogue websites hosting trojanized installers, ESET said in a report published today. The ads have since been taken down. Some of the spoofed applications include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Telegram, WhatsApp, LINE, Signal, Skype, Electrum, Sogou Pinyin Method, Youdao, and WPS Office. "The websites and installers downloaded from them are mostly in Chinese and in some cases falsely offer Chinese language versions of software that is not available in China," the Slovak cybersecurity firm&nbsp; said , adding it observed the attacks between August 2022 and January 2023. A majority of the victims are located in Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong, followed by Malaysia, Japa

Massive Ad Fraud Scheme Targeted Over 11 Million Devices with 1,700 Spoofed Apps<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/massive-ad-fraud-scheme-targeted-over.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have shut down an "expansive" ad fraud scheme that spoofed more than 1,700 applications from 120 publishers and impacted roughly 11 million devices.&nbsp; "VASTFLUX was a malvertising attack that injected malicious JavaScript code into digital ad creatives, allowing the fraudsters to stack numerous invisible video ad players behind one another and register ad views," fraud prevention firm HUMAN&nbsp; said . The operation gets its name from the use of a DNS evasion technique called&nbsp; Fast Flux &nbsp;and&nbsp; VAST , a Digital Video Ad Serving Template that's employed to serve ads to video players. The sophisticated operation particularly exploited the restricted in-app environments that run ads on iOS to place bids for displaying ad banners. Should the auction be won, the hijacked ad slot is leveraged to inject rogue JavaScript that establishes contact with a remote server to retrieve the list of apps to be targeted. This includes the&nbsp; bundle IDs &nbsp;that belong to leg

RedZei Chinese Scammers Targeting Chinese Students in the U.K.<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/redzei-chinese-scammers-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Chinese international students in the U.K. have been targeted by persistent Chinese-speaking scammers for over a year as part of an activity dubbed&nbsp; RedZei &nbsp;(aka RedThief). "The RedZei fraudsters have chosen their targets carefully, researched them and realized it was a rich victim group that is ripe for exploitation," cybersecurity researcher Will Thomas (@BushidoToken)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published last week. The most notable aspect about the operation is the steps taken by the threat actors to bypass steps taken by users to prevent scam calls, using a new pay-as-you-go U.K. phone number for each wave so as to render phone number-based blocking ineffective. Thomas, pointing out the meticulous tradecraft employed by the scammers, said the threat actor alternates between SIMs from several mobile carriers such as Three, O2, EE, Tesco Mobile, and Telia. Indications are that the lucrative RedZei campaign may have started as far back as August 2019, with a report from The

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A China-based financially motivated group is leveraging the trust associated with popular international brands to orchestrate a large-scale phishing campaign dating back as far as 2019.  The threat actor, dubbed Fangxiao by Cyjax, is said to have registered over&nbsp; 42,000 imposter domains , with initial activity observed in 2017.  "It targets businesses in multiple verticals including retail, banking, travel, and energy," researchers Emily Dennison and Alana Witten&nbsp; said . "Promised financial or physical incentives are used to trick victims into further spreading the campaign via WhatsApp."  Users clicking on a link sent through the messaging app are directed to an actor-controlled site, which, in turn, sends them to a landing domain impersonating a well-known brand, from where the victims are once again taken to sites distributing fraudulent apps and bogus rewards.   These sites prompt the visitors to complete a survey to claim cash prizes, in exchange for which the

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform known as&nbsp; Robin Banks &nbsp;has relocated its attack infrastructure to DDoS-Guard, a Russian provider of bulletproof hosting services.  The switch comes after "Cloudflare disassociated Robin Banks phishing infrastructure from its services, causing a multi-day disruption to operations," according to a&nbsp; report &nbsp;from cybersecurity company IronNet.  Robin Banks was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;in July 2022 when the platform's abilities to offer ready-made phishing kits to criminal actors were revealed, making it possible to steal the financial information of customers of popular banks and other online services.  It was also found to prompt users to enter Google and Microsoft credentials on rogue landing pages, suggesting an attempt on part of the malware authors to monetize initial access to corporate networks for post-exploitation activities such as espionage and ransomware.   In recent months, Cloudflare's decision to blocklist its infrastruct

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors are resorting to voice phishing (vishing) tactics to dupe victims into installing Android malware on their devices, new research  from ThreatFabric reveals.  The Dutch mobile security company said it identified a network of phishing websites targeting Italian online-banking users that are designed to get hold of their contact details.  Telephone-oriented attack delivery (TOAD), as the social engineering technique is called, involves calling the victims using previously collected information from fraudulent websites.  The caller, who purports to be a support agent for the bank, instructs the individual, on the other hand, to install a security app and grant it extensive permissions, when, in reality, it's malicious software intended to gain remote access or conduct financial fraud.   In this case, it leads to the deployment of an Android malware dubbed&nbsp; Copybara , a mobile trojan first detected in November 2021 and is primarily used to perform on-device fraud via o

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind the BazaCall call back phishing method have continued to evolve with updated social engineering tactics to deploy malware on targeted networks.  The scheme eventually acts as an entry point to conduct financial fraud or the delivery of next-stage payloads such as ransomware, cybersecurity company Trellix&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.  Primary targets of the latest attack waves include the U.S., Canada, China, India, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and the U.K.   BazaCall , also called BazarCall, first gained popularity in 2020 for its novel approach of distributing the BazarBackdoor (aka BazarLoader) malware by manipulating potential victims into calling a phone number specified in decoy email messages.  These email baits aim to create a false sense of urgency, informing the recipients about renewal of a trial subscription for, say, an antivirus service. The messages also urge them to contact their support desk to cancel the plan, or risk getting automat

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cyber criminals are using a previously undocumented phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit called&nbsp; Caffeine &nbsp;to effectively scale up their attacks and distribute nefarious payloads.  "This platform has an intuitive interface and comes at a relatively low cost while providing a multitude of features and tools to its criminal clients to orchestrate and automate core elements of their phishing campaigns," Mandiant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.  Some of the core features offered by the platform comprise the ability to craft customized phishing kits, manage redirect pages, dynamically generate URLs that host the payloads, and track the success of the campaigns.   The development comes a little over a month after Resecurity took the wraps off another PhaaS service dubbed&nbsp; EvilProxy &nbsp;that's offered for sale on dark web criminal forums.  But unlike EvilProxy, whose operators are known to vet prospective customers before activating the subscriptions, Caffeine is notable for running an o

A popular Chinese-language YouTube channel has emerged as a means to distribute a trojanized version of a Windows installer for the Tor Browser.  Kaspersky&nbsp; dubbed &nbsp;the campaign&nbsp; OnionPoison , with all of the victims located in China. The scale of the attack remains unclear, but the Russian cybersecurity company said it detected victims appearing in its telemetry in March 2022.  The malicious version of the Tor Browser installer is being distributed via a link present in the description of a video that was uploaded to YouTube on January 9, 2022. It has been viewed over 64,500 times to date.   The channel hosting the video has 181,000 subscribers and claims to be based in Hong Kong. The video is still available to watch on the social media platform as of writing.  The attack banks on the fact that the actual Tor Browser website is blocked in China, thus tricking unsuspecting users searching for "Tor浏览器" (i.e., Tor Browser in Chinese) on YouTube into potentially downloading th

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
GitHub has put out an advisory detailing what may be an ongoing phishing campaign targeting its users to steal credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes by impersonating the CircleCI DevOps platform.  The Microsoft-owned code hosting service said it learned of the attack on September 16, 2022, adding the campaign impacted "many victim organizations."  The fraudulent messages claim to notify users that their CircleCI sessions have expired and that they should log in using GitHub credentials by clicking on a link.   Another bogus email&nbsp; revealed by CircleCI &nbsp;prompts users to sign in to their GitHub accounts to accept the company's new Terms of Use and Privacy Policy by following the link embedded in the message.  Regardless of the lure, doing so redirects the target to a lookalike GitHub login page designed to steal and exfiltrate the entered credentials as well as the Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) codes in real-time to the attacker, effectively allowing

Microsoft said it's tracking an ongoing large-scale click fraud campaign targeting gamers by means of stealthily deployed browser extensions on compromised systems.  "[The] attackers monetize clicks generated by a browser node-webkit or malicious browser extension secretly installed on devices," Microsoft Security Intelligence said  in a sequence of tweets over the weekend.  The tech giant's cybersecurity division is tracking the developing threat cluster under the name DEV-0796.   Attach chains mounted by the adversary commence with an ISO file that's downloaded onto a victim's machine upon clicking on a malicious ad or comments on YouTube. The ISO file, when opened, is designed to install a browser node-webkit (aka&nbsp; NW.js ) or rogue browser extension.   It's worth noting that the&nbsp; ISO file &nbsp;masquerades as hacks and cheats for the Krunker first-person shooter game.

New EvilProxy Phishing Service Allowing Cybercriminals to Bypass 2-Factor Security<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/new-evilproxy-phishing-service-allowing.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit dubbed EvilProxy is being advertised on the criminal underground as a means for threat actors to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) protections employed against online services.  "EvilProxy actors are using reverse proxy and cookie injection methods to bypass 2FA authentication – proxifying victim's session," Resecurity researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday write-up.   The platform generates phishing links that are nothing but cloned pages designed to compromise user accounts associated with Apple iCloud, Facebook, GoDaddy, GitHub, Google, Dropbox, Instagram, Microsoft, NPM, PyPI, RubyGems, Twitter, Yahoo, and Yandex, among others.  EvilProxy is similar to adversary-in-the-middle ( AiTM ) attacks in that users interact with a malicious proxy server that acts as a&nbsp;go-between for the target website, covertly harvesting the credentials and 2FA passcodes entered in the login pages.  It's offered on a subscription basis per service

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More details have emerged about the operators behind the&nbsp; first-known phishing campaign &nbsp;specifically aimed at the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official third-party software repository for the programming language.  Connecting it to a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; JuiceLedger , cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, along with Checkmarx, described the group as a relatively new entity that surfaced in early 2022.  Initial "low-key" campaigns are said to have involved the use of rogue Python installer applications to deliver a .NET-based malware called JuiceStealer that's engineered to siphon passwords and other sensitive data from victims' web browsers.   The attacks received a significant facelift last month when the JuiceLedger actors&nbsp; targeted PyPi package contributors &nbsp;in a phishing campaign, resulting in the compromise of three packages with malware.

"This is the first known phishing attack against PyPI," the maintainers of the official third-party software repository&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets.  The social engineering attack entails sending security-themed messages that create a false sense of urgency by informing recipients that Google is implementing a mandatory validation process on all packages and that they need to click on a link to complete the validation before September, or risk getting their PyPI modules removed.   Should an unsuspecting developer fall for the scheme, users are directed to a lookalike landing page that mimics PyPI's login page and is hosted on Google Sites, from where the entered credentials are captured and abused to unauthorizedly access the accounts and compromise the packages to include malware

A sophisticated scam-as-a-service operation dubbed Classiscam  has now infiltrated into Singapore, more than 1.5 years after&nbsp; expanding to Europe .  "Scammers posing as legitimate buyers approach sellers with the request to purchase goods from their listings and the ultimate aim of stealing payment data," Group-IB&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The cybersecurity firm called the operators a "well-coordinated and technologically advanced scammer criminal network."  Classiscam refers to a&nbsp; Russia-based cybercrime operation &nbsp;that was first recorded in summer 2019 but only came under spotlight a year later coinciding with a surge in activity owing to an increase in online shopping in the aftermath of COVID-19 outbreak.

Researchers Warns of Increase in Phishing Attacks Using Decentralized IPFS Network<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/researchers-warns-of-increase-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The decentralized file system solution known as IPFS is becoming the new "hotbed" for hosting phishing sites, researchers have warned.  Cybersecurity firm Trustwave SpiderLabs, which disclosed specifics of the attack campaigns, said it identified no less than 3,000 emails containing IPFS phishing URLs as an attack vector in the last three months.  IPFS , short for InterPlanetary File System, is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to store and share files and data using cryptographic hashes, instead of URLs or filenames, as is observed in a traditional client-server approach. Each hash forms the basis for a unique content identifier ( CID ).  The idea is to create a resilient distributed file system that allows data to be stored across multiple computers. This would allow information to be accessed without having to rely on third parties such as cloud storage providers, effectively making it resistant to censorship.   "Taking down phishing content stored on IPFS can be difficul

Microsoft on Tuesday disclosed that a large-scale phishing campaign targeted over 10,000 organizations since September 2021 by hijacking Office 365's authentication process even on accounts secured with multi-factor authentication (MFA).  "The attackers then used the stolen credentials and session cookies to access affected users' mailboxes and perform follow-on business email compromise (BEC) campaigns against other targets," the company's cybersecurity teams&nbsp; reported .  The intrusions entailed setting up adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing sites, wherein the adversary deploys a proxy server between a potential victim and the targeted website so that recipients of a phishing email are redirected to lookalike landing pages designed to capture credentials and MFA information.  "The phishing page has two different Transport Layer Security (TLS) sessions — one with the target and another with the actual website the target wants to access," the company

Hackers Hijack Email Reply Chains on Unpatched Exchange Servers to Spread Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/hackers-hijack-email-reply-chains-on.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new email phishing campaign has been spotted leveraging the tactic of conversation hijacking to deliver the IcedID info-stealing malware  onto infected&nbsp;machines by making use of unpatched and publicly-exposed Microsoft Exchange servers.  "The emails use a social engineering technique of conversation hijacking (also known as thread hijacking)," Israeli company Intezer said in a report  shared with The Hacker News. "A forged reply to a previous stolen email is being used as a way to convince the recipient to open the attachment. This is notable because it increases the credibility of the phishing email and may cause a high infection rate."  The latest wave of attacks, detected in mid-March 2022, is said to have targeted organizations within energy, healthcare, law, and pharmaceutical sectors.   IcedID, aka BokBot, like its counterparts TrickBot and&nbsp; Emotet , is a&nbsp; banking trojan &nbsp;that has evolved to become an entry point for more sophisticated threats, including hu

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A novel phishing technique called browser-in-the-browser (BitB) attack can be exploited to simulate a browser window within the browser in order to spoof a legitimate domain, thereby making it possible to stage convincing phishing attacks.  According to penetration tester and security researcher, who goes by the handle mrd0x_, the method takes advantage of third-party single sign-on ( SSO ) options embedded on websites such as "Sign in with Google" (or Facebook, Apple, or Microsoft).   While the default behavior when a user attempts to sign in via these methods is to be greeted by a pop-up window to complete the authentication process, the BitB attack aims to replicate this entire process using a mix of HTML and CSS code to create an entirely fabricated browser window.   "Combine the window design with an iframe pointing to the malicious server hosting the phishing page, and it's basically indistinguishable," mrd0x_&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published last

Social engineering attacks leveraging a combination of romantic lures and cryptocurrency fraud have been luring unsuspecting victims into installing fake apps by taking advantage of legitimate iOS features like TestFlight and Web Clips.

"This style of cyber-fraud, known as sha zhu pan (杀猪盘) — literally 'pig butchering plate' — is a well-organized, syndicated scam operation that uses a combination of often romance-centered social engineering and fraudulent financial applications and websites to ensnare victims and steal their savings after gaining their confidence," Sophos analyst Jagadeesh Chandraiah&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.

A broad range of threat actors, including Fancy Bear, Ghostwriter, and Mustang Panda, have launched phishing campaigns against Ukraine, Poland, and other European entities amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) said it took down two Blogspot domains that were used by the nation-state group FancyBear (aka APT28) – which is attributed to Russia's GRU military intelligence – as a landing page for its social engineering attacks.  The disclosure comes close on the heels of an advisory from the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA)&nbsp; warning &nbsp;of phishing campaigns targeting Ukr.net users that involve sending messages from compromised accounts containing links to attacker-controlled credential harvesting pages.  Another cluster of threat activity concerns webmail users of Ukr.net, Yandex.ru, wp.pl, rambler.ru, meta.ua, and i.ua, who have been at the receiving end of phishing attacks by a Belarusian threat actor tracked as Ghostwrit

Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) warned of new phishing attacks aimed at its citizens by leveraging compromised email accounts belonging to three different Indian entities with the goal of compromising their inboxes and stealing sensitive information.  The agency&nbsp; cautioned &nbsp;that the emails arrive with the subject line "Увага" (meaning "Attention") and claim to be from a domestic email service called Ukr.net, when in actuality, the email address of the sender is "muthuprakash.b@tvsrubber[.]com."  The messages purportedly warn the recipients of an unauthorized attempt to log in to their accounts from an IP address based out of the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, further prompting them to click on a link to change their passwords with immediate effect.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
No fewer than 1,220 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) phishing websites have been discovered as targeting popular online services like Instagram, Google, PayPal, Apple, Twitter, and LinkedIn with the goal of hijacking users' credentials and carrying out further follow-on attacks.  The findings come from a&nbsp; new study &nbsp;undertaken by a group of researchers from Stony Brook University and Palo Alto Networks, who have demonstrated a new fingerprinting technique that makes it possible to identify MitM phishing kits in the wild by leveraging their intrinsic network-level properties, effectively automating the discovery and analysis of phishing websites.  Dubbed " PHOCA " — named after the Latin word for "seals" — the tool not only facilitates the discovery of previously unseen MitM phishing toolkits, but also be used to detect and isolate malicious requests coming from such servers.

Microsoft on Thursday disclosed an "extensive series of credential phishing campaigns" that takes advantage of a custom phishing kit that stitched together components from at least five different widely circulated ones with the goal of siphoning user login information.  The tech giant's Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team, which detected the first instances of the tool in the wild in December 2020, dubbed the copy-and-paste attack infrastructure " TodayZoo ."   "The abundance of phishing kits and other tools available for sale or rent makes it easy for a lone wolf attacker to pick and choose the best features from these kits," the researchers said. "They put these functionalities together in a customized kit and try to reap the benefits all to themselves. Such is the case of TodayZoo."

Phony Call Centers Tricking Users Into Installing Ransomware and Data-Stealers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/phony-call-centers-tricking-users-into.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing malicious campaign that employs phony call centers has been found to trick victims into downloading malware capable of data exfiltration as well as deploying ransomware on infected systems.  The attacks — dubbed "BazaCall" — eschew traditional social engineering techniques that rely on rogue URLs and malware-laced documents in favor of a vishing-like method wherein targeted users are sent email messages informing them of a forthcoming subscription charge unless they call a specific phone number.  By tricking the recipients into calling the number, the unsuspecting victims are connected with an actual human operator at a fraudulent call center, who then provide them with instructions to download the BazaLoader malware.   BazaLoader&nbsp;(aka BazarBackdoor) is a C++-based downloader with the ability to install various types of malicious programs on infected computers, including deploying ransomware and other malware to steal sensitive data from victimized systems.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An evolving phishing campaign observed at least since May 2020 has been found to target high-ranking company executives across manufacturing, real estate, finance, government, and technological sectors with the goal of obtaining sensitive information.

"The attackers target high profile employees who may not be as technically or cybersecurity savvy, and may be more likely to be deceived into clicking on malicious links," Trend Micro researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday analysis.
