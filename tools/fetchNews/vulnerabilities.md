<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind the Mispadu banking Trojan have become the latest to exploit a now-patched Windows SmartScreen security bypass flaw to compromise users in Mexico. The attacks entail a new variant of the malware that was first observed in 2019, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said in a report published last week. Propagated via phishing mails, Mispadu is a Delphi-based information stealer known to specifically infect victims in the Latin American (LATAM) region. In March 2023, Metabase Q&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that Mispadu spam campaigns harvested no less than 90,000 bank account credentials since August 2022. It's also part of the larger family of LATAM banking malware, including&nbsp; Grandoreiro , which was dismantled by Brazilian law enforcement authorities last week. The latest infection chain identified by Unit 42 employs rogue internet shortcut files contained within bogus ZIP archive files that leverage CVE-2023-36025 (CVSS score: 8.8), a high-severity bypass flaw in Windows Smar

A now-patched security flaw in Microsoft Outlook could be exploited by threat actors to access NT LAN Manager (NTLM) v2 hashed passwords when opening a specially crafted file. The issue, tracked as CVE-2023-35636 (CVSS score: 6.5), was addressed by the tech giant as part of its&nbsp; Patch Tuesday updates &nbsp;for December 2023. "In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file," Microsoft&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory released last month. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability." Put differently, the adversary would have to convince users to click a link, either embedded in a phishing email or sent via an instant message, and then deceive them into opening the file in question.

Cisco has released patches to address a critical security flaw impacting Unified Communications and Contact Center Solutions products that could permit an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2024-20253 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.9), the issue stems from improper processing of user-provided data that a threat actor could abuse to send a specially crafted message to a listening port of a susceptible appliance. "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the web services user," Cisco&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "With access to the underlying operating system, the attacker could also establish root access on the affected device." Synacktiv security researcher Julien Egloff has been credited with discovering and reporting CVE-2024-20253.

The maintainers of the open-source continuous integration/continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD) automation software Jenkins have resolved nine security flaws, including a critical bug that, if successfully exploited, could result in remote code execution (RCE). The issue, assigned the CVE identifier&nbsp; CVE-2024-23897 , has been described as an arbitrary file read vulnerability through the built-in command line interface ( CLI ) "Jenkins uses the args4j library to parse command arguments and options on the Jenkins controller when processing CLI commands," the maintainers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday advisory. "This command parser has a feature that replaces an @ character followed by a file path in an argument with the file's contents (expandAtFiles). This feature is enabled by default and Jenkins 2.441 and earlier, LTS 2.426.2 and earlier does not disable it."

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a loophole impacting Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) that could be potentially exploited by threat actors with a Google account to take control of a Kubernetes cluster. The critical shortcoming has been codenamed Sys:All by cloud security firm Orca. As many as 250,000 active GKE clusters in the wild are estimated to be susceptible to the attack vector. In a report shared with The Hacker News, security researcher Ofir Yakobi said it "stems from a likely widespread misconception that the system:authenticated group in Google Kubernetes Engine includes only verified and deterministic identities, whereas in fact, it includes any Google authenticated account (even outside the organization)." The system:authenticated group is a special group that includes all authenticated entities, counting human users and service accounts.

The vulnerability in question is&nbsp; CVE-2023-51467 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), a bypass for another severe shortcoming in the same software ( CVE-2023-49070 , CVSS score: 9.8) that could be weaponized to bypass authentication and remotely execute arbitrary code. While it was fixed in&nbsp; Apache OFbiz version 18.12.11 &nbsp;released last month, threat actors have been observed attempting to exploit the flaw, targeting vulnerable instances. The latest findings from VulnCheck show that CVE-2023-51467 can be exploited to execute a payload directly from memory, leaving little to no traces of malicious activity. Security flaws disclosed in Apache OFBiz (e.g.,&nbsp; CVE-2020-9496 ) have been&nbsp; exploited &nbsp;by threat actors in the past, including by threat actors associated with th

A security flaw has been disclosed in Kyocera's&nbsp; Device Manager &nbsp;product that could be exploited by bad actors to carry out malicious activities on affected systems. "This vulnerability allows attackers to coerce authentication attempts to their own resources, such as a malicious SMB share, to capture or relay Active Directory hashed credentials if the 'Restrict NTLM: Outgoing NTLM traffic to remote servers' security policy is not enabled," Trustwave&nbsp; said . Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-50916 , Kyocera, in an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;released late last month, described it as a path traversal issue that enables an attacker to intercept and alter a local path pointing to the backup location of the database to a universal naming convention (UNC) path. This, in turn, causes the web application to attempt to authenticate the rogue UNC path, resulting in unauthorized access to clients' accounts and data theft. Furthermore, depending on the configuration of the environment, it could be exploited to

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ivanti has released security updates to address a critical flaw impacting its Endpoint Manager (EPM) solution that, if successfully exploited, could result in remote code execution (RCE) on susceptible servers. Tracked as CVE-2023-39336, the vulnerability has been rated 9.6 out of 10 on the CVSS scoring system. The shortcoming impacts EPM 2021 and EPM 2022 prior to SU5. "If exploited, an attacker with access to the internal network can leverage an unspecified SQL injection to execute arbitrary SQL queries and retrieve output without the need for authentication," Ivanti&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "This can then allow the attacker control over machines running the EPM agent. When the core server is configured to use SQL express, this might lead to RCE on the core server." The disclosure arrived weeks after the company&nbsp; resolved &nbsp;nearly two dozen security flaws in its Avalanche enterprise mobile device management (MDM) solution. Of the 21 issues, 13 are rated critical (CVSS scores: 9.8

SMTP Smuggling: New Flaw Lets Attackers Bypass Security and Spoof Emails<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/01/smtp-smuggling-new-threat-enables.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new exploitation technique called Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ( SMTP ) smuggling can be weaponized by threat actors to send spoofed emails with fake sender addresses while bypassing security measures. "Threat actors could abuse vulnerable SMTP servers worldwide to send malicious emails from arbitrary email addresses, allowing targeted phishing attacks," Timo Longin, a senior security consultant at SEC Consult,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last month. SMTP is a TCP/IP protocol used to send and receive email messages over a network. To relay a message from an email client (aka mail user agent), an SMTP connection is established between the client and server in order to transmit the actual content of the email. The server then relies on what's called a mail transfer agent (MTA) to check the domain of the recipient's email address, and if it's different from that of the sender, it queries the domain name system (DNS) to look up the&nbsp; MX (mail exchanger) rec

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers from Ruhr University Bochum have discovered a vulnerability in the Secure Shell ( SSH ) cryptographic network protocol that could allow an attacker to downgrade the connection's security by breaking the integrity of the secure channel. Called&nbsp; Terrapin &nbsp;( CVE-2023-48795 , CVSS score: 5.9), the exploit has been described as the "first ever practically exploitable prefix truncation attack." "By carefully adjusting the sequence numbers during the handshake, an attacker can remove an arbitrary amount of messages sent by the client or server at the beginning of the secure channel without the client or server noticing it," researchers Fabian Bäumer, Marcus Brinkmann, and Jörg Schwenk&nbsp; said . SSH is a&nbsp; method &nbsp;for securely sending commands to a computer over an unsecured network. It relies on cryptography to authenticate and encrypt connections between devices. This is accomplished by means of a handshake in which a client and server agree up

Microsoft on Thursday said it's once again disabling the&nbsp; ms-appinstaller protocol handler &nbsp;by default following its abuse by multiple threat actors to distribute malware. "The observed threat actor activity abuses the current implementation of the ms-appinstaller protocol handler as an access vector for malware that may lead to ransomware distribution," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team&nbsp; said . It further noted that several cybercriminals are offering a malware kit for sale as a service that leverages the MSIX file format and ms-appinstaller protocol handler. The&nbsp; changes &nbsp;have gone into effect in App Installer version 1.21.3421.0 or higher. The attacks take the form of signed malicious MSIX application packages that are distributed via Microsoft Teams or malicious advertisements for legitimate popular software on search engines like Google.

Google Cloud Resolves Privilege Escalation Flaw Impacting Kubernetes Service<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/google-cloud-resolves-privilege.html"> Full Text</a>

Google Cloud has addressed a medium-severity security flaw in its platform that could be abused by an attacker who already has access to a Kubernetes cluster to escalate their privileges. "An attacker who has compromised the&nbsp; Fluent Bit &nbsp;logging container could combine that access with high privileges required by&nbsp; Anthos Service Mesh &nbsp;(on clusters that have enabled it) to escalate privileges in the cluster," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;as part of an advisory released on December 14, 2023. Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, which discovered and reported the shortcoming, said adversaries could weaponize it to carry out "data theft, deploy malicious pods, and disrupt the cluster's operations." There is no evidence that the issue has been exploited in the wild. It has been addressed in the following versions of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Anthos Service Mesh (ASM) - 1.25.16-gke.1020000 1.26.10-gke.1235000 1.27.7-gke.1293000 1.28.4-gke.1083000 1.17.8-asm.8 1.18.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new zero-day security flaw has been discovered in Apache OfBiz, an open-source Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that could be exploited to bypass authentication protections. The vulnerability, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-51467 , resides in the login functionality and is the result of an incomplete patch for another critical vulnerability ( CVE-2023-49070 , CVSS score: 9.8) that was released earlier this month.

New Security Vulnerabilities Uncovered in pfSense Firewall Software - Patch Now<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/new-security-vulnerabilities-uncovered.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the open-source Netgate pfSense firewall solution called pfSense that could be chained by an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on susceptible appliances. The issues relate to two reflected cross-site scripting ( XSS ) bugs and one command injection flaw, according to new findings from Sonar. "Security inside a local network is often more lax as network administrators trust their firewalls to protect them from remote attacks," security researcher Oskar Zeino-Mahmalat&nbsp; said . "Potential attackers could have used the discovered vulnerabilities to spy on traffic or attack services inside the local network." Impacting pfSense CE 2.7.0 and below and pfSense Plus 23.05.1 and below, the shortcomings could be weaponized by tricking an authenticated pfSense user (i.e., an admin user) into clicking on a specially crafted URL, which contains an XSS payload that activates command injection.

SLAM Attack: New Spectre-based Vulnerability Impacts Intel, AMD, and Arm CPUs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/slam-attack-new-spectre-based.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam have disclosed a new side-channel attack called&nbsp; SLAM &nbsp;that could be exploited to leak sensitive information from kernel memory on current and upcoming CPUs from Intel, AMD, and Arm. The attack is an end-to-end exploit for Spectre based on a new feature in Intel CPUs called&nbsp; Linear Address Masking &nbsp;( LAM ) as well as its analogous counterparts from AMD (called&nbsp; Upper Address Ignore &nbsp;or&nbsp; UAI ) and Arm (called&nbsp; Top Byte Ignore &nbsp;or&nbsp; TBI ). "SLAM exploits unmasked gadgets to let a userland process leak arbitrary ASCII kernel data," VUSec researchers&nbsp; said , adding it could be leveraged to leak the root password hash within minutes from kernel memory. While LAM is presented as a security feature, the study found that it ironically degrades security and "dramatically" increases the&nbsp; Spectre attack surface , resulting in a transient execution attack, which exploits&nbsp; speculative execution &nbsp;to extract sensitive data via

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors can take advantage of Amazon Web Services Security Token Service (AWS STS) as a way to infiltrate cloud accounts and conduct follow-on attacks. The service enables threat actors to impersonate user identities and roles in cloud environments, Red Canary researchers Thomas Gardner and Cody Betsworth&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. AWS STS is a&nbsp; web service &nbsp;that enables users to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for users to access AWS resources without needing to create an AWS identity. These STS tokens can be valid&nbsp; anywhere from 15 minutes to 36 hours . Threat actors can steal long-term IAM tokens through a variety of methods like malware infections, publicly exposed credentials, and phishing emails, subsequently using them to determine roles and privileges associated with those tokens via API calls. "Depending on the token's permission level, adversaries may also be able to use it to create additional IAM users with long-term AKIA tokens to e

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new "post-exploitation tampering technique" can be abused by malicious actors to visually deceive a target into believing that their Apple iPhone is running in Lockdown Mode when it's actually not and carry out covert attacks. The novel method, detailed by Jamf Threat Labs in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News, "shows that if a hacker has already infiltrated your device, they can cause Lockdown Mode to be 'bypassed' when you trigger its activation." In other words, the goal is to implement Fake Lockdown Mode on a device that's compromised by an attacker through other means, such as&nbsp; unpatched security flaws &nbsp;that can trigger execution of arbitrary code. Lockdown Mode , introduced by Apple last year with iOS 16, is an&nbsp; enhanced security measure &nbsp;that aims to safeguard high-risk individuals from sophisticated digital threats such as mercenary spyware by&nbsp; minimizing the attack surface .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has unearthed multiple novel attacks that break Bluetooth Classic's forward secrecy and future secrecy guarantees, resulting in adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) scenarios between two already connected peers. The issues, collectively named&nbsp; BLUFFS , impact Bluetooth Core Specification 4.2 through 5.4. They are tracked under the identifier&nbsp; CVE-2023-24023 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.8) and were responsibly disclosed in October 2022. The attacks "enable device impersonation and machine-in-the-middle across sessions by only compromising one session key," EURECOM researcher Daniele Antonioli said in a study published late last month. This is made possible by leveraging two new flaws in the Bluetooth standard's session key derivation mechanism that allow the derivation of the same key across sessions. While forward secrecy in key-agreement cryptographic protocols ensures that past communications are not revealed, even if the private keys to a particular exchange are re

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) code from various independent firmware/BIOS vendors (IBVs) has been found vulnerable to potential attacks through high-impact flaws in image parsing libraries embedded into the firmware. The shortcomings, collectively labeled&nbsp; LogoFAIL &nbsp;by Binarly, "can be used by threat actors to deliver a malicious payload and bypass Secure Boot, Intel Boot Guard, and other security technologies by design." Furthermore, they can be weaponized to bypass security solutions and deliver persistent malware to compromised systems during the boot phase by injecting a malicious logo image file into the&nbsp; EFI system partition . While the issues are not silicon-specific, meaning they impact both x86 and ARM-based devices, they are also UEFI and IBV-specific. The vulnerabilities comprise a heap-based buffer overflow flaw and an out-of-bounds read, details of which are expected to be made public later this week at the&nbsp; Black Hat Europe conference .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a case of "forced authentication" that could be exploited to leak a Windows user's NT LAN Manager (NTLM) tokens by tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted Microsoft Access file. The attack takes advantage of a legitimate feature in the database management system solution that allows users to&nbsp; link to external data sources , such as a remote SQL Server table. "This feature can be abused by attackers to automatically leak the Windows user's NTLM tokens to any attacker-controlled server, via any TCP port, such as port 80," Check Point security researcher Haifei Li&nbsp; said . "The attack can be launched as long as the victim opens an .accdb or .mdb file. In fact, any more-common Office file type (such as a .rtf ) can work as well." NTLM, an authentication protocol introduced by Microsoft in 1993, is a challenge-response protocol that's used to authenticate users during sign-in. Over the years,

Experts Uncover Passive Method to Extract Private RSA Keys from SSH Connections<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/experts-uncover-passive-method-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new study has demonstrated that it's possible for passive network attackers to obtain private RSA host keys from a vulnerable SSH server by observing when naturally occurring computational faults that occur while the connection is being established. The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol is a method for securely transmitting commands and logging in to a computer over an unsecured network. Based on a client-server architecture, SSH uses cryptography to authenticate and encrypt connections between devices. A host key is a cryptographic key used for authenticating computers in the SSH protocol. Host keys are key pairs that are typically generated using public-key cryptosystems like RSA . "If a signing implementation using CRT-RSA has a fault during signature computation, an attacker who observes this signature may be able to compute the signer's private key," a group of academics from the University of California, San Diego, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology said

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new research has uncovered multiple vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass&nbsp; Windows Hello authentication &nbsp;on Dell Inspiron 15, Lenovo ThinkPad T14, and Microsoft Surface Pro X laptops. The flaws were discovered by researchers at hardware and software product security and offensive research firm Blackwing Intelligence, who found the weaknesses in the fingerprint sensors from Goodix, Synaptics, and ELAN that are embedded into the devices. A prerequisite for fingerprint reader exploits is that the users of the targeted laptops have fingerprint authentication already set up. All the fingerprint sensors are a type of sensor called "match on chip" ( MoC ), which integrates the matching and other biometric management functions directly into the sensor's integrated circuit. "While MoC prevents replaying stored fingerprint data to the host for matching, it does not, in itself, prevent a malicious sensor from spoofing a legitimate sensor's communication w

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Bitcoin wallets created between 2011 and 2015 are susceptible to a new kind of exploit called&nbsp; Randstorm &nbsp;that makes it possible to recover passwords and gain unauthorized access to a multitude of wallets spanning several blockchain platforms. "Randstorm() is a term we coined to describe a collection of bugs, design decisions, and API changes that, when brought in contact with each other, combine to dramatically reduce the quality of random numbers produced by web browsers of a certain era (2011-2015)," Unciphered&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a report published last week. It's estimated that approximately 1.4 million bitcoins are parked in wallets that were generated with potentially weak cryptographic keys. Customers can check whether their wallets are vulnerable at&nbsp;www.keybleed[.]com. The cryptocurrency recovery company said it re-discovered the problem in January 2022 while it was&nbsp; working for an unnamed customer &nbsp;who had been locked out of its Blockchain.com wallet.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A zero-day flaw in the Zimbra Collaboration email software was exploited by four different groups in real-world attacks to pilfer email data, user credentials, and authentication tokens. "Most of this activity occurred after the initial fix became public on GitHub," Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-37580 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.1), is a&nbsp; reflected cross-site scripting &nbsp;(XSS) vulnerability impacting versions before 8.8.15 Patch 41. It was&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;by Zimbra as part of patches released on July 25, 2023. Successful exploitation of the shortcoming could allow execution of malicious scripts on the victims' web browser simply by tricking them into clicking on a specially crafted URL, effectively initiating the XSS request to Zimbra and reflecting the attack back to the user.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A set of novel attack methods has been demonstrated against Google Workspace and the Google Cloud Platform that could be potentially leveraged by threat actors to conduct ransomware, data exfiltration, and password recovery attacks. "Starting from a single compromised machine, threat actors could progress in several ways: they could move to other cloned machines with&nbsp; GCPW &nbsp;installed, gain access to the cloud platform with custom permissions, or decrypt locally stored passwords to continue their attack beyond the Google ecosystem," Martin Zugec, technical solutions director at Bitdefender,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.

A group of academics has disclosed a new "software fault attack" on AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization ( SEV ) technology that could be potentially exploited by threat actors to infiltrate encrypted virtual machines (VMs) and even perform privilege escalation. The attack has been codenamed&nbsp; CacheWarp &nbsp;(CVE-2023-20592) by researchers from the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security. It impacts AMD CPUs supporting all variants of SEV. "For this research, we specifically looked at AMD's newest TEE, AMD SEV-SNP, relying on the experience from previous attacks on Intel's TEE," security researcher Ruiyi Zhang told The Hacker News. "We found the 'INVD' instruction [flush a processor's cache contents] could be abused under the threat model of AMD SEV."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as 34 unique vulnerable Windows Driver Model ( WDM ) and Windows Driver Frameworks ( WDF ) drivers could be exploited by non-privileged threat actors to gain full control of the devices and execute arbitrary code on the underlying systems. "By exploiting the drivers, an attacker without privilege may erase/alter firmware, and/or elevate [operating system] privileges," Takahiro Haruyama, a senior threat researcher at VMware Carbon Black,&nbsp; said . The&nbsp; research &nbsp;expands on previous studies, such as&nbsp; ScrewedDrivers &nbsp;and&nbsp; POPKORN &nbsp;that utilized&nbsp; symbolic execution &nbsp;for automating the discovery of vulnerable drivers. It specifically focuses on drivers that contain firmware access through port I/O and memory-mapped I/O. The names of some of the vulnerable drivers include AODDriver.sys, ComputerZ.sys, dellbios.sys, GEDevDrv.sys, GtcKmdfBs.sys, IoAccess.sys, kerneld.amd64, ngiodriver.sys, nvoclock.sys, PDFWKRNL.sys ( CVE-2023-20598 ), RadHwMgr.sys, rtif.sys, rtport.sys, s

FIRST Announces CVSS 4.0 - New Vulnerability Scoring System<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/first-announces-cvss-40-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) has officially announced&nbsp; CVSS v4.0 , the next generation of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System standard, more than eight years after the release of CVSS v3.0 in June 2015. "This latest version of&nbsp; CVSS 4.0 &nbsp;seeks to provide the highest fidelity of vulnerability assessment for both industry and the public," FIRST&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. CVSS essentially provides a way to capture the principal technical characteristics of a security vulnerability and produce a numerical score denoting its severity. The score can be translated into various levels, such as low, medium, high, and critical, to help organizations prioritize their vulnerability management processes. One of the core updates to CVSS v3.1,&nbsp; released &nbsp;in July 2019, was to&nbsp; emphasize and clarify &nbsp;that "CVSS is designed to measure the severity of a vulnerability and should not be used alone to assess risk." CVSS v3.1 has also&nbsp; attracted criticis

Cybersecurity researchers are warning of suspected exploitation of a recently disclosed critical security flaw in the Apache ActiveMQ open-source message broker service that could result in remote code execution. "In both instances, the adversary attempted to deploy ransomware binaries on target systems in an effort to ransom the victim organizations," cybersecurity firm Rapid7&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a report published Wednesday. "Based on the ransom note and available evidence, we attribute the activity to the HelloKitty ransomware family, whose source code was leaked on a forum in early October." The intrusions are said to involve the exploitation of&nbsp; CVE-2023-46604 , a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ that allows a threat actor to run arbitrary shell commands. It's worth noting that the&nbsp; vulnerability &nbsp;carries a CVSS score of 10.0, indicating maximum severity. It has been&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;in ActiveMQ versions 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, or 5.18.3

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two critical security flaws discovered in the open-source&nbsp; CasaOS &nbsp;personal cloud software could be successfully exploited by attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution and take over susceptible systems. The vulnerabilities, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-37265 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-37266 , both carry a CVSS score of 9.8 out of a maximum of 10. Sonar security researcher Thomas Chauchefoin, who discovered the bugs,&nbsp; said &nbsp;they "allow attackers to get around authentication requirements and gain full access to the CasaOS dashboard." Even more troublingly, CasaOS' support for third-party applications could be weaponized to run arbitrary commands on the system to gain persistent access to the device or pivot into internal networks.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco has warned of a critical, unpatched security flaw impacting IOS XE software that's under active exploitation in the wild. Rooted in the web UI feature, the zero-day vulnerability is tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-20198 &nbsp;and has been assigned the maximum severity rating of 10.0 on the CVSS scoring system. It's worth pointing out that the shortcoming only affects enterprise networking gear that have the Web UI feature enabled and when it's exposed to the internet or to untrusted networks. "This vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to create an account on an affected system with privilege&nbsp; level 15 access ," Cisco&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday advisory. "The attacker can then use that account to gain control of the affected system." The problem impacts both physical and virtual devices running Cisco IOS XE software that also have the HTTP or HTTPS server feature enabled. As a mitigation, it's recommended to disable the HTTP server feature on internet-facing systems. The network

Researcher Reveals New Techniques to Bypass Cloudflare's Firewall and DDoS Protection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/10/researcher-reveal-new-technique-to.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Firewall and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack prevention mechanisms in Cloudflare can be circumvented by exploiting gaps in cross-tenant security controls, defeating the very purpose of these safeguards, it has emerged. "Attackers can utilize their own Cloudflare accounts to abuse the per-design trust-relationship between Cloudflare and the customers' websites, rendering the protection mechanism ineffective," Certitude researcher Stefan Proksch&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. The problem, per the Austrian consulting firm, is the result of shared infrastructure available to all tenants within Cloudflare, regardless of whether they are legitimate or otherwise, thereby making it easy for malicious actors to abuse the implicit trust associated with service and defeat the guardrails. The first issue stems from opting for a shared Cloudflare certificate to authenticate HTTP(S) requests between the service's reverse proxies and the customer's origi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A high-severity security flaw has been disclosed in the open-source OpenRefine data cleanup and transformation tool that could result in arbitrary code execution on affected systems. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-37476 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), the vulnerability is a Zip Slip vulnerability that could have adverse impacts when importing a specially crafted project in versions 3.7.3 and below. "Although OpenRefine is designed to only run locally on a user's machine, an attacker can trick a user into importing a malicious project file," Sonar security researcher Stefan Schiller&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "Once this file is imported, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine." Software prone to&nbsp; Zip Slip vulnerabilities &nbsp;can pave the way for code execution by taking advantage of a directory traversal bug that an attacker can exploit to gain access to parts of the file system that should be out of reach otherwise.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco is warning of attempted exploitation of a security flaw in its IOS Software and IOS XE Software that could permit an authenticated remote attacker to achieve remote code execution on affected systems. The medium-severity vulnerability is tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-20109 , and has a CVSS score of 6.6. It impacts all versions of the software that have the GDOI or G-IKEv2 protocol enabled. The company&nbsp; said &nbsp;the shortcoming "could allow an authenticated, remote attacker who has administrative control of either a group member or a key server to execute arbitrary code on an affected device or cause the device to crash." It further noted that the issue is the result of insufficient validation of attributes in the Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) and G-IKEv2 protocols of the GET VPN feature and it could be weaponized by either compromising an installed key server or modifying the configuration of a group member to point to a key server that is controlled by the attacker.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A novel side-channel attack called&nbsp; GPU.zip &nbsp;renders virtually all modern graphics processing units (GPU) vulnerable to information leakage. "This channel exploits an optimization that is data dependent, software transparent, and present in nearly all modern GPUs: graphical data compression," a group of academics from the University of Texas at Austin, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Washington, and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign&nbsp; said . Graphical data compression &nbsp;is a feature in integrated GPUs (iGPUs) that allows for saving memory bandwidth and improving performance when rendering frames, compressing visual data losslessly even when it's not requested by software. The study found that the compression, which happens in various vendor-specific and undocumented ways, induces data-dependent&nbsp; DRAM &nbsp;traffic and cache occupancy that can be measured using a side-channel. "An attacker can exploit the iGPU-based compression channel to perform cro

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has assigned a new CVE identifier for a critical security flaw in the libwebp image library for rendering images in the&nbsp; WebP format &nbsp;that has come under active exploitation in the wild. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-5129 , the issue has been given the maximum severity score of 10.0 on the CVSS rating system. It has been described as an issue rooted in the&nbsp; Huffman coding algorithm &nbsp;- With a specially crafted WebP lossless file, libwebp may write data out of bounds to the heap. The ReadHuffmanCodes() function allocates the HuffmanCode buffer with a size that comes from an array of precomputed sizes: kTableSize. The color_cache_bits value defines which size to use. The kTableSize array only takes into account sizes for 8-bit first-level table lookups but not second-level table lookups. libwebp allows codes that are up to 15-bit (MAX_ALLOWED_CODE_LENGTH). When BuildHuffmanTable() attempts to fill the second-level tables it may write data out-of-bounds. The OOB write to the undersized ar

GitLab has shipped security patches to resolve a critical flaw that allows an attacker to run pipelines as another user. The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-5009 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.6), impacts all versions of GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE) starting from 13.12 and prior to 16.2.7 as well as from 16.3 and before 16.3.4. "It was possible for an attacker to&nbsp; run pipelines &nbsp;as an arbitrary user via scheduled security scan policies," GitLab&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "This was a bypass of&nbsp; CVE-2023-3932 &nbsp;showing additional impact." Successful exploitation of CVE-2023-5009 could allow a threat actor to access sensitive information or leverage the elevated permissions of the impersonated user to modify source code or run arbitrary code on the system, leading to severe consequences. Security researcher Johan Carlsson (aka joaxcar) has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw. CVE-2023-3932 was addressed by GitLab in early August 2023.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has found that close to 12,000 internet-exposed Juniper firewall devices are vulnerable to a recently disclosed remote code execution flaw. VulnCheck, which&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;a new exploit for CVE-2023-36845, said it could be&nbsp; exploited &nbsp;by an "unauthenticated and remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on Juniper firewalls without creating a file on the system." CVE-2023-36845 refers to a&nbsp; medium-severity flaw &nbsp;in the J-Web component of Junos OS that could be weaponized by a threat actor to control certain, important environment variables. It was patched by Juniper Networks last month alongside CVE-2023-36844, CVE-2023-36846, and CVE-2023-36847 in an out-of-cycle update. A subsequent proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit devised by watchTowr combined CVE-2023-36846 and CVE-2023-36845 to upload a PHP file containing malicious shellcode and achieve code execution. The latest exploit, on the other hand, impacts older systems and can be written using a single cURL comma

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A high-severity security flaw has been disclosed in N-Able's Take Control Agent that could be exploited by a local unprivileged attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-27470 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), the&nbsp; issue &nbsp;relates to a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use ( TOCTOU ) race condition vulnerability, which, when successfully exploited, could be leveraged to delete arbitrary files on a Windows system. The security shortcoming, which impacts versions 7.0.41.1141 and prior, has been addressed in version 7.0.43 released on March 15, 2023, following responsible disclosure by Mandiant on February 27, 2023. Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use falls under a category of software flaws wherein a program checks the state of a resource for a specific value, but that value changes before it's actually used, effectively invalidating the results of the check. An exploitation of such a flaw can result in a loss of integrity and trick the program into performing actions that it shouldn't

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Patches have been released to address two new security&nbsp;vulnerabilities in Apache Superset &nbsp;that could be exploited by an attacker to gain remote code execution on affected systems. The update (version 2.1.1) plugs&nbsp; CVE-2023-39265 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-37941 , which make it possible to conduct nefarious actions once a bad actor is able to gain control of Superset's metadata database. Outside of these weaknesses, the latest version of Superset also remediates a separate improper REST API permission issue ( CVE-2023-36388 ) that allows for low-privilege users to carry out server-side request forgery ( SSRF ) attacks. "Superset by design allows privileged users to connect to arbitrary databases and execute arbitrary SQL queries against those databases using the powerful SQLLab interface," Horizon3.ai's Naveen Sunkavally&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up. "If Superset can be tricked into connecting to its own metadata database, an attacker can directly read or write application configuration thr

Google has rolled out monthly security patches for Android to address a number of flaws, including a zero-day bug that it said may have been exploited in the wild. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-35674 , the high-severity vulnerability is described as a case of privilege escalation impacting the&nbsp; Android Framework . "There are indications that CVE-2023-35674 may be under limited, targeted exploitation," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in its Android Security Bulletin for September 2023 without delving into additional specifics. The update also addresses three other privilege escalation flaws in Framework, with the search giant noting that the most severe of these issues "could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed" sans any user interaction. Google said it has further plugged a critical security vulnerability in the System component that could lead to remote code execution without requiring interaction on the part of the victim. "The severity assessment is

Nine security flaws have been disclosed in electric power management products made by Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL). "The most severe of those nine vulnerabilities would allow a threat actor to facilitate remote code execution (RCE) on an engineering workstation," Nozomi Networks&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. The issues, tracked as CVE-2023-34392 and from CVE-2023-31168 through CVE-2023-31175, have CVSS severity scores ranging from 4.8 to 8.8 and impact SEL-5030 acSELeratorQuickSet and SEL-5037 GridConfigurator, which are used to commission, configure, and monitor the devices. Exploitation of CVE-2023-31171 could be achieved by sending a phishing email that tricks a victim engineer into importing a specially crafted configuration file to achieve arbitrary code execution on the engineering workstation running the SEL software. What's more, the shortcoming can be chained with CVE-2023-31175 to obtain administrative privileges on the target workstation. CVE-202

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code has been made available for a recently disclosed and patched critical flaw impacting VMware Aria Operations for Networks (formerly vRealize Network Insight). The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-34039 , is rated 9.8 out of a maximum of 10 for severity and has been described as a case of authentication bypass due to a lack of unique cryptographic key generation. "A malicious actor with network access to Aria Operations for Networks could bypass SSH authentication to gain access to the Aria Operations for Networks CLI," VMware said earlier this week. Summoning Team's Sina Kheirkhah, who published the PoC following an analyzing the patch by VMware, said the root cause can be traced back to a bash script containing a method named refresh_ssh_keys(), which is responsible for overwriting the current SSH keys for the support and ubuntu users in the authorized_keys file.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New findings show that malicious actors could leverage a sneaky malware detection evasion technique and bypass endpoint security solutions by manipulating the Windows Container Isolation Framework. The findings were presented by Deep Instinct security researcher Daniel Avinoam at the&nbsp; DEF CON security conference &nbsp;held earlier this month. Microsoft's&nbsp; container architecture &nbsp;(and by extension,&nbsp; Windows Sandbox ) uses what's called a&nbsp; dynamically generated image &nbsp;to separate the file system from each container to the host and at the same time avoid duplication of system files. It's nothing but an "operating system image that has clean copies of files that can change, but links to files that cannot change that are in the Windows image that already exists on the host," thereby bringing down the overall size for a full OS. "The result is images that contain 'ghost files,' which store no actual data but point to a different volume on the system,"

Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38035 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the issue has been described as a case of authentication bypass impacting versions 9.18 and prior due to what it called an due to an insufficiently restrictive Apache HTTPD configuration. "If exploited, this vulnerability enables an unauthenticated actor to access some sensitive APIs that are used to configure the Ivanti Sentry on the administrator portal (port 8443, commonly MICS)," the company&nbsp; said . "While the issue has a high CVSS score, there is a low risk of exploitation for customers who do not expose port 8443 to the internet." Successful exploitation of the bug could allow an attacker to change configuration, run system commands, or write files onto the system. It's recommen

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; added &nbsp;a critical security flaw in Adobe ColdFusion to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. The vulnerability, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-26359 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), relates to a deserialization flaw present in Adobe ColdFusion 2018 (Update 15 and earlier) and ColdFusion 2021 (Update 5 and earlier) that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user without requiring any interaction. Deserialization &nbsp;(aka unmarshaling) refers to the process of reconstructing a data structure or an object from a byte stream. But when it's performed without validating its source or sanitizing its contents, it can lead to&nbsp; unexpected consequences &nbsp;such as code execution or denial-of-service (DoS). It was&nbsp; patched &nbsp;by Adobe as part of updates issued in March 2023. As of writing, it's immediately not clear how the flaw is being&nbsp; abused in the wil

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A high-severity security flaw has been disclosed in the WinRAR utility that could be potentially exploited by a threat actor to achieve remote code execution on Windows systems. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-40477 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), the vulnerability has been described as a case of improper validation while processing recovery volumes. "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer," the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process." Successful exploitation of the flaw requires user interaction in that the target must be lured into visiting a malicious page or by simply opening a booby-trapped archive file. A security researcher, who goes by the alias goodbyeselene, has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on June 8, 2023. The issue has been address

New LABRAT Campaign Exploits GitLab Flaw for Cryptojacking and Proxyjacking Activities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-labrat-campaign-exploits-gitlab.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new, financially motivated operation dubbed&nbsp; LABRAT &nbsp;has been observed weaponizing a now-patched critical flaw in GitLab as part of a cryptojacking and proxyjacking campaign. "The attacker utilized undetected signature-based tools, sophisticated and stealthy cross-platform malware, command-and-control (C2) tools which bypassed firewalls, and kernel-based rootkits to hide their presence," Sysdig&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Furthermore, the attacker abused a legitimate service,&nbsp; TryCloudflare , to obfuscate their C2 network." Proxyjacking &nbsp;allows the attacker to rent the compromised host out to a proxy network, making it possible to monetize the unused bandwidth. Cryptojacking, on the other hand, refers to the abuse of the system resources to mine cryptocurrency. A notable aspect of the campaign is the use of compiled binaries written in Go and .NET to fly under the radar, with LABRAT also providing backdoor access to the infected systems.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undetected attack method called&nbsp; NoFilter &nbsp;has been found to abuse the Windows Filtering Platform ( WFP ) to achieve privilege escalation in the Windows operating system. "If an attacker has the ability to execute code with admin privilege and the target is to perform&nbsp; LSASS Shtinkering , these privileges are not enough," Ron Ben Yizhak, a security researcher at Deep Instinct, told The Hacker News. "Running as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" is required. The techniques described in this research can escalate from admin to SYSTEM." The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;were presented at the DEF CON security conference over the weekend. The starting point of the&nbsp; research &nbsp;is an in-house tool called RPC Mapper the cybersecurity company used to map remote procedure call ( RPC ) methods, specifically those that invoke&nbsp; WinAPI , leading to the discovery of a method named "BfeRpcOpenToken," which is part of WFP.

New Apple iOS 16 Exploit Enables Stealthy Cellular Access Under Fake Airplane Mode<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-apple-ios-16-exploit-enables.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have documented a novel post-exploit persistence technique on iOS 16 that could be abused to fly under the radar and main access to an Apple device even when the victim believes it is offline. The method "tricks the victim into thinking their device's Airplane Mode works when in reality the attacker (following successful device exploit) has planted an artificial Airplane Mode which edits the UI to display Airplane Mode icon and cuts internet connection to all apps except the attacker application," Jamf Threat Labs researchers Hu Ke and Nir Avraham said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Airplane Mode , as the name implies, allows users to turn off wireless features in their devices, effectively preventing them from connecting to Wi-Fi networks, cellular data, and Bluetooth as well as sending or receiving calls and text messages. The approach devised by Jamf, in a nutshell, provides an illusion to the user that the Airplane Mode is on

The registry boasts 11,829 unique packages and 244,615 packages in total. The issues identified by the cloud security firm have to do with the service's lax policy surrounding package names, lacking protections against typosquatting attacks, as a result enabling attackers to upload malicious PowerShell modules that appear genuine to unsuspecting users

Multiple critical security flaws have been reported in&nbsp; Ivanti Avalanche , an enterprise mobile device management solution that's used by 30,000 organizations. The vulnerabilities, collectively tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-32560 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), are stack-based buffer overflows in Ivanti Avalanche WLAvanacheServer.exe v6.4.0.0. Cybersecurity company Tenable&nbsp; said &nbsp;the shortcomings are the result of buffer overflows arising as a consequence of processing specific data types. An unauthenticated remote attacker can specify a long hex string or long type 9 item to overflow the buffer, it noted. Successful exploitation of both issues could be exploited by a remote adversary to achieve code execution or a system crash. Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities&nbsp; occur when &nbsp;the buffer being overwritten is in the stack, leading to a scenario where program execution can be altered to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

E-commerce sites using Adobe's Magento 2 software are the target of an ongoing campaign that has been active since at least January 2023. The attacks, dubbed&nbsp; Xurum &nbsp;by Akamai, leverage a now-patched critical security flaw ( CVE-2022-24086 , CVSS score: 9.8) in Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source that, if successfully exploited, could lead to arbitrary code execution. "The attacker seems to be interested in payment stats from the orders in the victim's Magento store placed in the past 10 days," Akamai researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week, attributing the campaign to actors of Russian origin. Some of the websites have also been observed to be infected with simple JavaScript-based skimmers that's designed to collect credit card information and transmit it to a remote server.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple security vulnerabilities impacting CyberPower's PowerPanel Enterprise Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) platform and Dataprobe's iBoot Power Distribution Unit (PDU) could be potentially exploited to gain unauthenticated access to these systems and inflict catastrophic damage in target environments. The nine vulnerabilities, from CVE-2023-3259 through CVE-2023-3267, carry severity scores ranging from 6.7 to 9.8, enabling threat actors to shut down entire data centers and compromise data center deployments to steal data or launch massive attacks at a massive scale. "An attacker could chain these vulnerabilities together to gain full access to these systems," Trellix security researchers Sam Quinn, Jesse Chick, and Philippe Laulheret&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Furthermore, both products are vulnerable to remote code injection that could be leveraged to create a backdoor or an entry point to the broader network of connect

Zoom ZTP &amp; AudioCodes Phones Flaws Uncovered, Exposing Users to Eavesdropping<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/zoom-ztp-audiocodes-phones-flaws.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in AudioCodes desk phones and Zoom's Zero Touch Provisioning ( ZTP ) that could be potentially exploited by a malicious attacker to conduct remote attacks. "An external attacker who leverages the vulnerabilities discovered in AudioCodes Ltd.'s desk phones and Zoom's Zero Touch Provisioning feature can gain full remote control of the devices," SySS security researcher Moritz Abrell&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published Friday. The unfettered access could then be weaponized to eavesdrop on rooms or phone calls, pivot through the devices and attack corporate networks, and even build a botnet of infected devices. The research was&nbsp; presented &nbsp;at the Black Hat USA security conference earlier this week. The problems are rooted in Zoom's ZTP, which allows IT administrators to configure VoIP devices in a centralized manner such that it makes it easy for organizations to monitor, troubleshoot and update the devices as

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A high-severity security flaw has been disclosed in the Python URL parsing function that could be exploited to bypass domain or protocol filtering methods implemented with a blocklist, ultimately resulting in arbitrary file reads and command execution. "urlparse has a parsing problem when the entire URL starts with blank characters," the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) said in a Friday advisory. "This problem affects both the parsing of hostname and scheme, and eventually causes any blocklisting methods to fail." The flaw has been assigned the identifier&nbsp; CVE-2023-24329 &nbsp;and carries a CVSS score of 7.5. Security researcher Yebo Cao has been credited with discovering and reporting the issue in August 2022. It has been addressed in the following versions - &gt;= 3.12 3.11.x &gt;= 3.11.4 3.10.x &gt;= 3.10.12 3.9.x &gt;= 3.9.17 3.8.x &gt;= 3.8.17, and&nbsp; 3.7.x &gt;= 3.7.17 urllib.parse &nbsp;is a widely used parsing function that makes it possible to break dow

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Attackers continue to target Microsoft identities to gain access to connected Microsoft applications and federated SaaS applications. Additionally, attackers continue to progress their attacks in these environments, not by exploiting vulnerabilities, but by abusing native Microsoft functionality to achieve their objective. The attacker group Nobelium, linked with the SolarWinds attacks, has been documented using native functionality like the creation of Federated Trusts&nbsp; [1] &nbsp;to enable persistent access to a Microsoft tenant. This article demonstrates an additional native functionality that when leveraged by an attacker enables persistent access to a Microsoft cloud tenant and lateral movement capabilities to another tenant. This attack vector enables an attacker operating in a compromised tenant to abuse a misconfigured Cross-Tenant Synchronization (CTS) configuration and gain access to other connected tenants or deploy a rogue CTS configuration to maintain persistence within the te

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A widely used Chinese language input app for Windows and Android has been found vulnerable to serious security flaws that could allow a malicious interloper to decipher the text typed by users. The findings from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which carried out an analysis of the encryption mechanism used in Tencent's Sogou Input Method , an app that has over 455 million monthly active users across Windows, Android, and iOS. The vulnerabilities are rooted in EncryptWall, the service's custom encryption system, allowing network eavesdroppers to extract the textual content and access sensitive data. "The Windows and Android versions of Sogou Input Method contain vulnerabilities in this encryption system, including a vulnerability to a CBC&nbsp; padding oracle attack , which allow network eavesdroppers to recover the plaintext of encrypted network transmissions, revealing sensitive information including what users have typed," the researchers&nbsp; said .

Users of Metabase, a popular business intelligence and data visualization software package, are being advised to update to the latest version following the discovery of an "extremely severe" flaw that could result in pre-authenticated remote code execution on affected installations. Tracked as CVE-2023-38646 , the issue impacts open-source editions prior to 0.46.6.1 and Metabase Enterprise versions before 1.46.6.1. "An unauthenticated attacker can run arbitrary commands with the same privileges as the Metabase server on the server you are running Metabase on," Metabase said in an advisory released last week. The issue has also been addressed in the following older versions - 0.45.4.1 and 1.45.4.1 0.44.7.1 and 1.44.7.1, and 0.43.7.2 and 1.43.7.2 While there is no evidence that the issue has been exploited in the wild, data gathered by the Shadowserver Foundation shows that 5,488 out of the total 6,936 Metabase instances are vulnerable as of July 26, 202

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed two high-severity security flaws in the Ubuntu kernel that could pave the way for local privilege escalation attacks. Cloud security firm Wiz, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News, said the easy-to-exploit shortcomings have the potential to impact 40% of Ubuntu users. "The impacted Ubuntu versions are prevalent in the cloud as they serve as the default operating systems for multiple [cloud service providers]," security researchers Sagi Tzadik and Shir Tamari said. The&nbsp; vulnerabilities &nbsp;– tracked as CVE-2023-32629 and 2023-2640 (CVSS scores: 7.8) and dubbed&nbsp; GameOver(lay) &nbsp;– are present in a module called&nbsp; OverlayFS &nbsp;and arise as a result of inadequate permissions checks in certain scenarios, enabling a local attacker to gain elevated privileges.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A severe privilege escalation issue impacting MikroTik RouterOS could be weaponized by remote malicious actors to execute arbitrary code and seize full control of vulnerable devices. Cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-30799 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.1), the shortcoming is expected to put approximately 500,000 and 900,000 RouterOS systems at risk of exploitation via their web and/or Winbox interfaces, respectively, VulnCheck disclosed in a Tuesday report. "CVE-2023-30799 does require authentication," security researcher Jacob Baines&nbsp; said . "In fact, the vulnerability itself is a simple privilege escalation from admin to 'super-admin' which results in access to an arbitrary function. Acquiring credentials to RouterOS systems is easier than one might expect." This is because the Mikrotik RouterOS operating system does not offer any protection against password brute-force attacks and ships with a well-known default "admin" user, with its password being an empty string

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A set of five security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the Terrestrial Trunked Radio ( TETRA ) standard for radio communication used widely by government entities and critical infrastructure sectors, including what's believed to be an intentional backdoor that could have potentially exposed sensitive information. The issues, discovered by Midnight Blue in 2021 and held back until now, have been collectively called&nbsp; TETRA:BURST . There is no conclusive evidence to determine that the vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild to date. "Depending on infrastructure and device configurations, these vulnerabilities allow for real time decryption, harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks, message injection, user deanonymization, or session key pinning," the Netherlands-based cybersecurity company&nbsp; said . Standardized by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in 1995, TETRA is used in more than 100 countries and as a police radio communication system

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new security vulnerability has been discovered in AMD's Zen 2 architecture-based processors that could be exploited to extract sensitive data such as encryption keys and passwords. Discovered by Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy, the flaw – codenamed&nbsp; Zenbleed &nbsp;and tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-20593 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.5) – allows data exfiltration at the rate of 30 kb per core, per second. The issue is part of a broader category of weaknesses called&nbsp; speculative execution attacks , in which the optimization technique widely used in modern CPUs is abused to access cryptographic keys from CPU registers. "Under specific microarchitectural circumstances, a register in 'Zen 2' CPUs may not be written to 0 correctly," AMD&nbsp; explained &nbsp;in an advisory. "This may cause data from another process and/or thread to be stored in the YMM register , which may allow an attacker to potentially access sensitive information."

"The ability to initiate an operation from a NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context can present potential security risks if not properly managed," security researcher Andrew Oliveau&nbsp; said . "For instance, misconfigured&nbsp; Custom Actions &nbsp;running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM can be exploited by attackers to execute local privilege escalation attacks." Successful exploitation of such weaknesses could pave the way for the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Both the flaws reside in the MSI installer's repair functionality, potentially crea

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a now-patched flaw in OpenSSH that could be potentially exploited to run arbitrary commands remotely on compromised hosts under specific conditions. "This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable OpenSSH's forwarded ssh-agent," Saeed Abbasi, manager of vulnerability research at Qualys,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis last week. The vulnerability is being tracked under the CVE identifier&nbsp; CVE-2023-38408 &nbsp;(CVSS score: N/A). It impacts all versions of OpenSSH before&nbsp; 9.3p2 . OpenSSH is a popular connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol that's used for encrypting all traffic to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. Successful exploitation requires the presence of certain libraries on the victim system and that the SSH authentication agent is&nbsp; forwarded &nbsp;to an attacker-controlled system. SSH agent is a&nbsp; background program &nbsp;that maintains users' keys

Two more security flaws have been disclosed in AMI MegaRAC Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) software that, if successfully exploited, could allow threat actors to remotely commandeer vulnerable servers and deploy malware. "These new vulnerabilities range in severity from High to Critical, including unauthenticated remote code execution and unauthorized device access with superuser permissions," Eclypsium researchers Vlad Babkin and Scott Scheferman said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "They can be exploited by remote attackers having access to Redfish remote management interfaces, or from a compromised host operating system." To make matters worse, the shortcomings could also be weaponized to drop persistent firmware implants that are immune to operating system reinstalls and hard drive replacements, brick motherboard components, cause physical damage through overvolting attacks, and induce indefinite reboot loops.

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a privilege escalation vulnerability in Google Cloud that could enable malicious actors tamper with application images and infect users, leading to supply chain attacks. The issue, dubbed&nbsp; Bad.Build , is rooted in the&nbsp; Google Cloud Build service , according to cloud security firm Orca, which discovered and reported the issue. "By abusing the flaw and enabling an impersonation of the default Cloud Build service, attackers can manipulate images in the Google Artifact Registry and inject malicious code," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement shared with The Hacker News. "Any applications built from the manipulated images are then affected and, if the malformed applications are meant to be deployed on customer's environments, the risk crosses from the supplying organization's environment to their customers' environments, constituting a major supply chain risk."

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in various services, including Honeywell Experion distributed control system (DCS) and QuickBlox, that, if successfully exploited, could result in severe compromise of affected systems. Dubbed Crit.IX, the nine flaws in the Honeywell Experion DCS platform allow for "unauthorized remote code execution, which means an attacker would have the power to take over the devices and alter the operation of the DCS controller, whilst also hiding the alterations from the engineering workstation that manages the controller," Armis said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. Put differently, the issues relate to lack of encryption and adequate authentication mechanisms in a proprietary protocol called Control Data Access (CDA) that's used to communicate between Experion Servers and C300 controllers, effectively enabling a threat actor to take over the devices and alter the operation of the DCS controller.

In a sign that cybersecurity researchers continue to be under the radar of malicious actors, a proof-of-concept (PoC) has been discovered on GitHub, concealing a backdoor with a "crafty" persistence method. "In this instance, the PoC is a wolf in sheep's clothing, harboring malicious intent under the guise of a harmless learning tool," Uptycs researchers Nischay Hegde and Siddartha Malladi&nbsp; said .

Hackers Exploit Windows Policy Loophole to Forge Kernel-Mode Driver Signatures<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/hackers-exploit-windows-policy-loophole.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Microsoft Windows policy loophole has been observed being exploited primarily by native Chinese-speaking threat actors to forge signatures on kernel-mode drivers. "Actors are leveraging multiple open-source tools that alter the signing date of kernel mode drivers to load malicious and unverified drivers signed with expired certificates," Cisco Talos said in an&nbsp; exhaustive two-part report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News. "This is a major threat, as access to the kernel provides complete access to a system, and therefore total compromise." Following responsible disclosure, Microsoft&nbsp; said &nbsp;it has taken steps to block all certificates to mitigate the threat. It further stated that its investigation found "the activity was limited to the abuse of several developer program accounts and that no Microsoft account compromise has been identified." The tech giant, besides suspending developer program accounts involved in the incident, emphasized that the threat a

Apple has released&nbsp; Rapid Security Response &nbsp;updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Safari web browser to&nbsp; address &nbsp;a zero-day flaw that it said has been actively exploited in the wild. The WebKit bug, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-37450 , could allow threat actors to achieve arbitrary code execution when processing specially crafted web content. The iPhone maker said it addressed the issue with improved checks. Credited with discovering and reporting the flaw is an anonymous researcher. As with most cases like this, there are scant details about the nature and the scale of the attacks and the identity of the threat actor behind them. But Apple noted in a terse advisory that it's "aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited." The updates, iOS 16.5.1 (a), iPadOS 16.5.1 (a), macOS Ventura 13.4.1 (a), and Safari 16.5.2, are available for devices running the following operating system versions: iOS 16.5.1 and iPadOS 16.5.1 macOS Ventura 13.4.1 macOS Big

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Progress Software has announced the discovery and patching of a critical SQL injection vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer, popular software used for secure file transfer. In addition, Progress Software has patched two other high-severity vulnerabilities. The identified SQL injection vulnerability, tagged as CVE-2023-36934 , could potentially allow unauthenticated attackers to gain unauthorized access to the MOVEit Transfer database. SQL injection vulnerabilities are a well-known and dangerous security flaw that allows attackers to manipulate databases and run any code they want. Attackers can send specifically designed payloads to certain endpoints of the affected application, which could change or expose sensitive data in the database. The reason CVE-2023-36934 is so critical is that it can be exploited without having to be logged in. This means that even attackers without valid credentials can potentially exploit the vulnerability. However, as of now, there have been no reports of

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mastodon, a popular decentralized social network, has released a security update to fix critical vulnerabilities that could expose millions of users to potential attacks. Mastodon is known for its federated model, consisting of thousands of separate servers called "instances," and it has over 14 million users across more than 20,000 instances. The most critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-36460 , allows hackers to exploit a flaw in the media attachments feature, creating and overwriting files in any location the software could access on an instance. This software vulnerability could be used for DoS and arbitrary remote code execution attacks, posing a significant threat to users and the broader Internet ecosystem. If an attacker gains control over multiple instances, they could cause harm by instructing users to download malicious applications or even bring down the entire Mastodon infrastructure. Fortunately, there is no evidence of this vulnerability being exploited so fa

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has released its monthly security updates for the Android operating system, addressing 46 new software vulnerabilities. Among these, three vulnerabilities have been identified as actively exploited in targeted attacks. One of the vulnerabilities tracked as CVE-2023-26083 is a memory leak flaw affecting the Arm Mali GPU driver for Bifrost, Avalon, and Valhall chips. This particular vulnerability was exploited in a previous attack that enabled spyware infiltration on Samsung devices in December 2022. This vulnerability was regarded as serious enough to prompt the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue a patching order for federal agencies in April 2023. Another significant vulnerability, identified as CVE-2021-29256, is a high-severity issue that affects specific versions of the Bifrost and Midgard Arm Mali GPU kernel drivers. This flaw permits an unprivileged user to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and escalate privileges to the root lev

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a newly identified security flaw in the Linux kernel that could allow a user to gain elevated privileges on a target host. Dubbed&nbsp; StackRot &nbsp;( CVE-2023-3269 , CVSS score: 7.8), the flaw impacts Linux versions 6.1 through 6.4. There is no evidence that the shortcoming has been exploited in the wild to date. "As StackRot is a Linux kernel vulnerability found in the memory management subsystem, it affects almost all kernel configurations and requires minimal capabilities to trigger," Peking University security researcher Ruihan Li&nbsp; said . "However, it should be noted that maple nodes are freed using RCU callbacks, delaying the actual memory deallocation until after the RCU grace period. Consequently, exploiting this vulnerability is considered challenging." Following&nbsp; responsible disclosure &nbsp;on June 15, 2023, it has been&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;in stable versions 6.1.37, 6.3.11, and 6.4.1 as of July 1, 2023, after a two-week effort led by Linus Tor

No less than 330,000 FortiGate firewalls are still unpatched and vulnerable to CVE-2023-27997, a critical security flaw affecting Fortinet devices that has come under active exploitation in the wild. Cybersecurity firm Bishop Fox, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;published last week, said that out of nearly 490,000 Fortinet SSL-VPN interfaces exposed on the internet, about 69 percent remain unpatched. CVE-2023-27997 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), also called XORtigate, is a critical vulnerability impacting Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy SSL-VPN appliances that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands via specifically crafted requests. Patches were released by Fortinet last month in versions 6.0.17, 6.2.15, 6.4.13, 7.0.12, and 7.2.5, although the company&nbsp; acknowledged &nbsp;that the flaw may have been "exploited in a limited number of cases" in attacks targeting government, manufacturing, and critical infrastructure sectors. Bishop Fox's analysis further found that 153,414

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as 200,000 WordPress websites are at risk of ongoing attacks exploiting a critical unpatched security vulnerability in the Ultimate Member plugin. The flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-3460 (CVSS score: 9.8), impacts all versions of the Ultimate Member plugin, including the latest version (2.6.6) that was released on June 29, 2023. Ultimate Member is a&nbsp; popular plugin &nbsp;that facilitates the creation of user-profiles and communities on WordPress sites. It also provides account management features. "This is a very serious issue: unauthenticated attackers may exploit this vulnerability to create new user accounts with administrative privileges, giving them the power to take complete control of affected sites," WordPress security firm WPScan&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert. Although details about the flaw have been withheld due to active abuse, it stems from an inadequate blocklist logic put in place to alter the wp_capabilities user meta value of a new user to that of an administrator a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical security flaw has been disclosed in miniOrange's&nbsp; Social Login and Register plugin &nbsp;for WordPress that could enable a malicious actor to log in as any user-provided information about email address is already known. Tracked as CVE-2023-2982 (CVSS score: 9.8), the authentication bypass flaw impacts all versions of the plugin, including and prior to 7.6.4. It was addressed on June 14, 2023, with the release of version 7.6.5 following responsible disclosure on June 2, 2023. "The vulnerability makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to any account on a site including accounts used to administer the site, if the attacker knows, or can find, the associated email address," Wordfence researcher István Márton&nbsp; said . The issue is rooted in the fact that the encryption key used to secure the information during login using social media accounts is hard-coded, thus leading to a scenario where attackers could create a valid request with a properl

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Drones that don't have any known security weaknesses could be the target of electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) attacks, potentially enabling a threat actor to achieve arbitrary code execution and compromise their functionality and safety. The research comes from IOActive, which&nbsp; found &nbsp;that it is "feasible to compromise the targeted device by injecting a specific EM glitch at the right time during a firmware update." "This would allow an attacker to gain code execution on the main processor, gaining access to the Android OS that implements the core functionality of the drone," Gabriel Gonzalez, director of hardware security at the company, said in a report published this month. The&nbsp; study , which was undertaken to determine the current security posture of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), was carried out on&nbsp; Mavic Pro , a popular quadcopter drone manufactured by DJI that employs various security features like signed and encrypted firmware, Trusted Executi

A critical security flaw has been disclosed in the WordPress "Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce" plugin that's&nbsp; installed &nbsp;on more than 30,000 websites. "This vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker to gain access to the accounts of users who have abandoned their carts, who are typically customers but can extend to other high-level users when the right conditions are met," Defiant's Wordfence&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. Tracked as CVE-2023-2986, the shortcoming has been rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS scoring system. It impacts all versions of the plugin, including and prior to versions 5.14.2. The problem, at its core, is a case of authentication bypass that arises as a result of insufficient encryption protections that are applied when customers are notified when they have abandoned their shopping carts on e-commerce sites without completing the purchase. Specifically, the encryption key is hard-coded in the plugin, thereby allowing

Critical 'nOAuth' Flaw in Microsoft Azure AD Enabled Complete Account Takeover<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/critical-noauth-flaw-in-microsoft-azure.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security shortcoming in Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) Open Authorization ( OAuth ) process could have been exploited to achieve full account takeover, researchers said. California-based identity and access management service Descope, which discovered and reported the issue in April 2023, dubbed it&nbsp; nOAuth . "nOAuth is an authentication implementation flaw that can affect Microsoft Azure AD multi-tenant OAuth applications," Omer Cohen, chief security officer at Descope,&nbsp; said . The misconfiguration has to do with how a malicious actor can modify email attributes under "Contact Information" in the Azure AD account and exploit the "Log in with Microsoft" feature to hijack a victim account. To pull off the attack, all an adversary has to do is to create and access an Azure AD admin account and modify their email address to that of a victim and take advantage of the single sign-on scheme on a vulnerable app or website.

Three security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in operational technology (OT) products from Wago and Schneider Electric. The flaws, per Forescout, are part of a&nbsp; broader &nbsp; set &nbsp;of&nbsp; shortcomings &nbsp;collectively called&nbsp; OT:ICEFALL , which now comprises a total of 61 issues spanning 13 different vendors. "OT:ICEFALL demonstrates the need for tighter scrutiny of, and improvements to, processes related to secure design, patching and testing in OT device vendors," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The most severe of the flaws is&nbsp; CVE-2022-46680 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), which concerns the plaintext transmission of credentials in the ION/TCP protocol used by power meters from Schneider Electric.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two "dangerous" security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Microsoft Azure Bastion and Azure Container Registry that could have been exploited to carry out cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. "The vulnerabilities allowed unauthorized access to the victim's session within the compromised Azure service iframe, which can lead to severe consequences, including unauthorized data access, unauthorized modifications, and disruption of the Azure services iframes," Orca security researcher Lidor Ben Shitrit&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. XSS attacks &nbsp;take place when threat actors inject arbitrary code into an otherwise trusted website, which then gets executed every time when unsuspecting users visit the site. The two flaws identified by Orca leverage a weakness in the postMessage iframe, which enables cross-origin communication between Window objects. This meant that the shortcoming could be abused to embed endpoints within remote servers usin

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security flaw has been uncovered in the WooCommerce Stripe Gateway WordPress plugin that could lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-34000 , impacts versions 7.4.0 and below. It was addressed by the plugin maintainers in version 7.4.1, which shipped on May 30, 2023. WooCommerce Stripe Gateway&nbsp; allows &nbsp;e-commerce websites to directly accept various payment methods through Stripe's payment processing API. It boasts of over 900,000 active installations. According to Patch security researcher Rafie Muhammad, the plugin suffers from what's called an unauthenticated Insecure direct object references ( IDOR ) vulnerability, which allows a bad actor to bypass authorization and access resources. Specially, the problem stems from the insecure handling of order objects and a lack of adequate access control mechanism in the plugin's 'javascript_params' and 'payment_fields' functions of the plugin.

Security researchers have warned about an "easily exploitable" flaw in the Microsoft Visual Studio installer that could be abused by a malicious actor to impersonate a legitimate publisher and distribute malicious extensions. "A threat actor could impersonate a popular publisher and issue a malicious extension to compromise a targeted system," Varonis researcher Dolev Taler&nbsp; said . "Malicious extensions have been used to steal sensitive information, silently access and change code, or take full control of a system." The vulnerability, which is tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-28299 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 5.5), was addressed by Microsoft as part of its&nbsp; Patch Tuesday updates &nbsp;for April 2023, describing it as a spoofing flaw. The bug discovered by Varonis has to do with the Visual Studio user interface, which allows for spoofed publisher digital signatures. Specifically, it trivially bypasses a restriction that prevents users from entering information in the "product

Details have emerged about a now-patched actively exploited security flaw in Microsoft Windows that could be abused by a threat actor to gain elevated privileges on affected systems. The vulnerability, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-29336 , is rated 7.8 for severity and concerns an elevation of privilege bug in the Win32k component. "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain SYSTEM privileges," Microsoft&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in an advisory issued last month as part of Patch Tuesday updates. Avast researchers Jan Vojtěšek, Milánek, and Luigino Camastra were credited with discovering and reporting the flaw. Win32k.sys is a kernel-mode driver and an integral part of the Windows architecture, being responsible for graphical device interface (GUI) and window management.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical flaw in Progress Software's in MOVEit Transfer managed file transfer application has come under widespread exploitation in the wild to take over vulnerable systems. The shortcoming, which is yet to be assigned a CVE identifier, relates to a severe SQL injection vulnerability that could lead to escalated privileges and potential unauthorized access to the environment. "An SQL injection vulnerability has been found in the MOVEit Transfer web application that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to MOVEit Transfer's database," the company&nbsp; said . "Depending on the database engine being used (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Azure SQL), an attacker may be able to infer information about the structure and contents of the database in addition to executing SQL statements that alter or delete database elements." Patches for the bug have been made available by the Massachusetts-based company, which also owns Telerik, in t

Urgent WordPress Update Fixes Critical Flaw in Jetpack Plugin on Million of Sites<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/urgent-wordpress-update-fixes-critical.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WordPress has issued an automatic update to address a critical flaw in the&nbsp; Jetpack plugin &nbsp;that's installed on over five million sites. The vulnerability, which was unearthed during an internal security audit, resides in an API present in the plugin since&nbsp; version 2.0 , which was released in November 2012. "This vulnerability could be used by authors on a site to manipulate any files in the WordPress installation," Jetpack&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. 102 new versions of Jetpack have been released to remediate the bug. While there is no evidence the issue has been exploited in the wild, it's not uncommon for flaws in popular WordPress plugins to be leveraged by threat actors looking to take over the sites for malicious ends. This is not the first time severe security weaknesses in Jetpack have prompted WordPress to force install the patches. In November 2019, Jetpack released&nbsp; version 7.9.1 &nbsp;to fix a defect in the way the plugin handled embed code that had existed since July 2017 (ve

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have found "backdoor-like behavior" within Gigabyte systems, which they say enables the&nbsp; UEFI firmware &nbsp;of the devices to drop a Windows executable and retrieve updates in an unsecure format. Firmware security firm Eclypsium&nbsp; said &nbsp;it first detected the anomaly in April 2023. Gigabyte has since acknowledged and addressed the issue. "Most Gigabyte firmware includes a Windows Native Binary executable embedded inside of the UEFI firmware," John Loucaides, senior vice president of strategy at Eclypsium, told The Hacker News. "The detected Windows executable is dropped to disk and executed as part of the Windows startup process, similar to the&nbsp; LoJack double agent attack . This executable then downloads and runs additional binaries via insecure methods." "Only the intention of the author can distinguish this sort of vulnerability from a malicious backdoor," Loucaides added. The executable, per Eclypsium, is embedded in

Improperly deactivated and abandoned Salesforce&nbsp; Sites &nbsp;and&nbsp; Communities &nbsp;(aka Experience Cloud) could pose severe risks to organizations, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data. Data security firm Varonis dubbed the abandoned, unprotected, and unmonitored resources " ghost sites ." "When these Communities are no longer needed, though, they are often set aside but not deactivated," Varonis Threat Labs researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report shared with The Hacker News. "Because these unused sites are not maintained, they aren't tested against vulnerabilities, and Admins fail to update the site's security measures according to newer guidelines." Varonis said it found many of these deactivated (but still active) sites still fetching new data, thereby allowing threat actors to extract data by manipulating the&nbsp; host header &nbsp;in the HTTP request. Identifying the complete internal URLs associated with the sites is challenging but not impossible, as an adversary could leverage too

Microsoft Details Critical Apple macOS Vulnerability Allowing SIP Protection Bypass<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/microsoft-details-critical-apple-macos.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has shared details of a now-patched flaw in Apple macOS that could be abused by threat actors with root access to bypass security enforcements and perform arbitrary actions on affected devices. Specifically, the flaw – dubbed&nbsp; Migraine &nbsp;and tracked as CVE-2023-32369 – could be abused to get around a key security measure called System Integrity Protection ( SIP ), or "rootless," which limits the actions the root user can perform on protected files and folders. "The most straight-forward implication of a SIP bypass is that [...] an attacker can create files that are protected by SIP and therefore undeletable by ordinary means," Microsoft researchers Jonathan Bar Or, Michael Pearse, and Anurag Bohra&nbsp; said . Even worse, it could be exploited to gain arbitrary kernel code execution and even access sensitive data by replacing databases that manage Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) policies. The bypass is made possible by leveraging a built-in macOS tool called&nbsp; Migrat

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have discovered an inexpensive attack technique that could be leveraged to brute-force fingerprints on smartphones to bypass user authentication and seize control of the devices. The approach, dubbed&nbsp; BrutePrint , bypasses limits put in place to counter failed biometric authentication attempts by weaponizing two zero-day vulnerabilities in the smartphone fingerprint authentication (SFA) framework. The flaws, Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), leverage logical defects in the authentication framework, which arises due to insufficient protection of fingerprint data on the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) of fingerprint sensors. The result is a "hardware approach to do man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks for fingerprint image hijacking," researchers Yu Chen and Yiling He&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a research paper. "BrutePrint acts as a middleman between fingerprint sensor and&nbsp; TEE &nbsp;[Trusted Execution Environment]." The goal, at its core, is to be

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical security vulnerability has been disclosed in the Open Authorization (OAuth) implementation of the application development framework Expo.io. The shortcoming, assigned the CVE identifier&nbsp; CVE-2023-28131 , has a severity rating of 9.6 on the CVSS scoring system. API security firm Salt Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;the issue rendered services using the framework susceptible to credential leakage, which could then be used to hijack accounts and siphon sensitive data. Under certain circumstances, a threat actor could have taken advantage of the flaw to perform arbitrary actions on behalf of a compromised user on various platforms such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter. Expo, similar to Electron, is an open source platform for developing universal native apps that run on Android, iOS, and the web. It's worth noting that for the attack to be successful, sites and applications using Expo should have configured the AuthSession Proxy setting for single sign-on (SSO) using a third-party provider

Severe Flaw in Google Cloud's Cloud SQL Service Exposed Confidential Data<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/severe-flaw-in-google-clouds-cloud-sql.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new security flaw has been disclosed in the Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Cloud SQL service that could be potentially exploited to obtain access to confidential data. "The vulnerability could have enabled a malicious actor to escalate from a basic Cloud SQL user to a full-fledged sysadmin on a container, gaining access to internal GCP data like secrets, sensitive files, passwords, in addition to customer data," Israeli cloud security firm Dig&nbsp; said . Cloud SQL &nbsp;is a fully-managed solution to build MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server databases for cloud-based applications. The multi-stage attack chain identified by Dig, in a nutshell, leveraged a gap in the cloud platform's security layer associated with SQL Server to escalate the privileges of a user to that of an administrator role. The elevated permissions subsequently made it possible to abuse another critical misconfiguration to obtain system administrator rights and take full control of the database server.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned of active exploitation of a medium-severity flaw affecting Samsung devices. The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-21492 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 4.4), impacts select Samsung devices running Android versions 11, 12, and 13. The South Korean electronics giant described the issue as an information disclosure flaw that could be exploited by a privileged attacker to bypass address space layout randomization ( ASLR ) protections. ASLR is a&nbsp; security technique &nbsp;that's designed to thwart memory corruption and code execution flaws by obscuring the location of an executable in a device's memory. Samsung, in an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;released this month, said it was "notified that an exploit for this issue had existed in the wild," adding it was privately disclosed to the company on January 17, 2023.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Active Directory (AD) is among the oldest pieces of software still used in the production environment and can be found in most organizations today. This is despite the fact that its historical security gaps have never been amended. For example, because of its inability to apply any security measures beyond checking for a password and username match, AD (as well the resources it manages) is dangerously exposed to the use of compromised credentials. Furthermore, this exposure is not confined to the on-prem environment. The common practice of syncing passwords between AD and the cloud identity provider means any AD breach is a potential risk to the SaaS environment as well. In this article, we'll explore AD's inherent security weaknesses and examine their scope and potential impact. We'll then learn how Silverfort's Unified Identity Protection platform can address these weaknesses at their root and provide organizations using AD with the resiliency they need to thwart identity threa

It was addressed with improved bounds checks. CVE-2023-28204 &nbsp;- An out-of-bounds read issue in WebKit that could be abused to disclose sensitive information when processing web content. It was addressed with improved input validation. CVE-2023-32373 &nbsp;- A use-after free bug in WebKit that could lead to arbitrary code execution when processing maliciously crafted web content. It was addressed with improved memory management. The iPhone maker credited Clément Lecigne of Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Donncha Ó Cearbhaill of Amnesty International's Security Lab for reporting C

Cisco has released updates to address a set of nine security flaws in its Small Business Series Switches that could be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to run arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. "These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of requests that are sent to the web interface," Cisco&nbsp; said , crediting an unnamed external researcher for reporting the issues. Four of the nine vulnerabilities are rated 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS scoring system, making them critical in nature. The nine flaws affect the following product lines - 250 Series Smart Switches (Fixed in firmware version 2.5.9.16) 350 Series Managed Switches (Fixed in firmware version 2.5.9.16) 350X Series Stackable Managed Switches (Fixed in firmware version 2.5.9.16) 550X Series Stackable Managed Switches (Fixed in firmware version 2.5.9.16) Business 250 Series Smart Switches (Fixed in firmware version 3.3.0.16) Business 350 Series Managed Switches (F

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The second generation version of Belkin's Wemo Mini Smart Plug has been found to contain a buffer overflow vulnerability that could be weaponized by a threat actor to inject arbitrary commands remotely. The issue, assigned the identifier&nbsp; CVE-2023-27217 , was discovered and reported to Belkin on January 9, 2023, by Israeli IoT security company Sternum , which reverse-engineered the device and gained firmware access. Wemo Mini Smart Plug V2 ( F7C063 ) offers convenient remote control, allowing users to turn electronic devices on or off using a companion app installed on a smartphone or tablet. The heart of the problem lies in a feature that makes it possible to rename the smart plug to a more " FriendlyName ." The default name assigned is " Wemo mini 6E9 ." "The name length is limited to 30 characters or less, but this rule is only enforced by the app itself," security researchers Amit Serper and Reuven Yakar&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hac

Industrial Cellular Routers at Risk: 11 New Vulnerabilities Expose OT Networks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/industrial-cellular-routers-at-risk-11.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Several security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in cloud management platforms associated with three industrial cellular router vendors that could expose operational technology (OT) networks to external attacks. The findings were&nbsp; presented &nbsp;by Israeli industrial cybersecurity firm OTORIO at the Black Hat Asia 2023 conference last week. The 11 vulnerabilities allow "remote code execution and full control over hundreds of thousands of devices and OT networks - in some cases, even those not actively configured to use the cloud." Specifically, the shortcomings reside in the cloud-based management solutions offered by Sierra Wireless, Teltonika Networks, and InHand Networks to remotely manage and operate devices. Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities could pose severe risks to industrial environments, allowing adversaries to sidestep security layers as well as exfiltrate sensitive information and achieve code execution remotely on the internal networks.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as five security flaws have been disclosed in Netgear RAX30 routers that could be chained to bypass authentication and achieve remote code execution. "Successful exploits could allow attackers to monitor users' internet activity, hijack internet connections, and redirect traffic to malicious websites or inject malware into network traffic," Claroty security researcher Uri Katz&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. Additionally, a network-adjacent threat actor could also weaponize the flaws to access and control networked smart devices like security cameras, thermostats, smart locks; tamper with router settings, and even use a compromised network to launch attacks against other devices or networks. The list of flaws, which were&nbsp; demonstrated &nbsp;at the Pwn2Own hacking competition held at Toronto in December 2022, is as follows - CVE-2023-27357 (CVSS score: 6.5) - Missing Authentication Information Disclosure Vulnerability CVE-2023-27368 (CVSS score: 8.8) - Stack-based Buffer

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security vulnerability has been disclosed in the popular WordPress plugin&nbsp; Essential Addons for Elementor &nbsp;that could be potentially exploited to achieve elevated privileges on affected sites. The issue, tracked as CVE-2023-32243, has been addressed by the plugin maintainers in version 5.7.2 that was shipped on May 11, 2023. Essential Addons for Elementor has over one million active installations. "This plugin suffers from an unauthenticated privilege escalation vulnerability and allows any unauthenticated user to escalate their privilege to that of any user on the WordPress site," Patchstack researcher Rafie Muhammad&nbsp; said . Successful exploitation of the flaw could permit a threat actor to reset the password of any arbitrary user as long as the malicious party is aware of their username. The shortcoming is believed to have existed since version 5.4.0. This can have serious ramifications as the flaw could be weaponized to reset the password associated with an administ

Cybersecurity researchers have shared details about a now-patched security flaw in Windows MSHTML platform that could be abused to bypass integrity protections on targeted machines.

Akamai security researcher Ben Barnea, who discovered and reported the bug, noted that all Windows versions are affected, but pointed out Microsoft, Exchange&nbsp; servers with the March update omit the vulnerable feature. "An unauthenticated attacker on the internet could use the vulnerability to coerce an Outlook client to connect to an attacker-controlled server," Barnea&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This results in NTLM credentials theft. It is a zero-click vulnerability, meaning it can be triggered with no user interaction." It's also worth noting that CVE-2023-

Microsoft has rolled out&nbsp; Patch Tuesday updates &nbsp;for May 2023 to address 38 security flaws, including one zero-day bug that it said is being actively exploited in the wild. Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)&nbsp; said &nbsp;the volume is the lowest since August 2021, although it pointed out that "this number is expected to rise in the coming months." Of the 38 vulnerabilities, six are rated Critical and 32 are rated Important in severity. Eight of the flaws have been tagged with "Exploitation More Likely" assessment by Microsoft. This is aside from&nbsp; 18 flaws &nbsp;– including 11 bugs since the start of May – the Windows maker resolved in its Chromium-based Edge browser following the release of April Patch Tuesday updates. Topping the list is&nbsp; CVE-2023-29336 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), a privilege escalation flaw in Win32k that has come under active exploitation.

Users of Advanced Custom Fields plugin for WordPress are being urged to update version 6.1.6 following the discovery of a security flaw. The issue, assigned the identifier CVE-2023-30777, relates to a case of reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) that could be abused to inject arbitrary executable scripts into otherwise benign websites. The plugin, which is available both as a free and pro version, has over&nbsp; two million active installations . The issue was discovered and reported to the maintainers on May 2, 2023. "This vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user from stealing sensitive information to, in this case, privilege escalation on the WordPress site by tricking a privileged user to visit the crafted URL path," Patchstack researcher Rafie Muhammad&nbsp; said . Reflected XSS &nbsp;attacks usually occur when victims are tricked into clicking on a bogus link sent via email or another route, causing the malicious code to be sent to the vulnerable website, which reflects the

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have found a way to exploit a recently disclosed critical flaw in PaperCut servers in a manner that bypasses all current detections. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-27350 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the issue affects PaperCut MF and NG installations that could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. While the flaw was&nbsp; patched &nbsp;by the Australian company on March 8, 2023, the first signs of active exploitation emerged on April 13, 2023. Since then, the vulnerability has been&nbsp; weaponized &nbsp;by multiple threat groups, including&nbsp; ransomware actors , with post-exploitation activity resulting in the execution of PowerShell commands designed to drop additional payloads. Now, VulnCheck has&nbsp; published &nbsp;a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit that sidesteps existing detection signatures by leveraging the fact that "PaperCut NG and MF offer multiple paths to code execution." It's worth noting that public exploits for the fla

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered weaknesses in a software implementation of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that could be weaponized to achieve a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on vulnerable BGP peers. The three vulnerabilities reside in version 8.4 of&nbsp; FRRouting , a popular open source internet routing protocol suite for Linux and Unix platforms. It's currently used by several vendors like&nbsp; NVIDIA Cumulus ,&nbsp; DENT , and&nbsp; SONiC , posing supply chain risks. The discovery is the result of an analysis of seven different implementations of BGP carried out by Forescout Vedere Labs: FRRouting, BIRD, OpenBGPd, Mikrotik RouterOS, Juniper JunOS, Cisco IOS, and Arista EOS. BGP is a&nbsp; gateway protocol &nbsp;that's designed to exchange routing and reachability information between autonomous systems.

Microsoft has confirmed that the&nbsp; active exploitation of PaperCut servers &nbsp;is linked to attacks that are designed to deliver Cl0p and LockBit ransomware families.

Apache Superset Vulnerability: Insecure Default Configuration Exposes Servers to RCE Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/apache-superset-vulnerability-insecure.html"> Full Text</a>
<p></p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The maintainers of the&nbsp; Apache Superset &nbsp;open source data visualization software have released fixes to plug an insecure default configuration that could lead to remote code execution. The vulnerability, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-27524 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.9), impacts versions up to and including 2.0.1 and relates to the use of a default SECRET_KEY that could be abused by attackers to authenticate and access unauthorized resources on internet-exposed installations. Naveen Sunkavally, the chief architect at Horizon3.ai, described the issue as "a dangerous default configuration in Apache Superset that allows an unauth attacker to gain remote code execution, harvest credentials, and compromise data." It's worth noting that the flaw does not affect Superset instances that have changed the default value for the SECRET_KEY config to a more cryptographically secure random string. The cybersecurity firm, which found that the SECRET_KEY is defaulted to the value "\x02\x01thisismy

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware has released updates to resolve multiple security flaws impacting its Workstation and Fusion software, the most critical of which could allow a local attacker to achieve code execution. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-20869 (CVSS score: 9.3), is described as a stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability that resides in the functionality for sharing host Bluetooth devices with the virtual machine. "A malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may exploit this issue to execute code as the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host," the company&nbsp; said . Also patched by VMware is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability affecting the same feature (CVE-2023-20870, CVSS score: 7.1), that could be abused by a local adversary with admin privileges to read sensitive information contained in hypervisor memory from a virtual machine. Both vulnerabilities were&nbsp; demonstrated &nbsp;by researchers from STAR Labs on the third day of the Pwn2O

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a now-patched zero-day flaw in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that could have enabled threat actors to conceal an unremovable, malicious application inside a victim's Google account. Dubbed GhostToken by Israeli cybersecurity startup Astrix Security, the shortcoming impacts all Google accounts, including enterprise-focused Workspace accounts. It was discovered and reported to Google on June 19, 2022. The company deployed a global-patch more than nine months later on April 7, 2023. "The vulnerability [...] allows attackers to gain permanent and unremovable access to a victim's Google account by converting an already authorized third-party application into a malicious trojan app, leaving the victim's personal data exposed forever," Astrix&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. In a nutshell, the flaw makes it possible for an attacker to hide their malicious app from a victim's Google account&nbsp; application management page , the

Cisco and VMware have released security updates to address critical security flaws in their products that could be exploited by malicious actors to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. The most severe of the vulnerabilities is a command injection flaw&nbsp; in Cisco Industrial Network Director &nbsp;(CVE-2023-20036, CVSS score: 9.9), which resides in the web UI component and arises as a result of improper input validation when&nbsp; uploading a Device Pack . "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM on the underlying operating system of an affected device," Cisco&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory released on April 19, 2023. The networking equipment major also resolved a medium-severity file permissions vulnerability in the same product (CVE-2023-20039, CVSS score: 5.5) that an authenticated, local attacker could abuse to view sensitive information.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A fresh round of patches has been made available for the vm2 JavaScript library to address two critical flaws that could be exploited to break out of the sandbox protections. Both the flaws –&nbsp; CVE-2023-29199 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-30547 &nbsp;– are rated 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS scoring system and have been addressed in versions 3.9.16 and 3.9.17, respectively. Successful&nbsp; exploitation &nbsp;of the&nbsp; bugs , which allow an attacker to raise an unsanitized host exception, could be weaponized to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code in the host context. "A threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox," the maintainers of the vm2 library said in an alert. Credited with discovering and reporting the vulnerabilities is security researcher&nbsp; SeungHyun Lee , who has also&nbsp; released &nbsp; proof-of-concept &nbsp;(PoC) exploits for the two issues in question.

Newly Discovered "By-Design" Flaw in Microsoft Azure Could Expose Storage Accounts to Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/newly-discovered-by-design-flaw-in.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A "by-design flaw" uncovered in Microsoft Azure could be exploited by attackers to gain access to storage accounts, move laterally in the environment, and even execute remote code. "It is possible to abuse and leverage Microsoft Storage Accounts by manipulating Azure Functions to steal access-tokens of higher privilege identities, move laterally, potentially access critical business assets, and execute remote code (RCE)," Orca said in a new&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News. The exploitation path that underpins this attack is a mechanism called&nbsp; Shared Key authorization , which is enabled by default on storage accounts. According to Microsoft, Azure generates two 512-bit storage account access keys when creating a storage account. These keys can be used to authorize access to data via Shared Key authorization, or via SAS tokens that are signed with the shared key. "Storage account access keys provide full access to the configuration of a storage accoun

The maintainers of the vm2 JavaScript sandbox module have shipped a patch to address a critical flaw that could be abused to break out of security boundaries and execute arbitrary shellcode. The flaw, which affects all versions, including and prior to 3.9.14, was&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by researchers from South Korea-based&nbsp; KAIST WSP Lab &nbsp;on April 6, 2023, prompting vm2 to release a fix with&nbsp; version 3.9.15 &nbsp;on Friday. "A threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox," vm2&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in an advisory. The vulnerability has been assigned the identified&nbsp; CVE-2023-29017 &nbsp;and is rated 9.8 on the CVSS scoring system. The issue stems from the fact that it does not properly handle errors that occur in asynchronous functions. vm2 is a&nbsp; popular library &nbsp;that's used to run untrusted code in an isolated environment on Node.js. It has nearly four million weekly downloads and is used in 721 packages . KAIST security res

Microsoft has patched a misconfiguration issue impacting the Azure Active Directory ( AAD ) identity and access management service that exposed several "high-impact" applications to unauthorized access.

"Those attacks could compromise users' personal data, including Outlook emails and SharePoint documents." The issues were reported to Microsoft in January and February 2022, following which the tech giant applied fixes and awarded Wiz a $40,000 bug bounty. Redmond&nbsp; said &nbsp;it found no evidence that the misconfigurations were exploited in the wild.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a now-patched vulnerability in Azure Service Fabric Explorer ( SFX ) that could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-23383 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.2), the issue has been dubbed "Super FabriXss" by Orca Security, a nod to the&nbsp; FabriXss flaw &nbsp;(CVE-2022-35829, CVSS score: 6.2) that was fixed by Microsoft in October 2022. "The Super FabriXss vulnerability enables remote attackers to leverage an XSS vulnerability to achieve remote code execution on a container hosted on a Service Fabric node without the need for authentication," security researcher Lidor Ben Shitrit&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. XSS refers to a kind of&nbsp; client-side code injection &nbsp;attack that makes it possible to upload malicious scripts into otherwise trusted websites. The scripts then get executed every time a victim visits the compromised website, thereby leading to unintended consequences. While both FabriXss and Super FabriXss

Successful exploitation of the shortcoming could be abused to hijack TCP connections or intercept client and web traffic, researchers Domien Schepers, Aanjhan Ranganathan, and Mathy Vanhoef said in a paper published this week. The&nbsp; approach &nbsp;exploits&nbsp; power-save mechanisms &nbsp;in endpoint devices to trick access points into leaking&nbsp; data frames &nbsp;in plaintext, or encrypt them using&nbsp; an all-zero key . "The unprotected nature of the power-save bit in a frame's header [...] also allows an adversary to force queue frames intended for a specific client resulting in its disconnection and trivially executing a denial-of-service attack," the researchers noted. In other words, the goal is to leak frames from the access point destined to a victim client station

Microsoft Warns of Stealthy Outlook Vulnerability Exploited by Russian Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/microsoft-warns-of-stealthy-outlook.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Friday shared guidance to help customers discover indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with a recently patched Outlook vulnerability. Tracked as CVE-2023-23397 (CVSS score: 9.8), the&nbsp; critical flaw &nbsp;relates to a case of privilege escalation that could be exploited to steal NT Lan Manager (NTLM) hashes and stage a&nbsp; relay attack &nbsp;without requiring any user interaction. "External attackers could send specially crafted emails that will cause a connection from the victim to an untrusted location of attackers' control," the company&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in an advisory released this month. "This will leak the&nbsp; Net-NTLMv2 hash &nbsp;of the victim to the untrusted network which an attacker can then relay to another service and authenticate as the victim." The vulnerability was resolved by Microsoft as part of its&nbsp; Patch Tuesday updates &nbsp;for March 2023, but not before Russia-based threat actors weaponized the flaw in attacks targeting government, transportation, ene

Patches have been released for a critical security flaw impacting the WooCommerce Payments plugin for WordPress, which is installed on over 500,000 websites.

A new Golang-based botnet dubbed&nbsp; HinataBot &nbsp;has been observed to leverage known flaws to compromise routers and servers and use them to stage distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

Among the methods used to distribute the malware are the exploitation of exposed Hadoop YARN servers and security flaws in Realtek SDK devices ( CVE-2014-8361 )and Huawei HG532 routers ( CVE-2017-17215 , CVSS score: 8.8). Unpatched vulnerabilities and weak credentials have been a low-hanging fruit for attackers, representing an easy, well-documented entry point that does not require sophisticated social engineering tactics or other methods.

Fortinet FortiOS Flaw Exploited in Targeted Cyberattacks on Government Entities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/fortinet-fortios-flaw-exploited-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government entities and large organizations have been targeted by an unknown threat actor by exploiting a security flaw in Fortinet FortiOS software to result in data loss and OS and file corruption. "The complexity of the exploit suggests an advanced actor and that it is highly targeted at governmental or government-related targets," Fortinet researchers Guillaume Lovet and Alex Kong said in an advisory last week. The zero-day flaw in question is CVE-2022-41328 (CVSS score: 6.5), a medium security path traversal bug in FortiOS that could lead to arbitrary code execution. "An improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory vulnerability ('path traversal') [CWE-22] in FortiOS may allow a privileged attacker to read and write arbitrary files via crafted CLI commands," the company noted. The shortcoming impacts FortiOS versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.4.0 through 6.4.11, 7.0.0 through 7.0.9, and 7.2.0 through 7.2.3. Fixes are available in versions 6.4.1

More than a dozen security flaws have been disclosed in E11, a smart intercom product made by Chinese company Akuvox . "The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to execute code remotely in order to activate and control the device's camera and microphone, steal video and images, or gain a network foothold," Claroty security researcher Vera Mens&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up. Akuvox E11 is described by the company on its website as a " SIP &nbsp;[Session Initiation Protocol] video doorphone specially designed for villas, houses, and apartments." The&nbsp; product listing , however, has been taken down from the website, displaying an error message: "Page does not exist." A&nbsp; snapshot &nbsp;captured by Google shows that the page was live as recently as March 12, 2023, 05:59:51 GMT. The attacks can manifest either through remote code execution within the local area network (LAN) or remote activation of the E11's camera and microphone, allowing the adversary to c

Fortinet has released fixes to&nbsp; address 15 security flaws , including one critical vulnerability impacting FortiOS and FortiProxy that could enable a threat actor to take control of affected systems. The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-25610 , is rated 9.3 out of 10 for severity and was internally discovered and reported by its security teams. "A buffer underwrite ('buffer underflow') vulnerability in FortiOS and FortiProxy administrative interface may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device and/or perform a DoS on the GUI, via specifically crafted requests," Fortinet&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. Underflow bugs , also called&nbsp; buffer underruns , occur when the input data is shorter than the reserved space, causing unpredictable behavior or leakage of sensitive data from memory. Other possible consequences include memory corruption that could either be weaponized to induce a crash or execute arbitrary code. Fortinet said it's not

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A pair of severe security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the Jenkins open source automation server that could lead to code execution on targeted systems. The flaws, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-27898 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-27905 , impact the Jenkins server and Update Center, and have been collectively christened&nbsp; CorePlague &nbsp;by cloud security firm Aqua. All versions of Jenkins versions prior to 2.319.2 are vulnerable and exploitable. "Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's Jenkins server, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the Jenkins server," the company said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The shortcomings are the result of how Jenkins processes plugins available from the&nbsp; Update Center , thereby potentially enabling a threat actor to upload a plugin with a malicious payload and trigger a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

As a primary working interface, the browser plays a significant role in today's corporate environment. The browser is constantly used by employees to access websites, SaaS applications and internal applications, from both managed and unmanaged devices. A new report published by LayerX, a browser security vendor, finds that attackers are exploiting this reality and are targeting it in increasing numbers ( download report here ). The key report findings&nbsp; Over half of all the browsers in the enterprise environment are misconfigured.&nbsp; While a configured browser is nearly impossible to compromise, stealing data from misconfigured browsers is like taking candy from a baby. The Leading misconfigurations are improper use of personal browser profiles on work devices (29%), poor patching routine (50%), and the use of corporate browser profiles on unmanaged devices. 3 of every 10 SaaS applications are non-corporate shadow SaaS,&nbsp; and no SaaS discovery/security solution can address its ris

As many as&nbsp; 24 different products , including Access Manager Plus, ADManager Plus, ADSelfService Plus, Password Manager Pro, Remote Access Plus, and Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM), are affected by the issue. The shortcoming "allows unauthenticated remote code execution due to usage of an outdated third-party dependency for XML signature validation, Apache Santuario," Bitdefender's Martin Zugec&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical advisory shared with The Hacker News. According to the Romanian cybersecurity firm, the exploitation efforts are said to have commenced the day after penetration testing firm Horizon3.ai released a proo

Apple has revised the&nbsp; security advisories &nbsp;it released last month to include three new vulnerabilities impacting&nbsp; iOS, iPadOS , and&nbsp; macOS . The first flaw is a&nbsp; race condition &nbsp;in the Crash Reporter component (CVE-2023-23520) that could enable a malicious actor to read arbitrary files as root. The iPhone maker said it addressed the issue with additional validation. The two other vulnerabilities, credited to Trellix researcher Austin Emmitt, reside in the&nbsp; Foundation framework &nbsp;(CVE-2023-23530 and CVE-2023-23531) and could be weaponized to achieve code execution. "An app may be able to execute arbitrary code out of its sandbox or with certain elevated privileges," Apple said, adding it patched the issues with "improved memory handling." The medium to high-severity vulnerabilities have been patched in iOS 16.3, iPadOS 16.3, and macOS Ventura 13.2 that were shipped on January 23, 2023. Trellix, in its own report on Tuesday,&nbsp; classified &nbsp;the two flaws as a &amp;qu

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware on Tuesday released patches to address a critical security vulnerability affecting its Carbon Black App Control product. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-20858 , the shortcoming carries a CVSS score of 9.1 out of a maximum of 10 and impacts App Control versions 8.7.x, 8.8.x, and 8.9.x. The virtualization services provider describes the issue as an injection vulnerability. Security researcher Jari Jääskelä has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug. "A malicious actor with privileged access to the App Control administration console may be able to use specially crafted input allowing access to the underlying server operating system," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. VMware said there are no workarounds that resolve the flaw, necessitating that customers update to versions 8.7.8, 8.8.6, and 8.9.4 to mitigate potential risks. It's worth pointing out that Jääskelä was also credited with reporting two critical vulnerabilities in the same product ( CVE-2022-229

Cisco has rolled out security updates to address a critical flaw reported in the ClamAV open source antivirus engine that could lead to remote code execution on susceptible devices. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-20032 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the issue relates to a case of remote code execution residing in the HFS+ file parser component. The flaw affects versions 1.0.0 and earlier, 0.105.1 and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier. Google security engineer Simon Scannell has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug. "This vulnerability is due to a missing buffer size check that may result in a heap buffer overflow write," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HFS+ partition file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A popular npm package with more than 3.5 million weekly downloads has been found vulnerable to an account takeover attack. "The package can be taken over by recovering an expired domain name for one of its maintainers and resetting the password," software supply chain security company Illustria&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. While npm's security protections limit users to have only one active email address per account, the Israeli firm said it was able to reset the GitHub password using the recovered domain. The attack, in a nutshell, grants a threat actor access to the package's associated GitHub account, effectively making it possible to publish trojanized versions to the npm registry that can be weaponized to conduct supply chain attacks at scale. This is achieved by taking advantage of a GitHub Action that's configured in the repository to automatically publish the packages when new code changes are pushed.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have disclosed two new vulnerabilities affecting Schneider Electric Modicon programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that could allow for authentication bypass and remote code execution. The flaws, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-45788 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5) and&nbsp; CVE-2022-45789 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.1), are part of a&nbsp; broader collection &nbsp;of&nbsp; security defects &nbsp;tracked by Forescout as OT:ICEFALL. Successful exploitation of the bugs could enable an adversary to execute unauthorized code, denial-of-service, or disclosure of sensitive information. The cybersecurity company said the shortcomings can be chained by a threat actor with known flaws from other vendors (e.g.,&nbsp; CVE-2021-31886 ) to achieve deep lateral movement in operational technology (OT) networks. "Deep lateral movement lets attackers gain deep access to industrial control systems and cross often overlooked security perimeters, allowing them to perform highly granular and stealthy manipulations as well as override funct

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple on Monday rolled out security updates for&nbsp; iOS, iPadOS ,&nbsp; macOS , and&nbsp; Safari &nbsp;to address a zero-day flaw that it said has been actively exploited in the wild. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-23529 , the issue relates to a type confusion bug in the WebKit browser engine that could be activated when processing maliciously crafted web content, culminating in arbitrary code execution. The iPhone maker said the bug was addressed with improved checks, adding it's "aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited." An anonymous researcher has been credited with reporting the flaw. It's not immediately clear as to how the vulnerability is being exploited in real-world attacks, but it's the second actively abused type confusion flaw in WebKit to be patched by Apple after&nbsp; CVE-2022-42856 &nbsp;in as many months, which was closed in December 2022.&nbsp; WebKit flaws are also notable for the fact that they impact every third-party web browser that's available fo

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A set of 38 security vulnerabilities has been uncovered in wireless industrial internet of things (IIoT) devices from four different vendors that could pose a significant attack surface for threat actors looking to exploit operational technology (OT) environments. "Threat actors can exploit vulnerabilities in Wireless IIoT devices to gain initial access to internal OT networks," Israeli industrial cybersecurity company Otorio&nbsp; said . "They can use these vulnerabilities to bypass security layers and infiltrate target networks, putting critical infrastructure at risk or interrupting manufacturing." The flaws, in a nutshell, offer a remote entry point for attack, enabling unauthenticated adversaries to gain a foothold and subsequently use it as leverage to spread to other hosts, thereby causing significant damage. Some of the identified shortcomings could be chained to give an external actor direct access to thousands of internal OT networks over the internet, secu

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The OpenSSL Project has released fixes to address several security flaws, including a high-severity bug in the open source encryption toolkit that could potentially expose users to malicious attacks. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-0286 , the issue relates to a case of type confusion that may permit an adversary to "read memory contents or enact a denial-of-service," the maintainers said in an advisory. The vulnerability is rooted in the way the&nbsp; popular cryptographic library &nbsp;handles X.509 certificates, and is likely to impact only those applications that have a custom implementation for retrieving a certificate revocation list ( CRL ) over a network. "In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature," OpenSSL&nbsp; said . "If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon."

Multiple unpatched security flaws have been disclosed in open source and freemium Document Management System (DMS) offerings from four vendors LogicalDOC, Mayan, ONLYOFFICE, and OpenKM. Cybersecurity firm Rapid7 said the eight vulnerabilities offer a mechanism through which "an attacker can convince a human operator to save a malicious document on the platform and, once the document is indexed and triggered by the user, giving the attacker multiple paths to control the organization." The list of eight cross-site scripting ( XSS ) flaws, discovered by Rapid7 researcher Matthew Kienow, is as follows - CVE-2022-47412 &nbsp;- ONLYOFFICE Workspace Search Stored XSS CVE-2022-47413 and CVE-2022-47414 &nbsp;- OpenKM Document and Application XSS CVE-2022-47415, CVE-2022-47416, CVE-2022-47417, and CVE-2022-47418 &nbsp;- LogicalDOC Multiple Stored XSS CVE-2022-47419 &nbsp;- Mayan EDMS Tag Stored XSS Stored XSS, also known as persistent XSS, occurs when a malicious script is injected directly into

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are leveraging known flaws in Sunlogin software to deploy the Sliver command-and-control (C2) framework for carrying out post-exploitation activities. The findings come from AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC), which found that security vulnerabilities in Sunlogin, a remote desktop program developed in China, are being abused to deploy a wide range of payloads. "Not only did threat actors use the Sliver backdoor, but they also used the&nbsp; BYOVD &nbsp;(Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) malware to incapacitate security products and install reverse shells," the researchers&nbsp; said . Attack chains commence with the exploitation of two remote code execution bugs in Sunlogin versions prior to v11.0.0.33 (CNVD-2022-03672 and CNVD-2022-10270), followed by delivering Sliver or other malware such as&nbsp; Gh0st RAT &nbsp;and XMRig crypto coin miner.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The maintainers of OpenSSH have released OpenSSH 9.2 to address a number of security bugs, including a memory safety vulnerability in the OpenSSH server (sshd). Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-25136 , the shortcoming has been classified as a pre-authentication double free vulnerability that was introduced in version 9.1. "This is not believed to be exploitable, and it occurs in the unprivileged pre-auth process that is subject to chroot(2) and is further sandboxed on most major platforms," OpenSSH disclosed in its&nbsp; release notes &nbsp;on February 2, 2023. Credited with&nbsp; reporting &nbsp;the flaw to OpenSSH in July 2022 is security researcher Mantas Mikulenas. OpenSSH is the open source implementation of the secure shell ( SSH ) protocol that offers a suite of services for encrypted communications over an unsecured network in a client-server architecture.

A zero-day vulnerability affecting Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT managed file transfer application is being actively exploited in the wild. Details of the flaw were first&nbsp; publicly shared &nbsp;by security reporter Brian Krebs on Mastodon. No public advisory has been published by Fortra. The vulnerability is a case of remote code injection that requires access to the administrative console of the application, making it imperative that the systems are not exposed to the public internet. According to security researcher&nbsp;Kevin Beaumont, there are over 1,000 on-premise instances that are publicly accessible over the internet, a majority of which are located in the U.S. "The Fortra advisory Krebs quoted advises GoAnywhere MFT customers to review all administrative users and monitor for unrecognized usernames, especially those created by system," Rapid7 researcher Caitlin Condon&nbsp; said .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two new security weaknesses discovered in several electric vehicle (EV) charging systems could be exploited to remotely shut down charging stations and even expose them to data and energy theft. The findings, which come from Israel-based SaiFlow, once again demonstrate the&nbsp; potential risks &nbsp;facing the EV charging infrastructure. The issues have been identified in version 1.6J of the Open Charge Point Protocol ( OCPP ) standard that uses WebSockets for communication between EV charging stations and the Charging Station Management System (CSMS) providers. The current version of OCPP is 2.0.1. "The OCPP standard doesn't define how a CSMS should accept new connections from a charge point when there is already an active connection," SaiFlow researchers Lionel Richard Saposnik and Doron Porat&nbsp; said . "The lack of a clear guideline for multiple active connections can be exploited by attackers to disrupt and hijack the connection between the charge point and the CSMS.&amp;q

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of two security flaws in the open source&nbsp; ImageMagick software &nbsp;that could potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) and information disclosure. The two issues, which were identified by Latin American cybersecurity firm Metabase Q in version 7.1.0-49, were&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;in ImageMagick&nbsp; version 7.1.0-52 , released in November 2022. A brief description of the flaws is as follows - CVE-2022-44267 &nbsp;- A DoS vulnerability that arises when parsing a PNG image with a filename that's a single dash ("-") CVE-2022-44268 &nbsp;- An information disclosure vulnerability that could be exploited to read arbitrary files from a server when parsing an image That said, an attacker must be able to upload a malicious image to a website using ImageMagick so as to weaponize the flaws remotely. The specially crafted image, for its part, can be created by inserting a&nbsp; text chunk &nbsp;that specifies some metadata of the attacker's choice (e.g.,

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two more supply chain security flaws have been disclosed in AMI MegaRAC Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) software, nearly two months after&nbsp; three security vulnerabilities &nbsp;were brought to light in the same product. Firmware security firm Eclypsium&nbsp; said &nbsp;the two shortcomings were held back until now to provide AMI additional time to engineer appropriate mitigations. The issues, collectively tracked as&nbsp; BMC&amp;C , could act as springboard for cyber attacks, enabling threat actors to obtain remote code execution and unauthorized device access with superuser permissions. The two new flaws in question are as follows - CVE-2022-26872 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.3) - ​​Password reset interception via API CVE-2022-40258 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 5.3) - Weak password hashes for Redfish and API Specifically, MegaRAC has been found to use the MD5 hashing algorithm with a global salt for older devices, or&nbsp; SHA-512 with per user salts &nbsp;on newer appliances, potentially allowing a threat actor to crack the

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Taiwanese company QNAP has released updates to remediate a critical security flaw affecting its network-attached storage (NAS) devices that could lead to arbitrary code injection. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-27596 , the vulnerability is rated 9.8 out of a maximum of 10 on the CVSS scoring scale. It affects QTS 5.0.1 and QuTS hero h5.0.1. "If exploited, this vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject malicious code," QNAP&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory released Monday. The exact technical specifics surrounding the flaw are unclear, but the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) has categorized it as an SQL injection vulnerability. This means an attacker could send specially crafted SQL queries such that they could be weaponized to bypass security controls and access or alter valuable information. "Just as it may be possible to read sensitive information, it is also possible to make changes or even delete this information with a SQL injection attack," according to&nbsp; MI

Microsoft is urging customers to keep their Exchange servers updated as well as take steps to bolster the environment, such as enabling&nbsp; Windows Extended Protection &nbsp;and configuring&nbsp; certificate-based signing &nbsp;of PowerShell serialization payloads. "Attackers looking to exploit unpatched Exchange servers are not going to go away," the tech giant's Exchange Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post. "There are too many aspects of unpatched on-premises Exchange environments that are valuable to bad actors looking to exfiltrate data or commit other malicious acts." Microsoft also emphasized mitigations issued by the company are only a stopgap solution and that they can "become insufficient to protect against all variations of an attack," necessitating that users install necessary security updates to secure the servers.

Age of VOC findings Our Vulnerability Scans are performed on a recurring basis, which provides us the opportunity to examine the difference between when a scan was performed on an Asset, and when a given finding on that Asset was reported. We can call that the finding 'Age'. If the findings first reported are not addressed, they will occur in more scans over time with increasing Age, and so we can track how the Age of reported findings changes over time. As the chart below clearly illustrates, the majority of real findings in our dataset, across all Severity levels, are between 75 and 225 days old. There is a second 'peak' at around 300 days, which we suspect has more to do with the age of the data in the dataset and can therefore be ignored. Finally, there is a fascinating 

Chinese Hackers Exploited Recent Fortinet Flaw as 0-Day to Drop Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/new-chinese-malware-spotted-exploiting.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected China-nexus threat actor exploited a recently patched vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS SSL-VPN as a zero-day in attacks targeting a European government entity and a managed service provider (MSP) located in Africa. Telemetry evidence gathered by Google-owned Mandiant indicates that the exploitation occurred as early as October 2022, at least nearly two months before fixes were released. "This incident continues China's pattern of exploiting internet facing devices, specifically those used for managed security purposes (e.g., firewalls, IPS\IDS appliances etc.)," Mandiant researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. The attacks entailed the use of a sophisticated backdoor dubbed&nbsp; BOLDMOVE , a Linux variant of which is specifically designed to run on Fortinet's FortiGate firewalls. The intrusion vector in question relates to the exploitation of&nbsp; CVE-2022-42475 , a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in FortiOS SSL-VPN that could result in unauthenti

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new critical remote code execution (RCE) flaw discovered impacting multiple services related to Microsoft Azure could be exploited by a malicious actor to completely take control of a targeted application. "The vulnerability is achieved through&nbsp; CSRF &nbsp;(cross-site request forgery) on the ubiquitous SCM service Kudu," Ermetic researcher Liv Matan&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "By abusing the vulnerability, attackers can deploy malicious ZIP files containing a payload to the victim's Azure application." The Israeli cloud infrastructure security firm, which dubbed the shortcoming&nbsp; EmojiDeploy , said it could further enable the theft of sensitive data and lateral movement to other Azure services. Microsoft has since fixed the vulnerability as of December 6, 2022, following responsible disclosure on October 26, 2022, in addition to awarding a bug bounty of $30,000.

Security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Netcomm and TP-Link routers, some of which could be weaponized to achieve remote code execution. The flaws, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-4873 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2022-4874 , concern a case of stack-based buffer overflow and authentication bypass and impact Netcomm router models NF20MESH, NF20, and NL1902 running firmware versions earlier than R6B035 . "The two vulnerabilities, when chained together, permit a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code," the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published Tuesday. "The attacker can first gain unauthorized access to affected devices, and then use those entry points to gain access to other networks or compromise the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of data being transmitted from the internal network."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco has warned of two security vulnerabilities affecting end-of-life (EoL) Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, and RV082 routers that it said will not be fixed, even as it acknowledged the public availability of proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit. The&nbsp; issues &nbsp;are rooted in the router's web-based management interface, enabling a remote adversary to sidestep authentication or execute malicious commands on the underlying operating system. The most severe of the two is CVE-2023-20025 (CVSS score: 9.0), which is the result of improper validation of user input within incoming HTTP packets. A threat actor could exploit it remotely by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to vulnerable routers' web-based management interface to bypass authentication and obtain elevated permissions. The lack of adequate validation is also the reason behind the second flaw tracked as CVE-2023-20026 (CVSS score: 6.5), permitting an attacker with valid admin credentials to achieve root-level privi

Security researchers have disclosed multiple architectural vulnerabilities in Siemens SIMATIC and SIPLUS S7-1500 programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that could be exploited by a malicious actor to stealthily install firmware on affected devices and take control of them. Discovered by Red Balloon Security , the issues are tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-38773 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 4.6), with the low severity stemming from the prerequisite that exploitation requires physical tampering of the device. The flaws "could allow attackers to bypass all protected boot features, resulting in persistent arbitrary modification of operating code and data," the company&nbsp; said . More than 100 models are susceptible. Put differently, the weaknesses are the result of a lack of asymmetric signature verifications for firmware at bootup, effectively permitting the attacker to load tainted bootloader and firmware while undermining integrity protections.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a now-patched vulnerability in Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers that, if successfully exploited, could have made it possible to siphon files containing confidential data. "The issue arose from the way the browser interacted with&nbsp; symlinks &nbsp;when processing files and directories," Imperva researcher Ron Masas&nbsp; said . "Specifically, the browser did not properly check if the symlink was pointing to a location that was not intended to be accessible, which allowed for the theft of sensitive files." Google characterized the medium-severity issue (CVE-2022-3656) as a case of insufficient data validation in File System,&nbsp; releasing &nbsp; fixes &nbsp;for it in versions 107 and 108 released in October and November 2022. Dubbed SymStealer, the vulnerability, at its core, relates to a type of weakness known as symbolic link (aka symlink) following, which&nbsp; occurs &nbsp;when an attacker abuses the feature to bypass the file system restrictions of a progra

Malicious actors are actively attempting to exploit a recently patched critical vulnerability in Control Web Panel (CWP) that enables elevated privileges and unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on susceptible servers. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-44877 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the bug impacts all versions of the software before 0.9.8.1147 and was&nbsp; patched &nbsp;by its maintainers on October 25, 2022. Control Web Panel, formerly known as CentOS Web Panel, is a popular server administration tool for enterprise-based Linux systems. "login/index.php in CWP (aka Control Web Panel or CentOS Web Panel) 7 before 0.9.8.1147 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via shell metacharacters in the login parameter," according to&nbsp; NIST . Gais Security researcher Numan Turle has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw to the Control Web Panel developers. Exploitation of the flaw is said to have commenced on January 6, 2023, following the&nbsp; availability &nbsp;of a proof

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A comprehensive analysis of the cryptographic protocols used in the Swiss encrypted messaging application Threema has revealed a number of loopholes that could be exploited to break authentication protections and even recover users' private keys. The seven attacks span three different threat models,&nbsp; according &nbsp;to ETH Zurich researchers Kenneth G. Paterson, Matteo Scarlata, and Kien Tuong Truong, who reported the issues to Threema on October 3, 2022. The weaknesses have since been addressed as part of&nbsp; updates &nbsp;released by the company on November 29, 2022. Threema is an encrypted messaging app that's used by more than 11 million users as of October 2022. "Security and privacy are deeply ingrained in Threema's DNA," the company&nbsp; claims &nbsp;on its website. Officially used by the Swiss Government and the Swiss Army, it's also advertised as a secure alternative alongside other services such as Signal, Meta-owned WhatsApp, and Telegram.

A high-severity security flaw has been disclosed in the open source jsonwebtoken (JWT) library that, if successfully exploited, could lead to remote code execution on a target server. "By exploiting this&nbsp; vulnerability , attackers could achieve remote code execution (RCE) on a server verifying a maliciously crafted JSON web token (JWT) request," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researcher Artur Oleyarsh&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday report.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics has demonstrated novel attacks that leverage Text-to-SQL models to produce malicious code that could enable adversaries to glean sensitive information and stage denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. "To better interact with users, a wide range of database applications employ AI techniques that can translate human questions into SQL queries (namely&nbsp; Text-to-SQL ),"&nbsp; Xutan Peng , a researcher at the University of Sheffield, told The Hacker News. "We found that by asking some specially designed questions, crackers can fool Text-to-SQL models to produce malicious code. As such code is automatically executed on the database, the consequence can be pretty severe (e.g., data breaches and DoS attacks)." The&nbsp; findings , which were validated against two commercial solutions&nbsp; BAIDU-UNIT &nbsp;and&nbsp; AI2sql , mark the first empirical instance where natural language processing (NLP) models have been exploited as an attack vector in the wild.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
IBM has fixed a high-severity security vulnerability affecting its Cloud Databases (ICD) for PostgreSQL product that could be potentially exploited to tamper with internal repositories and run unauthorized code.  The privilege escalation flaw (CVSS score: 8.8), dubbed " Hell's Keychain " by cloud security firm Wiz, has been described as a "first-of-its-kind supply-chain attack vector impacting a cloud provider's infrastructure."  Successful exploitation of the bug could enable a malicious actor to remotely execute code in customers' environments and even read or modify data stored in the PostgreSQL database.   "The vulnerability consists of a chain of three exposed secrets (Kubernetes service account token, private container registry password, CI/CD server credentials) coupled with overly permissive network access to internal build servers," Wiz researchers Ronen Shustin and Shir Tamari&nbsp; said .  Hell's Keychain commences with an SQL inject

A critical security vulnerability has been disclosed in the Quarkus Java framework that could be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution on affected systems.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-4116 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the shortcoming could be trivially abused by a malicious actor without any privileges.  "The vulnerability is found in the Dev UI Config Editor, which is vulnerable to drive-by localhost attacks that could lead to remote-code execution (RCE)," Contrast Security researcher Joseph Beeton, who reported the bug,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up.   Quarkus, developed by Red Hat, is an&nbsp; open source project &nbsp;that's used for creating Java applications in&nbsp; containerized &nbsp;and serverless environments.  It's worth pointing out that the&nbsp; issue &nbsp;only impacts developers who are running Quarkus and are tricked into visiting a specially crafted website, which is embedded with malicious JavaScript code designed to install or execute arbitrary payloads.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New findings from cybersecurity firm JFrog show that malware targeting the npm ecosystem can evade security checks by taking advantage of an "unexpected behavior" in the npm command line interface (CLI) tool.  npm CLI's&nbsp; install &nbsp;and&nbsp; audit &nbsp; commands &nbsp;have built-in capabilities to check a package and all of its dependencies for known vulnerabilities, effectively acting as a warning mechanism for developers by highlighting the flaws.  But as JFrog established, the security advisories are not displayed when the packages follow certain version formats, creating a scenario where critical flaws could be introduced into their systems either directly or via the package's dependencies.   Specifically, the problem arises only when the installed package version contains a hyphen (e.g., 1.2.3-a), which is included to denote a&nbsp; pre-release version &nbsp;of an npm module.  While the project maintainers treat the discrepancy between regular npm package versions and pre-release version

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The French data protection watchdog on Tuesday fined electricity provider Électricité de France  €600,000 for violating the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements.  The Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (CNIL)&nbsp; said &nbsp;the electric utility breached European regulation by storing the passwords for over 25,800 accounts by hashing them using the&nbsp; MD5 algorithm &nbsp;as recently as July 2022.  It's worth noting that MD5, a message digest algorithm, is considered cryptographically broken as of December 2008  owing to the risk of&nbsp; collision attacks .   Furthermore, the authority noted that the passwords associated with 2,414,254 customer accounts had only been hashed and not&nbsp; salted , exposing the account holders to potential cyber threats.  The probe also pointed fingers at EDF for failing to comply with GDPR data retention policies and for providing "inaccurate information on the origin of the data collected."  "The amoun

Researchers have disclosed details of three new security vulnerabilities affecting operational technology (OT) products from CODESYS and Festo that could lead to source code tampering and denial-of-service (DoS).  The vulnerabilities, reported by Forescout Vedere Labs, are the latest in a long list of flaws collectively tracked under the name&nbsp; OT:ICEFALL .

The most critical of the flaws is&nbsp; CVE-2022-3270 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), a critical vulnerability that affects Festo automation controllers using the Festo Generic Multicast (FGMC) protocol to reboot the devices without requiring any authentication and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Acer has released a firmware update to address a security vulnerability that could be potentially weaponized to turn off UEFI Secure Boot on affected machines.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-4020 , the high-severity vulnerability affects five different models that consist of Aspire A315-22, A115-21, and A315-22G, and Extensa EX215-21 and EX215-21G.   The PC maker described the vulnerability as an issue that "may allow changes to Secure Boot settings by creating NVRAM variables." Credited with&nbsp; discovering &nbsp;the flaw is ESET researcher Martin Smolár, who previously disclosed&nbsp; similar bugs &nbsp;in Lenovo computers.  Disabling Secure Boot, an integrity mechanism that guarantees that only trusted software is loaded during system startup, enables a malicious actor to tamper with&nbsp; boot loaders , leading to severe consequences.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Amazon Web Services (AWS) has resolved a cross-tenant vulnerability in its platform that could be weaponized by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to resources.  The issue relates to a&nbsp; confused deputy problem , a type of privilege escalation where a program that doesn't have permission to perform an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform the action.  The shortcoming was reported by Datadog to AWS on September 1, 2022, following which a patch was shipped on September 6.  "This attack abuses the AppSync service to assume [identity and access management]&nbsp; roles &nbsp;in other AWS accounts, which allows an attacker to pivot into a victim organization and access resources in those accounts," Datadog researcher Nick Frichette&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Over a dozen security flaws have been discovered in baseboard management controller ( BMC ) firmware from Lanner that could expose operational technology (OT) and internet of things (IoT) networks to remote attacks.  BMC refers to a specialized service processor, a system-on-chip (SoC), that's found in server motherboards and is used for remote monitoring and management of a host system, including performing low-level system operations such as&nbsp; firmware flashing &nbsp;and power control.   Nozomi Networks, which analyzed an Intelligent Platform Management Interface ( IPMC ) from Taiwanese vendor Lanner Electronics, said it uncovered 13 weaknesses affecting&nbsp; IAC-AST2500 .  All the issues affect version 1.10.0 of the standard firmware, with the exception of CVE-2021-4228, which impacts version 1.00.0. Four of the flaws (from CVE-2021-26727 to CVE-2021-26730) are rated 10 out of 10 on the CVSS scoring system.   In particular, the industrial security company found that CVE-2021-44467, an ac

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Thursday released software updates to address yet another zero-day flaw in its Chrome web browser.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-4135 , the high-severity vulnerability has been described as a heap buffer overflow in the GPU component. Clement Lecigne of Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been credited with reporting the flaw on November 22, 2022.  Heap-based buffer overflow bugs can be&nbsp; weaponized &nbsp;by threat actors to crash a program or execute arbitrary code, leading to unintended behavior.  According to the NIST's National Vulnerability Database, the flaw could  permit a "remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page."  "Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2022-4135 exists in the wild," the tech giant&nbsp; acknowledged &nbsp;in an advisory.  But like other actively exploited issues, technical specifics have been withheld until a majority of the users are updated with a fix and t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of firmware images across devices from Dell, HP, and Lenovo has revealed the presence of outdated versions of the&nbsp; OpenSSL &nbsp;cryptographic library, underscoring a supply chain risk.  EFI Development Kit, aka&nbsp; EDK , is an open source implementation of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ), which functions as an interface between the operating system and the firmware embedded in the device's hardware.  The firmware development environment, which is in its second iteration (EDK II), comes with its own cryptographic package called&nbsp; CryptoPkg &nbsp;that, in turn, makes use of services from the OpenSSL project.   Per firmware security company Binarly, the firmware image associated with Lenovo Thinkpad enterprise devices was found to use three different versions of OpenSSL: 0.9.8zb, 1.0.0a, and 1.0.2j, the last of which was released in 2018.  What's more, one of the firmware modules named InfineonTpmUpdateDxe relied on OpenSSL version 0.9.8zb that was shipped on Au

A set of five medium-severity security flaws in Arm's Mali GPU driver has continued to remain unpatched on Android devices for months, despite fixes released by the chipmaker.

"These fixes have not yet made it downstream to affected Android devices (including Pixel, Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, and others)," Project Zero researcher Ian Beer&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "Devices with a Mali GPU are currently vulnerable."  The vulnerabilities, collectively tracked under the identifiers&nbsp; CVE-2022-33917 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 5.5) and&nbsp; CVE-2022-36449 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.5), concern a case of improper memory processing, thereby allowing a non-privileged user to gain access to freed memory.   The second flaw, CVE-2022-36449, can be further weaponized to write outside of buffer bounds and disclose details of memory mappings, according to an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;issued by Arm. The lis

Australian software company Atlassian has rolled out security updates to address&nbsp; two critical flaws &nbsp;affecting Bitbucket Server, Data Center, and Crowd products.  The issues, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-43781 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2022-43782 , are both rated 9 out of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system.  CVE-2022-43781, which Atlassian said was introduced in version 7.0.0 of Bitbucket Server and Data Center, affects versions 7.0 to 7.21 and 8.0 to 8.4 (only if mesh.enabled is set to false in bitbucket.properties).   The weakness has been described as a case of command injection using environment variables in the software, which could allow an adversary with permission to control their username to gain code execution on the affected system.  As a temporary workaround, the company is recommending users turn off the "Public Signup" option (Administration &gt; Authentication).

Critical RCE Flaw Reported in Spotify's Backstage Software Catalog and Developer Platform<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/critical-rce-flaw-reported-in-spotifys.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Spotify's Backstage has been discovered as vulnerable to a severe security flaw that could be exploited to gain remote code execution by leveraging a recently disclosed bug in a third-party module.  The vulnerability (CVSS score: 9.8), at its core, takes advantage of a critical sandbox escape in vm2, a popular JavaScript sandbox library ( CVE-2022-36067 &nbsp;aka Sandbreak), that came to light last month.  "An unauthenticated threat actor can execute arbitrary system commands on a Backstage application by exploiting a vm2 sandbox escape in the Scaffolder core plugin," application security firm Oxeye said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.   Backstage &nbsp;is an open source&nbsp; developer portal &nbsp;from Spotify that allows users to create, manage, and explore software components from a unified " front door ." It's used by&nbsp; many companies &nbsp;like Netflix, DoorDash, Roku, and Expedia, among others.  According to Oxeye, the flaw is rooted in a tool called&nbsp; software templ

Credit:&nbsp;Marina Minkin  A novel attack method has been disclosed against a crucial piece of technology called time-triggered ethernet ( TTE ) that's used in safety-critical infrastructure, potentially causing the failure of systems powering spacecraft and aircraft.  Dubbed&nbsp; PCspooF &nbsp;by a group of academics and researchers from the University of Michigan , the University of Pennsylvania, and the NASA Johnson Space Center, the&nbsp; technique &nbsp;is designed to break TTE's security guarantees and induce TTE devices to lose synchronization for up to a second, a behavior that can even lead to uncontrolled maneuvers in spaceflight missions and threaten crew safety.  TTE  is one among the networking technologies that's part of what's called a mixed-criticality network wherein traffic with different timing and faults tolerance requirements coexist in the same physical network. This means that both critical devices, which, say, enable vehicle control, and non-critical devices, which are

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of now-patched flaws in Zendesk Explore that could have been exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to information from customer accounts that have the feature turned on.  "Before it was patched, the flaw would have allowed threat actors to access conversations, email addresses, tickets, comments, and other information from Zendesk accounts with Explore enabled," Varonis&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The cybersecurity firm said there was no evidence to suggest that the issues were actively exploited in real-world attacks. No action is required on the part of the customers.   Zendesk Explore is a&nbsp; reporting and analytics solution &nbsp;that allows organizations to "view and analyze key information about your customers, and your support resources."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple high-severity flaws have been uncovered in the open source OpenLiteSpeed Web Server as well as its enterprise variant that could be weaponized to achieve remote code execution.  "By chaining and exploiting the vulnerabilities, adversaries could compromise the web server and gain fully privileged remote code execution," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday report.   OpenLiteSpeed , the open source edition of LiteSpeed Web Server, is the sixth most popular web server, accounting for 1.9 million unique servers across the world.  The first of the three flaws is a directory traversal flaw ( CVE-2022-0072 , CVSS score: 5.8), which could be exploited to access forbidden files in the web root directory.   The remaining two vulnerabilities ( CVE-2022-0073 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2022-0074 , CVSS scores: 8.8) relate to a case of privilege escalation and command injection, respectively, that could be chained to achieve privileged code execution.

VMware has patched five security flaws affecting its&nbsp; Workspace ONE Assist &nbsp;solution, some of which could be exploited to bypass authentication and obtain elevated permissions.  Topping the list are three critical vulnerabilities tracked as CVE-2022-31685, CVE-2022-31686, and CVE-2022-31687. All the shortcomings are rated 9.8 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system.  CVE-2022-31685 is an authentication bypass flaw that could be abused by an attacker with network access to VMware Workspace ONE Assist to obtain administrative access without the need to authenticate to the application.   CVE-2022-31686 has been described by the virtualization services provider as a "broken authentication method" vulnerability, and CVE-2022-31687 as a "Broken Access Control" flaw.  "A malicious actor with network access may be able to obtain administrative access without the need to authenticate to the application," VMware&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory for CVE-2022-31686 and CVE-202

Microsoft is warning of an uptick among nation-state and criminal actors increasingly leveraging publicly-disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities for breaching target environments.  The tech giant, in its 114-page&nbsp; Digital Defense Report , said it has "observed a reduction in the time between the announcement of a vulnerability and the commoditization of that vulnerability," making it imperative that organizations patch such exploits in a timely manner.  This also corroborates with an April 2022 advisory from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which&nbsp; found &nbsp;that bad actors are "aggressively" targeting newly disclosed software bugs against broad targets globally.   Microsoft noted that it only takes 14 days on average for an exploit to be available in the wild after public disclosure of a flaw, stating that while zero-day attacks are initially limited in scope, they tend to be swiftly adopted by other threat actors, leading to indiscriminat

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The OpenSSL project has rolled out fixes to contain two high-severity flaws in its widely used cryptography library that could result in a denial-of-service (DoS) and remote code execution.  The issues, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 , have been described as buffer overrun vulnerabilities that can be triggered during X.509 certificate verification by supplying a specially-crafted email address.  "In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server," OpenSSL said in an advisory for CVE-2022-3786. "In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects."   OpenSSL is an&nbsp; open source implementation &nbsp;of the SSL and TLS protocols used for secure communication and is baked into several operating systems and a wide range of software.  Versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6 of the library are affected by the new flaws, which has been remediated in version 3.0.7. It's worth noting tha

Microsoft on Tuesday said it addressed an authentication bypass vulnerability in&nbsp; Jupyter Notebooks &nbsp;for Azure Cosmos DB that enabled full read and write access.  The tech giant said the problem was introduced on August 12, 2022, and rectified worldwide on October 6, 2022, two days after responsible disclosure from Orca Security, which dubbed the flaw&nbsp; CosMiss .  "In short, if an attacker had knowledge of a Notebook's 'forwardingId,' which is the UUID of the Notebook Workspace, they would have had full permissions on the Notebook without having to authenticate, including read and write access, and the ability to modify the file system of the container running the notebook," researchers Lidor Ben Shitrit and Roee Sagi said.   This container modification could ultimately pave the way for obtaining remote code execution in the Notebook container by overwriting a Python file associated with the&nbsp; Cosmos DB Explorer &nbsp;to spawn a reverse shell.

Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux and Git, has his own law in software development, and it goes like this: " given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow ." This phrase puts the finger on the very principle of open source: the more, the merrier - if the code is easily available for anyone and everyone to fix bugs, it's pretty safe. But is it? Or is the saying "all bugs are shallow" only true for&nbsp; shallow &nbsp;bugs and not ones that lie deeper? It turns out that security flaws in open source can be harder to find than we thought. Emil Wåreus, Head of R&amp;D at&nbsp; Debricked , took it upon himself to look deeper into the community's performance. As the data scientist he is, he, of course, asked the data:&nbsp; how good is the open source community at finding vulnerabilities in a timely manner ?  The thrill of the (vulnerability) hunt  Finding open source vulnerabilities is typically done by the maintainers of the open source project, users, auditors, or external secur

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
IT service management software platform ConnectWise has released Software patches for a critical security vulnerability in Recover and R1Soft Server Backup Manager (SBM).  The issue,&nbsp; characterized &nbsp;as a "neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component," could be abused to result in the execution of remote code or disclosure of sensitive information.  ConnectWise's advisory notes that the flaw affects Recover v2.9.7 and earlier, as well as R1Soft SBM v6.16.3 and earlier, are impacted by the critical flaw.   At its core, the issue is tied to an upstream authentication bypass vulnerability in the ZK open source Ajax web application framework ( CVE-2022-36537 ), which was initially patched in May 2022.   "Affected ConnectWise Recover SBMs have automatically been updated to the latest version of Recover (v2.9.9)," the company&nbsp; said , urging customers to upgrade to&nbsp; SBM v6.16.4 &nbsp;shipped on October 28, 2022.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unofficial patch has been made available for an actively exploited security flaw in Microsoft Windows that makes it possible for files signed with malformed signatures to sneak past Mark-of-the-Web ( MotW ) protections.  The fix,&nbsp; released &nbsp;by 0patch, arrives weeks after HP Wolf Security&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a Magniber ransomware campaign that targets users with fake security updates which employ a JavaScript file to proliferate the file-encrypting malware.   While files downloaded from the internet in Windows are tagged with a MotW flag to prevent unauthorized actions, it has since been found that corrupt Authenticode signatures can be used to allow the execution of arbitrary executables without any&nbsp; SmartScreen warning .  Authenticode &nbsp;is a Microsoft code-signing technology that authenticates the identity of the publisher of a particular piece of software and verifies whether the software was tampered with after it was signed and published.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-patched security flaw has been disclosed in the Galaxy Store app for Samsung devices that could potentially trigger remote command execution on affected phones.  The vulnerability, which affects Galaxy Store version 4.5.32.4, relates to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug that occurs when handling certain&nbsp; deep links . An independent security researcher has been credited with reporting the issue.  "Here, by not checking the deep link securely, when a user accesses a link from a website containing the deeplink, the attacker can execute JS code in the webview context of the Galaxy Store application," SSD Secure Disclosure&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory posted last week.   XSS attacks &nbsp;allow an adversary to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code when visiting a website from a browser or another application.   The issue identified in the Galaxy Store app has to do with how deep links are configured for Samsung's Marketing &amp; Content Service ( MCS ), potentially leading to

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud-based repository hosting service GitHub has addressed a high-severity security flaw that could have been exploited to create malicious repositories and mount supply chain attacks.  The RepoJacking  technique,&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by Checkmarx, entails a bypass of a protection mechanism called&nbsp; popular repository namespace retirement , which aims to prevent developers from pulling unsafe repositories with the same name.  The issue was addressed by the Microsoft-owned subsidiary on September 19, 2022 following responsible disclosure.   RepoJacking&nbsp; occurs &nbsp;when a creator of a repository opts to change the username, potentially enabling a threat actor to claim the old username and publish a rogue repository with the same name in an attempt to trick users into downloading them.   While Microsoft's countermeasure "retire[s] the namespace of any open source project that had more than 100 clones in the week leading up to the owner's account being renamed or deleted," Checkmarx

Multiple high-severity security flaws have been disclosed as affecting Juniper Networks devices, some of which could be exploited to achieve code execution.  Chief among them is a remote pre-authenticated PHP archive file deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2022-22241, CVSS score: 8.1) in the J-Web component of Junos OS, according to Octagon Networks researcher Paulos Yibelo.  "This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker to get remote phar files deserialized, leading to arbitrary file write, which leads to a remote code execution (RCE)," Yibelo&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.   Also identified are five other issues, which are listed as follow -   CVE-2022-22242 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.1) - A pre-authenticated reflected&nbsp; XSS &nbsp;on the error page ("error.php"), allowing a remote adversary to siphon Junos OS admin session and chained with other flaws that require authentication.

A now-patched security flaw in Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems could have potentially enabled apps with Bluetooth access to eavesdrop on conversations with Siri.

"Any app with access to Bluetooth could record your conversations with Siri and audio from the iOS keyboard dictation feature when using AirPods or Beats headsets," Rambo&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up.   "This would happen without the app requesting microphone access permission and without the app leaving any trace that it was listening to the microphone."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco has warned of active exploitation attempts targeting a pair of two-year-old security flaws in the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2020-3153 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.5) and&nbsp; CVE-2020-3433 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), the vulnerabilities could enable local authenticated attackers to perform DLL hijacking and copy arbitrary files to system directories with elevated privileges.&nbsp;  While CVE-2020-3153 was addressed by Cisco in February 2020, a fix for CVE-2020-3433 was shipped in August 2020.   "In October 2022, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team became aware of additional attempted exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild," the networking equipment maker said in an updated advisory.  "Cisco continues to strongly recommend that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this vulnerability."  The alert comes as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) moved to add the two flaws to its K

VMware Releases Patch for Critical RCE Flaw in Cloud Foundation Platform<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/vmware-releases-patch-for-critical-rce.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware on Tuesday shipped security updates to address a critical security flaw in its VMware Cloud Foundation product.  Tracked as CVE-2021-39144, the issue has been rated 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system, and relates to a remote code execution vulnerability via XStream open source library.  "Due to an unauthenticated endpoint that leverages XStream for input serialization in VMware Cloud Foundation (NSX-V), a malicious actor can get remote code execution in the context of 'root' on the appliance," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory.   In light of the severity of the flaw and its relatively low bar for exploitation, the Palo Alto-based virtualization services provider has also made available a&nbsp; patch &nbsp;for end-of-life products.  Also addressed by VMware as part of the update is CVE-2022-31678 (CVSS score: 5.3), an XML External Entity ( XXE ) vulnerability that could be exploited to result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or unauthorized info

A high-severity vulnerability has been disclosed in the SQLite database library, which was introduced as part of a code change dating all the way back to October 2000 and could enable attackers to crash or control programs.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-35737 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5), the 22-year-old issue affects SQLite versions&nbsp; 1.0.12 &nbsp;through 3.39.1, and has been addressed in&nbsp; version 3.39.2 &nbsp;released on July 21, 2022.   "CVE-2022-35737 is&nbsp; exploitable &nbsp;on 64-bit systems, and exploitability depends on how the program is compiled," Trail of Bits researcher Andreas Kellas&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published today.  "Arbitrary code execution is confirmed when the library is compiled without stack canaries, but unconfirmed when stack canaries are present, and denial-of-service is confirmed in all cases."   Programmed in C, SQLite  is the most widely used  database engine , included by default in Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS, as well as popular web browsers such as Googl

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details about a pair of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, one of which could be exploited to result in a denial-of-service (DoS).  The exploits, dubbed&nbsp; LogCrusher &nbsp;and&nbsp; OverLog &nbsp;by Varonis, take aim at the EventLog Remoting Protocol ( MS-EVEN ), which enables remote access to event logs.   While the former allows "any domain user to remotely crash the Event Log application of any Windows machine," OverLog causes a DoS by "filling the hard drive space of any Windows machine on the domain," Dolev Taler&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  OverLog has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-37981 (CVSS score: 4.3) and was addressed by Microsoft as part of its&nbsp; October Patch Tuesday &nbsp;updates. LogCrusher, however, remains unresolved.

Apple Releases Patch for New Actively Exploited iOS and iPadOS Zero-Day Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/apple-releases-patch-for-new-actively.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Tech giant Apple on Monday rolled out updates to remediate a zero-day flaw in iOS and iPadOS that it said has been actively exploited in the wild.  The weakness, given the identifier CVE-2022-42827 , has been described as an out-of-bounds write issue in the Kernel, which could be abused by a rogue application to execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges.  Successful exploitation of out-of-bounds write  flaws, which typically occur when a program attempts to write data to a memory location that's outside of the bounds of what it is allowed to access, can result in corruption of data, a crash, or execution of unauthorized code.  The iPhone maker said it addressed the bug with improved bounds checking, while crediting an anonymous researcher for reporting the vulnerability.  As is usually the case with actively exploited zero-day flaws, Apple refrained from sharing more specifics about the shortcoming other than acknowledging that it's "aware of a report that this i

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-patched vulnerability in VMware Workspace ONE Access has been observed being exploited to deliver both cryptocurrency miners and ransomware on affected machines.  "The attacker intends to utilize a victim's resources as much as possible, not only to install RAR1Ransom for extortion, but also to spread GuardMiner to collect cryptocurrency," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday report.   The issue, tracked as CVE-2022-22954  (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a remote code execution vulnerability that stems from a case of server-side template injection. Although the shortcoming was addressed by the virtualization services provider in April 2022, it has since come under  active  exploitation  in the wild.   Fortinet said it observed in August 2022 attacks that sought to weaponize the flaw to deploy the&nbsp; Mirai botnet &nbsp;on Linux devices as well as the RAR1Ransom and&nbsp; GuardMiner , a variant of the XMRig Monero miner.  The Mirai sample is retrieved fr

Details have emerged about a previously undocumented and fully undetectable (FUD) PowerShell backdoor that gains its stealth by disguising itself as part of a Windows update process.  "The covert self-developed tool and the associated C2 commands seem to be the work of a sophisticated, unknown threat actor who has targeted approximately 100 victims," Tomer Bar, director of security research at SafeBreach,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.  Attributed to an&nbsp; unnamed threat actor , attack chains involving the malware commence with a weaponized&nbsp; Microsoft Word document &nbsp;that, per the company, was uploaded from Jordan on August 25, 2022.   Metadata associated with the lure document indicates that the initial intrusion vector is a LinkedIn-based spear-phishing attack, which ultimately leads to the execution of a PowerShell script via a piece of embedded macro code.   The PowerShell script ( Script1.ps1 ) is designed to connect to a remote command-and-control (C2) server and retrieve a comm

HelpSystems, the company behind the Cobalt Strike software platform, has released an out-of-band security update to address a remote code execution vulnerability that could allow an attacker to take control of targeted systems.  Cobalt Strike is a commercial red-team framework that's mainly used for adversary simulation, but cracked versions of the software have been&nbsp; actively &nbsp; abused &nbsp;by ransomware operators and espionage-focused advanced persistent threat (APT) groups alike.  The&nbsp; post-exploitation tool &nbsp;consists of a team server, which functions as a command-and-control (C2) component, and a beacon, the default malware used to create a connection to the team server and drop next-stage payloads.   The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-42948 , affects Cobalt Strike version 4.7.1, and stems from an incomplete patch released on September 20, 2022, to rectify a cross-site scripting ( XSS ) vulnerability ( CVE-2022-39197 ) that could lead to remote code execution.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has disclosed what's being called a security vulnerability in Microsoft 365 that could be exploited to infer message contents due to the use of a broken cryptographic algorithm.  "The [Office 365 Message Encryption] messages are encrypted in insecure Electronic Codebook ( ECB ) mode of operation," Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.  Office 365 Message Encryption (OME) is a security mechanism used to send and receive encrypted email messages between users inside and outside an organization without revealing anything about the communications themselves.   A consequence of the newly disclosed issue is that rogue third-parties gaining access to the encrypted email messages may be able to decipher the messages, effectively breaking confidentiality protections.  Electronic Codebook is one of the simplest modes of encryption wherein each message block is encoded separately by a key, meaning identical plaintext blocks wi

Zimbra has&nbsp; released patches &nbsp;to contain an actively exploited security flaw in its enterprise collaboration suite that could be leveraged to upload arbitrary files to vulnerable instances.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-41352 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the issue affects a component of the Zimbra suite called&nbsp; Amavis , an open source content filter, and more specifically, the cpio utility it uses to scan and extract archives.   The flaw, in turn, is said to be rooted in another underlying vulnerability ( CVE-2015-1197 ) that was first disclosed in early 2015, which&nbsp; according to Flashpoint &nbsp;was rectified, only to be subsequently reverted in later Linux distributions.  "An attacker can use cpio package to gain incorrect access to any other user accounts," Zimbra said in an advisory published last week, adding it "recommends pax over cpio."

New Timing Attack Against NPM Registry API Could Expose Private Packages<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/new-timing-attack-against-npm-registry.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A novel timing attack discovered against the npm's registry API can be exploited to potentially disclose private packages used by organizations, putting developers at risk of supply chain threats.  "By creating a list of possible package names, threat actors can detect organizations'&nbsp; scoped private packages &nbsp;and then masquerade public packages, tricking employees and users into downloading them," Aqua Security researcher Yakir Kadkoda&nbsp; said .   The Scoped Confusion attack banks on analyzing the time it takes for the&nbsp; npm API &nbsp;(registry.npmjs[.]org) to return an HTTP 404 error message when querying for a private package, and measuring it against the response time for a non-existing module.   "It takes on average less time to get a reply for a private package that does not exist compared to a private package that does," Kadkoda explained.  The idea, ultimately, is to identify packages internally used by companies, which could then be used by threat actors to

Hackers Can Use 'App Mode' in Chromium Browsers' for Stealth Phishing Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/hackers-can-use-app-mode-in-chromium.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's a new phishing technique, it has been demonstrated that the Application Mode feature in Chromium-based web browsers can be abused to create "realistic desktop phishing applications."  Application Mode is designed to offer native-like experiences in a manner that causes the website to be launched in a separate browser window, while also displaying the website's favicon and hiding the address bar.  According to security researcher mr.d0x – who also devised the browser-in-the-browser ( BitB ) attack method earlier this year – a bad actor can leverage this behavior to resort to some HTML/CSS trickery and display a fake address bar on top of the window and fool users into giving up their credentials on rogue login forms.   "Although this technique is meant more towards internal phishing, you can technically still use it in an external phishing scenario," mr.d0x&nbsp; said . "You can deliver these fake applications independently as files."  This is

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have shared details about a now-addressed security flaw in Apple's macOS operating system that could be potentially exploited to run malicious applications in a manner that can bypass Apple's security measures.  The vulnerability, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-32910 , is rooted in the built-in Archive Utility and "could lead to the execution of an unsigned and unnotarized application without displaying security prompts to the user, by using a specially crafted archive," Apple device management firm Jamf  said in an analysis.   Following responsible disclosure on May 31, 2022, Apple addressed the issue as part of&nbsp; macOS Big Sur 11.6.8 &nbsp;and&nbsp; Monterey 12.5 &nbsp;released on July 20, 2022. The tech giant, for its part, also revised the earlier-issued advisories as of October 4 to add an entry for the flaw.

Mitigation for Exchange Zero-Days Bypassed! Microsoft Issues New Workarounds<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/mitigation-for-exchange-zero-days.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has revised its mitigation measures for the newly disclosed and actively exploited zero-day flaws in Exchange Server after it was found that they could be trivially bypassed.  The two vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082, have been codenamed&nbsp; ProxyNotShell &nbsp;due to similarities to another set of flaws called&nbsp; ProxyShell , which the tech giant resolved last year.  In-the-wild attacks abusing the&nbsp; shortcomings &nbsp;have chained the two flaws to gain remote code execution on compromised servers with elevated privileges, leading to the deployment of web shells.  The Windows maker, which is yet to release a fix for the bugs, has acknowledged that a single state-sponsored threat actor may have been weaponizing the flaws since August 2022 in limited targeted attacks.   In the meantime, the company has made available temporary workarounds to reduce the risk of exploitation by restricting known attack patterns through a rule in the IIS Manager.  However, according

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed details about a now-patched high-severity security flaw in Packagist, a PHP software package repository, that could have been exploited to mount software supply chain attacks.  "This vulnerability allows gaining control of&nbsp; Packagist ," SonarSource researcher Thomas Chauchefoin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. Packagist is used by the PHP package manager Composer to determine and download software dependencies that are included by developers in their projects.  The disclosure comes as planting malware in open source repositories is turning into an attractive conduit for mounting&nbsp; software supply chain attacks .   Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-24828 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), the&nbsp; issue &nbsp;has been described as a case of command injection and is linked to another similar Composer bug ( CVE-2021-29472 ) that came to light in April 2021, suggesting an inadequate patch.

The North Korea-backed Lazarus Group has been observed deploying a Windows rootkit by taking advantage of an exploit in a Dell firmware driver, highlighting new tactics adopted by the state-sponsored adversary.  The Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver ( BYOVD ) attack, which took place in the autumn of 2021, is another variant of the threat actor's espionage-oriented activity called Operation In(ter)ception &nbsp;that's directed against aerospace and defense industries.  "The campaign started with spear-phishing emails containing malicious Amazon-themed documents and targeted an employee of an aerospace company in the Netherlands, and a political journalist in Belgium," ESET researcher Peter Kálnai&nbsp; said .   Attack chains unfolded upon the opening of the lure documents, leading to the distribution of malicious droppers that were trojanized versions of open source projects, corroborating recent reports from Google's&nbsp; Mandiant &nbsp;and&nbsp; Microsoft .

Microsoft officially disclosed it investigating two zero-day security vulnerabilities impacting Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and 2019 following&nbsp; reports of in-the-wild exploitation .  "The first vulnerability, identified as&nbsp; CVE-2022-41040 , is a Server-Side Request Forgery ( SSRF ) vulnerability, while the second, identified as&nbsp; CVE-2022-41082 , allows remote code execution (RCE) when PowerShell is accessible to the attacker," the tech giant&nbsp; said .  The company also confirmed that it's aware of "limited targeted attacks" weaponizing the flaws to obtain initial access to targeted systems, but emphasized that authenticated access to the vulnerable Exchange Server is required to achieve successful exploitation.  The attacks detailed by Microsoft show that the two flaws are stringed together in an exploit chain, with the SSRF bug enabling an authenticated adversary to remotely trigger arbitrary code execution.

WhatsApp has released&nbsp; security updates &nbsp;to address two flaws in its messaging app for Android and iOS that could lead to remote code execution on vulnerable devices.  One of them concerns&nbsp; CVE-2022-36934 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), a critical integer overflow vulnerability in WhatsApp that results in the execution of arbitrary code simply by establishing a video call.  The issue impacts the WhatsApp and WhatsApp Business for Android and iOS prior to versions 2.22.16.12.   Also patched by the Meta-owned messaging platform is an integer underflow bug, which refers to an opposite category of errors that occur when the result of an operation is too small for storing the value within the allocated memory space.  The high-severity issue, given the CVE identifier&nbsp; CVE-2022-27492 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), affects WhatsApp for Android prior to versions 2.22.16.2 and WhatsApp for iOS version 2.22.15.9, and could be triggered upon receiving a specially crafted video file.

Security software company Sophos has warned of cyberattacks targeting a recently addressed critical vulnerability in its firewall product.  The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-3236 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), impacts Sophos Firewall v19.0 MR1 (19.0.1) and older and concerns a code injection vulnerability in the User Portal and Webadmin components that could result in remote code execution.  The company&nbsp; said &nbsp;it "has observed this vulnerability being used to target a small set of specific organizations, primarily in the South Asia region," adding it directly notified these entities.   As a workaround, Sophos is recommending that users take steps to ensure that the User Portal and Webadmin are not exposed to WAN. Alternatively, users can update to the latest supported version -   v19.5 GA  v19.0 MR2 (19.0.2)  v19.0 GA, MR1, and MR1-1  v18.5 MR5 (18.5.5)  v18.5 GA, MR1, MR1-1, MR2, MR3, and MR4  v18.0 MR3, MR4, MR5, and MR6  v17.5 MR12, MR13, MR14, MR15, MR16, and MR17  v17.0 MR10   Users

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed a new severe Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) vulnerability that could be exploited by users to access the virtual disks of other Oracle customers.  "Each virtual disk in Oracle's cloud has a unique identifier called OCID," Shir Tamari, head of research at Wiz,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets. "This identifier is not considered secret, and organizations do not treat it as such."  "Given the OCID of a victim's disk that is not currently attached to an active server or configured as shareable, an attacker could 'attach' to it and obtain read/write over it," Tamari added.   The cloud security firm, which dubbed the tenant isolation vulnerability " AttachMe ," said Oracle&nbsp; patched the issue &nbsp;within 24 hours of responsible disclosure on June 9, 2022.  Accessing a volume using the CLI without sufficient permissions  At its core, the vulnerability is rooted in the fact that a disk could be attached to a compute

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as 350,000 open source projects are believed to be potentially vulnerable to exploitation as a result of a security flaw in a Python module that has remained unpatched for 15 years.  The open source repositories span a number of industry verticals, such as software development, artificial intelligence/machine learning, web development, media, security, IT management.  The shortcoming, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2007-4559 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.8), is rooted in the tarfile module, successful exploitation of which could lead to code execution from an arbitrary file write.   "The vulnerability is a path traversal attack in the extract and extractall functions in the tarfile module that allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files by adding the '..' sequence to filenames in a TAR archive," Trellix security researcher Kasimir Schulz&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a writeup.  Originally disclosed in August 2007, the bug has to do with how a specially crafted tar archive can be leveraged to overwrite a

Over 39,000 Unauthenticated Redis Instances Found Exposed on the Internet<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/over-39000-unauthenticated-redis.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown attacker targeted tens of thousands of unauthenticated Redis servers exposed on the internet in an attempt to&nbsp; install a cryptocurrency miner .  It's not immediately known if all of these hosts were successfully compromised. Nonetheless, it was made possible by means of a "lesser-known technique" designed to trick the servers into writing data to arbitrary files – a case of&nbsp; unauthorized access &nbsp;that was first documented in September 2018.  "The general idea behind this exploitation technique is to configure Redis to write its file-based database to a directory containing some method to authorize a user (like adding a key to '.ssh/authorized_keys'), or start a process (like adding a script to '/etc/cron.d')," Censys&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new write-up.   The attack surface management platform said it uncovered evidence (i.e., Redis commands) indicating efforts on part of the attacker to store malicious&nbsp; crontab entries &nbsp;into the file "/var/

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday released an industrial control systems (ICS) advisory warning of seven security flaws in Dataprobe's iBoot-PDU power distribution unit product, mostly used in&nbsp;industrial environments and data centers.  "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution on the Dataprobe iBoot-PDU device," the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a notice.  Credited with disclosing the flaws is industrial cybersecurity firm Claroty, which&nbsp; said &nbsp;the weaknesses could be remotely triggered "either through a direct web connection to the device or via the cloud."   iBoot-PDU &nbsp;is a power distribution unit (PDU) that provides users with real-time monitoring capabilities and sophisticated alerting mechanisms via a web interface so as to control the power supply to devices and other equipment in an OT environment.

Over 280,000 WordPress Sites Attacked Using WPGateway Plugin Zero-Day Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/over-280000-wordpress-sites-attacked.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A zero-day flaw in the latest version of a WordPress premium plugin known as&nbsp; WPGateway &nbsp;is being actively exploited in the wild, potentially allowing malicious actors to completely take over affected sites.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-3180 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the issue is being weaponized to add a malicious administrator user to sites running the WPGateway plugin, WordPress security company Wordfence noted.  "Part of the plugin functionality exposes a vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attackers to insert a malicious administrator," Wordfence researcher Ram Gall&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory.   WPGateway is billed as a means for site administrators to install, backup, and clone WordPress plugins and themes from a unified dashboard.  The most common indicator that a website running the plugin has been compromised is the presence of an administrator with the username "rangex."  Additionally, the appearance of requests to "//wp-content/plugins/wpgateway/wpgateway-webse

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple has released another round of security updates to address multiple vulnerabilities in iOS and macOS, including a new zero-day flaw that has been used in attacks in the wild.  The issue, assigned the identifier&nbsp; CVE-2022-32917 , is rooted in the Kernel component and could enable a malicious app to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.  "Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited," the iPhone maker acknowledged in a brief statement, adding it resolved the bug with improved bound checks.  An anonymous researcher has been credited with reporting the shortcoming. It's worth noting that CVE-2022-32917 is also the&nbsp; second Kernel related zero-day flaw &nbsp;that Apple has remediated in less than a month.   Patches are available in versions&nbsp; iOS 15.7, iPadOS 15.7 ,&nbsp; iOS 16 ,&nbsp; macOS Big Sur 11.7 , and&nbsp; macOS Monterey 12.6 .

High-Severity Firmware Security Flaws Left Unpatched in HP Enterprise Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/high-severity-firmware-security-flaws.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A number of firmware security flaws uncovered in HP's business-oriented high-end notebooks continue to be left unpatched in some devices even months after public disclosure.  Binarly, which first&nbsp; revealed details &nbsp;of the issues at the&nbsp; Black Hat USA conference &nbsp;in mid-August 2022, said the vulnerabilities "can't be detected by firmware integrity monitoring systems due to limitations of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) measurement."  Firmware flaws can have serious implications as they can be abused by an adversary to achieve long-term persistence on a device in a manner that can survive reboots and evade traditional operating system-level security protections.   The high-severity weaknesses identified by Binarly affect HP EliteBook devices and concern a case of memory corruption in the System Management Mode (SMM) of the firmware, thereby enabling the execution of arbitrary code with the highest privileges -   CVE-2022-23930 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.2) - Stack-based buffer

Cisco on Wednesday rolled out patches to address&nbsp; three security flaws &nbsp;affecting its products, including a high-severity weakness disclosed in NVIDIA Data Plane Development Kit (MLNX_DPDK) late last month.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-28199 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.6), the vulnerability stems from a lack of proper error handling in DPDK's network stack, enabling a remote adversary to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition and cause an impact on data integrity and confidentiality.  "If an error condition is observed on the device interface, the device may either reload or fail to receive traffic, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition," Cisco&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a notice published on September 7.   DPDK &nbsp;refers to a set of libraries and optimized network interface card (NIC) drivers for fast packet processing, offering a framework and common API for high-speed networking applications.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Networking equipment maker Zyxel has released patches for a critical security flaw impacting its network-attached storage (NAS) devices.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-34747 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the issue relates to a "format string vulnerability" affecting NAS326, NAS540, and NAS542 models. Zyxel credited researcher Shaposhnikov Ilya for reporting the flaw.  "A format string vulnerability was found in a specific binary of Zyxel NAS products that could allow an attacker to achieve unauthorized remote code execution via a crafted UDP packet," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory released on September 6.   The flaw affects the following versions -   NAS326 (V5.21(AAZF.11)C0 and earlier)  NAS540 (V5.21(AATB.8)C0 and earlier), and  NAS542 (V5.21(ABAG.8)C0 and earlier)   The disclosure comes as Zyxel previously addressed local privilege escalation and authenticated directory traversal vulnerabilities ( CVE-2022-30526 and CVE-2022-2030 ) affecting its firewall products in July.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Friday shipped emergency fixes to address a security vulnerability in the Chrome web browser that it said is being actively exploited in the wild.  The issue, assigned the identifier&nbsp; CVE-2022-3075 , concerns a case of insufficient data validating in&nbsp; Mojo , which refers to a collection of runtime libraries that provide a platform-agnostic mechanism for inter-process communication (IPC).  An anonymous researcher has been credited with reporting the high-severity flaw on August 30, 2022.  "Google is aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2022-3075 exists in the wild," the internet giant&nbsp; said , without delving into additional specifics about the nature of the attacks to prevent additional threat actors from taking advantage of the flaw.   The latest update makes it the sixth zero-day vulnerability in Chrome that Google has resolved since the start of the year -   CVE-2022-0609 &nbsp;- Use-after-free in Animation  CVE-2022-1096 &nbsp;- Type confusion in V8  CVE-2022-1364 &nbsp;-

Warning: PyPI Feature Executes Code Automatically After Python Package Download<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/warning-pypi-feature-executes-code.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In another finding that could expose developers to increased risk of a supply chain attack, it has emerged that nearly one-third of the packages in PyPI, the Python Package Index, trigger automatic code execution upon downloading them.  "A worrying feature in pip/PyPI allows code to automatically run when developers are merely downloading a package," Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published this week.  "Also, this feature is alarming due to the fact that a great deal of the malicious packages we are finding in the wild use this feature of code execution upon installation to achieve higher infection rates."  One of the ways by which packages can be installed for Python is by executing the " pip install " command, which, in turn, invokes a file called "setup.py" that comes bundled along with the module.   "setup.py," as the name implies, is a&nbsp; setup script &nbsp;that's used to specify metadata associated wit

Microsoft Discover Severe 'One-Click' Exploit for TikTok Android App<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/microsoft-discover-severe-one-click.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Wednesday disclosed details of a now-patched "high severity vulnerability" in the TikTok app for Android that could let attackers take over accounts when victims clicked on a malicious link.  "Attackers could have leveraged the vulnerability to hijack an account without users' awareness if a targeted user simply clicked a specially crafted link," Dimitrios Valsamaras of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up.  Successful exploitation of the flaw could have permitted malicious actors to access and modify users' TikTok profiles and sensitive information, leading to the unauthorized exposure of private videos. Attackers could also have abused the bug to send messages and upload videos on behalf of users.   The issue, addressed in version 23.7.3, impacts two flavors of its Android app com.ss.android.ugc.trill (for East and Southeast Asian users) and com.zhiliaoapp.musically (for users in other countries except for India, wher

Apple on Wednesday backported security updates to older iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch devices to address a&nbsp; critical security flaw &nbsp;that has been actively exploited in the wild.  The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-32893 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), is an out-of-bounds write issue affecting WebKit that could lead to arbitrary code execution when processing maliciously crafted web content.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security researcher who has a long line of work demonstrating novel data exfiltration methods from air-gapped systems has come up with yet another technique that involves sending Morse code signals via LEDs on network interface cards ( NICs ).  The approach, codenamed&nbsp; ETHERLED , comes from Dr. Mordechai Guri , the head of R&amp;D in the Cyber Security Research Center in the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, who recently outlined&nbsp; GAIROSCOPE , a method for transmitting data ultrasonically to smartphone gyroscopes.   "Malware installed on the device could programmatically control the status LED by blinking or alternating its colors, using documented methods or undocumented firmware commands," Dr. Guri said.  "Information can be encoded via simple encoding such as Morse code and modulated over these optical signals. An attacker can intercept and decode these signals from tens to hundreds of meters away."   A network interface card, also known as a netwo

DevOps platform GitLab this week issued patches to address a critical security flaw in its software that could lead to arbitrary code execution on affected systems.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-2884 , the issue is rated 9.9 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system and impacts all versions of GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE) starting from 11.3.4 before 15.1.5, 15.2 before 15.2.3, and 15.3 before 15.3.1.  At its core, the security weakness is a case of authenticated remote code execution that can be triggered via the GitHub import API. GitLab credited&nbsp; yvvdwf &nbsp;with discovering and reporting the flaw.   While the issue has been resolved in versions 15.3.1, 15.2.3, 15.1.5, users also have the option of securing against the flaw by temporarily disabling the GitHub import option -   Click "Menu" -&gt; "Admin"  Click "Settings" -&gt; "General"  Expand the "Visibility and access controls" tab  Under "Import sources"

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details of an eight-year-old security vulnerability in the Linux kernel have emerged that the researchers say is "as nasty as Dirty Pipe."  Dubbed&nbsp; DirtyCred &nbsp;by a group of academics from Northwestern University, the security weakness exploits a previously unknown flaw ( CVE-2022-2588 ) to escalate privileges to the maximum level.  "DirtyCred is a kernel exploitation concept that swaps unprivileged&nbsp; kernel credentials &nbsp;with privileged ones to escalate privilege," researchers Zhenpeng Lin, Yuhang Wu, and Xinyu Xing noted. "Instead of overwriting any critical data fields on kernel heap, DirtyCred abuses the heap memory reuse mechanism to get privileged."   This entails three steps -   Free an in-use unprivileged credential with the vulnerability  Allocate privileged credentials in the freed memory slot by triggering a privileged userspace process such as su, mount, or sshd  Operate as a privileged user   The novel exploitation method, according to the resea

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed multiple vulnerabilities impacting Ultra-wideband (UWB) Real-time Locating Systems ( RTLS ), enabling threat actors to launch adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks and tamper with location data.  "The zero-days found specifically pose a security risk for workers in industrial environments," cybersecurity firm Nozomi Networks&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a technical write-up last week. "If a threat actor exploits these vulnerabilities, they have the ability to tamper with safety zones designated by RTLS to protect workers in hazardous areas."   RTLS is used to automatically identify and track the location of objects or people in real-time, usually within a confined indoor area. This is achieved by making use of tags that are attached to assets, which broadcast USB signals to fixed reference points called anchors that then determine their location.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple on Wednesday released security updates for&nbsp; iOS, iPadOS , and&nbsp; macOS &nbsp;platforms to remediate two zero-day vulnerabilities previously exploited by threat actors to compromise its devices.  The list of issues is below -   CVE-2022-32893 &nbsp;- An out-of-bounds issue in WebKit which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code by processing a specially crafted web content  CVE-2022-32894 &nbsp;- An out-of-bounds issue in the operating system's Kernel that could be abused by a malicious application to execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges   Apple said it addressed both the issues with improved bounds checking, adding it's aware the vulnerabilities "may have been actively exploited."  The company did not disclose any additional information regarding these attacks or the identities of the threat actors perpetrating them, although it's likely that they were abused as part of highly-targeted intrusions.   The latest update brings the total number of zero-days

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday rolled out patches for Chrome browser for desktops to contain an actively exploited high-severity zero-day flaw in the wild.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-2856 , the issue has been described as a case of insufficient validation of untrusted input in&nbsp; Intents . Security researchers Ashley Shen and Christian Resell of Google Threat Analysis Group have been credited with reporting the flaw on July 19, 2022.  As is typically the case, the tech giant has refrained from sharing additional specifics about the shortcoming until a majority of the users are updated. "Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2022-2856 exists in the wild," it&nbsp; acknowledged &nbsp;in a terse statement.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of researchers has revealed details of a new vulnerability affecting Intel CPUs that enables attackers to obtain encryption keys and other secret information from the processors.  Dubbed&nbsp; ÆPIC Leak , the weakness is the first-of-its-kind to architecturally disclose sensitive data in a manner that's akin to an "uninitialized memory read in the CPU itself."  "In contrast to transient execution attacks like&nbsp; Meltdown and Spectre ,&nbsp; ÆPIC Leak &nbsp;is an architectural bug: the sensitive data gets directly disclosed without relying on any (noisy) side channel," the academics said.  The study was conducted by researchers from the Sapienza University of Rome, the Graz University of Technology, Amazon Web Services, and the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security.  The vulnerability ( CVE-2022-21233 , CVSS score: 6.0), which affects CPUs with Sunny Cover microarchitecture, is rooted in a component called Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller ( APIC ), wh

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security flaws have been identified in Xiaomi Redmi Note 9T and Redmi Note 11 models, which could be exploited to disable the mobile payment mechanism and even forge transactions via a rogue Android app installed on the devices.  Check Point said it found the flaws in devices powered by MediaTek chipsets during a security analysis of the Chinese handset maker's "Kinibi" Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).  A TEE refers to a&nbsp; secure enclave &nbsp;inside the main processor that's used to process and store sensitive information such as cryptographic keys so as to ensure confidentiality and integrity.   Specifically, the Israeli cybersecurity firm discovered that a trusted app on a Xiaomi device can be downgraded due to a lack of version control, enabling an attacker to replace a newer, secure version of an app with an older, vulnerable variant.  "Therefore, an attacker can bypass security fixes made by Xiaomi or MediaTek in trusted apps by downgrading them to unpatched

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed multiple severe security vulnerabilities asset management platform&nbsp; Device42 &nbsp;that, if successfully exploited, could enable a malicious actor to seize control of affected systems.  "By exploiting these issues, an attacker could impersonate other users, obtain admin-level access in the application (by leaking session with an&nbsp; LFI ) or obtain full access to the appliance files and database (through remote code execution)," Bitdefender&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report.   Even more concerningly, an adversary with any level of access within the host network could daisy-chain three of the flaws to bypass authentication protections and achieve remote code execution with the highest privileges.   The issues in question are listed below -   CVE-2022-1399 &nbsp;- Remote Code Execution in scheduled tasks component  CVE-2022-1400 &nbsp;- Hard-coded encryption key IV in Exago WebReportsApi.dll  CVE 2022-1401 &nbsp;- Insufficient validation of provided paths in Exago

As many as&nbsp; 121 new security flaws &nbsp;were patched by Microsoft as part of its Patch Tuesday updates for the month of August, which also includes a fix for a Support Diagnostic Tool vulnerability that the company said is being actively exploited in the wild.  Of the 121 bugs, 17 are rated Critical, 102 are rated Important, one is rated Moderate, and one is rated Low in severity. Two of the issues have been listed as publicly known at the time of the release.  It's worth noting that the 121 security flaws are in addition to&nbsp; 25 shortcomings &nbsp;the tech giant addressed in its Chromium-based Edge browser late last month and the previous week.  Topping the list of patches is&nbsp; CVE-2022-34713 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), a case of remote code execution affecting the Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), making it the second flaw in the same component after&nbsp; Follina &nbsp;(CVE-2022-30190) to be weaponized in&nbsp; real-world attacks &nbsp;within three months.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has warned of critical security vulnerabilities in Emergency Alert System (EAS) encoder/decoder devices.  If left unpatched, the issues could allow an adversary to issue fraudulent emergency alerts over TV, radio, and cable networks.  The August 1 advisory comes courtesy of DHS' Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). CYBIR security researcher Ken Pyle has been credited with discovering the shortcoming.   EAS is a U.S. national&nbsp; public warning system &nbsp;that enables state authorities to disseminate information within 10 minutes during an emergency. Such alerts can interrupt radio and television to broadcast emergency alert information.   Details of the flaw have been kept under wraps to prevent active exploitation by malicious actors, although it's expected to be publicized as a proof-of-concept at the DEF CON conference to be held in Las Vegas next week.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as 29 different router models from DrayTek have been identified as affected by a new critical, unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability that, if successfully exploited, could lead to full compromise of the devices and unauthorized access to the broader network.  "The attack can be performed without user interaction if the management interface of the device has been configured to be internet facing," Trellix researcher Philippe Laulheret&nbsp; said . "A one-click attack can also be performed from within the LAN in the default device configuration."  Filed under CVE-2022-32548, the vulnerability has received the maximum severity rating of 10.0 on the CVSS scoring system, owing to its ability to completely allow an adversary to seize control of the routers.   At its core, the shortcoming is the result of a buffer overflow flaw in the web management interface ("/cgi-bin/wlogin.cgi"), which can be weaponized by a malicious actor by supplying spec

Cisco Business Routers Found Vulnerable to Critical Remote Hacking Flaws<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/cisco-business-routers-found-vulnerable.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco on Wednesday rolled out patches to address eight security vulnerabilities , three of which could be weaponized by an unauthenticated attacker to gain remote code execution (RCE) or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on affected devices.  The most critical of the flaws impact Cisco Small Business RV160, RV260, RV340, and RV345 Series routers. Tracked as CVE-2022-20842 (CVSS score: 9.8), the weakness stems from an insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface of the appliances.   "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device," Cisco said  in an advisory. "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition."  A second shortcoming relates to a command injection vulnerability residing in the routers' web filter database update featur

Virtualization services provider VMware on Tuesday shipped updates to&nbsp; address 10 security flaws &nbsp;affecting multiple products that could be abused by unauthenticated attackers to perform malicious actions.  The issues, tracked from CVE-2022-31656 through CVE-2022-31665 (CVSS scores: 4.7 - 9.8), impact VMware Workspace ONE Access, Workspace ONE Access Connector, Identity Manager, Identity Manager Connector, vRealize Automation, Cloud Foundation, and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager.   The most severe of the flaws is CVE-2022-31656 (CVSS score: 9.8), an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting local domain users that could be leveraged by a bad actor with network access to obtain administrative rights.  Also resolved by VMware are three remote code execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-31658, CVE-2022-31659, and CVE-2022-31665) related to JDBC and SQL injection that could be weaponized by an adversary with administrator and network access.

New 'ParseThru' Parameter Smuggling Vulnerability Affects Golang-based Applications<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/new-parsethru-parameter-smuggling.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have discovered a new vulnerability called&nbsp; ParseThru &nbsp;affecting Golang-based applications that could be abused to gain unauthorized access to cloud-based applications.  "The newly discovered vulnerability allows a threat actor to bypass validations under certain conditions, as a result of the use of unsafe URL parsing methods built in the language," Israeli cybersecurity firm Oxeye said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.  The issue, at its core, has to do with inconsistencies stemming from changes introduced to Golang's URL parsing logic that's implemented in the "net/url" library.   While versions of the programming language prior to 1.17 treated semicolons as a valid query delimiter (e.g., example.com?a=1;b=2&amp;c=3), this behavior has since been modified to throw an error upon finding a query string containing a semicolon.   "The net/url and net/http packages used to accept ";" (semicolon) as a setting separat

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A week after Atlassian rolled out patches to contain a critical flaw in its Questions For Confluence app for Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center, the shortcoming has now come under active exploitation in the wild.  The bug in question is&nbsp; CVE-2022-26138 , which concerns the use of a hard-coded password in the app that could be exploited by a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain unrestricted access to all pages in Confluence.   The real-world exploitation follows the release of the hard-coded credentials on Twitter, prompting the Australian software company to prioritize patches to mitigate potential threats targeting the flaw.  "Unsurprisingly, it didn't take long [...] to observe exploitation once the hard-coded credentials were released, given the high value of Confluence for attackers who often jump on Confluence vulnerabilities to execute ransomware attacks," Rapid7 security researcher Glenn Thorpe&nbsp; said .

The team behind LibreOffice has released security updates to fix three security flaws in the productivity software, one of which could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on affected systems.

"An adversary could therefore create an arbitrary certificate with a serial number and an issuer string identical to a trusted certificate which LibreOffice would present as belonging to the trusted author, potentially leading to the user to execute arbitrary code contained in macros improperly trusted," LibreOffice said in an advisory.

FileWave's mobile device management (MDM) system has been found vulnerable to two critical security flaws that could be leveraged to carry out remote attacks and seize control of a fleet of devices connected to it.  "The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable and enable an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain full control over the MDM platform and its managed devices," Claroty security researcher Noam Moshe&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday report.  FileWave MDM is a cross-platform mobile device management solution that allows IT administrators to manage and monitor all of an organization's devices, including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, workstations, and smart TVs.  The platform functions as a channel to push mandatory software and updates, change device settings, and even remotely wipe devices, all of which is delivered from a central server.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Network security company SonicWall on Friday rolled out fixes to mitigate a critical SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability affecting its Analytics On-Prem and Global Management System (GMS) products.  The vulnerability, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-22280 , is rated 9.4 for severity on the CVSS scoring system and stems from what the company describes is an "improper neutralization of special elements" used in an SQL command that could lead to an unauthenticated SQL injection.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Atlassian has rolled out fixes to remediate a critical security vulnerability pertaining to the use of hard-coded credentials affecting&nbsp; the Questions For Confluence &nbsp;app for Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center.  The flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-26138 , arises when the app in question is enabled on either of two services, causing it to create a Confluence user account with the username "disabledsystemuser."  While this account, Atlassian says, is to help administrators migrate data from the app to Confluence Cloud, it's also created with a hard-coded password, effectively allowing viewing and editing all non-restricted pages within Confluence by default.   "A remote, unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded password could exploit this to log into Confluence and access any pages the&nbsp; confluence-users group &nbsp;has access to," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory, adding that "the hard-coded password is trivial to obtain after downloading an

Security Experts Warn of Two Primary Client-Side Risks Associated with Data Exfiltration and Loss<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/security-experts-warn-of-two-primary.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two client-side risks dominate the problems with data loss and data exfiltration: improperly placed trackers on websites and web applications and malicious client-side code pulled from third-party repositories like NPM.&nbsp;  Client-side security researchers are finding that improperly placed trackers, while not intentionally malicious, are a growing problem and have clear and significant privacy implications when it comes to both compliance/regulatory concerns, like HIPAA or PCI DSS 4.0. To highlight the risks with misplaced trackers, a&nbsp; recent study &nbsp;by The Markup (a non-profit news organization) examined Newsweek's top 100 hospitals in America. They found a Facebook tracker on one-third of the hospital websites which sent Facebook highly personal healthcare data whenever the user clicked the "schedule appointment" button. The data was not necessarily anonymized, because the data was connected to an IP address, and both the IP address and the appointment information get delivered to Fac

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers from Wordfence have&nbsp; sounded &nbsp;the alarm about a "sudden" spike in cyber attacks attempting to exploit an unpatched flaw in a WordPress plugin called&nbsp; Kaswara Modern WPBakery Page Builder Addons .  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-24284 , the issue is rated 10.0 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system and relates to an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload that could be abused to gain code execution, permitting attackers to seize control of affected WordPress sites.   Although the bug was originally&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in April 2021 by the WordPress security company, it continues to remain unresolved to date. To make matters worse, the plugin has been closed and is no longer actively maintained.  Wordfence, which is protecting over 1,000 websites that have the plugin installed, said it has blocked an average of 443,868 attack attempts per day since the start of the month.   The attacks have emanated from 10,215 IP addresses, with a majority of the exploitation attempts narrowed down

Microsoft Details App Sandbox Escape Bug Impacting Apple iOS, iPadOS, macOS Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/microsoft-details-app-sandbox-escape.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Wednesday shed light on a now patched security vulnerability affecting Apple's operating systems that, if successfully exploited, could allow attackers to escalate device privileges and deploy malware.  "An attacker could take advantage of this sandbox escape vulnerability to gain elevated privileges on the affected device or execute malicious commands like installing additional payloads," Jonathan Bar Or of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-26706 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 5.5), the security vulnerability impacts iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS and was fixed by Apple in May 2022.   Calling it an access issue affecting the LaunchServices (launchd) component, the tech giant noted that "A sandboxed process may be able to circumvent sandbox restrictions," adding it mitigates the issue with additional restrictions.  While Apple's&nbsp; App Sandbox &nbsp;is designed to tightly regulate a third-party app's access

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Consumer electronics maker Lenovo on Tuesday&nbsp; rolled out fixes &nbsp;to contain three security flaws in its UEFI firmware affecting over 70 product models.  "The vulnerabilities can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution in the early phases of the platform boot, possibly allowing the attackers to hijack the OS execution flow and disable some important security features," Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets.   Tracked as CVE-2022-1890, CVE-2022-1891, and CVE-2022-1892, all three bugs relate to&nbsp; buffer overflow vulnerabilities &nbsp;that have been described by Lenovo as leading to privilege escalation on affected systems. Martin Smolár from ESET has been credited with reporting the flaws.   The bugs stem from an insufficient validation of an NVRAM variable called "DataSize" in three different drivers ReadyBootDxe, SystemLoadDefaultDxe, and SystemBootManagerDxe, leading to a buffer overflow that could be weaponized to achieve code execution.

Cisco on Wednesday rolled out patches for&nbsp; 10 security flaws &nbsp;spanning multiple products, one of which is rated Critical in severity and could be weaponized to conduct absolute path traversal attacks.

CVE-2022-20812 (CVSS score: 9.0), which concerns a case of arbitrary file overwrite in the cluster database API, requires the authenticated, remote attacker to have Administrator read-write privileges on the application so as to be able to mount path traversal attacks as a root user.

The maintainers of the OpenSSL project have released patches to address a&nbsp; high-severity bug &nbsp;in the cryptographic library that could potentially lead to remote code execution under certain scenarios.  The&nbsp; issue , now assigned the identifier&nbsp; CVE-2022-2274 , has been described as a case of heap memory corruption with RSA private key operation that was introduced in OpenSSL version 3.0.4 released on June 21, 2022.  First released in 1998, OpenSSL is a general-purpose&nbsp; cryptography library &nbsp;that offers open-source implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, enabling users to generate private keys, create certificate signing requests ( CSRs ), install SSL/TLS certificates.

Update Google Chrome Browser to Patch New Zero-Day Exploit Detected in the Wild<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/update-google-chrome-browser-to-patch.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Monday shipped security updates to address a high-severity zero-day vulnerability in its Chrome web browser that it said is being exploited in the wild.  The shortcoming, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-2294 , relates to a heap overflow flaw in the&nbsp; WebRTC &nbsp;component that provides real-time audio and video communication capabilities in browsers without the need to install plugins or download native apps.  Heap buffer overflows, also referred to as heap overrun or heap smashing, occur when data is overwritten in the&nbsp; heap area of the memory , leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.   "Heap-based overflows can be used to overwrite function pointers that may be living in memory, pointing it to the attacker's code," MITRE&nbsp; explains . "When the consequence is arbitrary code execution, this can often be used to subvert any other security service."  Credited with reporting the flaw on July 1, 2022, is Jan Vojtesek from the Avast Thre

Amazon Quietly Patches 'High Severity' Vulnerability in Android Photos App<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/amazon-quietly-patches-high-severity.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Amazon, in December 2021, patched a high severity vulnerability affecting its&nbsp; Photos app &nbsp;for Android that could have been exploited to steal a user's access tokens.  "The Amazon access token is used to authenticate the user across multiple Amazon APIs, some of which contain personal data such as full name, email, and address," Checkmarx researchers João Morais and Pedro Umbelino&nbsp; said . "Others, like the Amazon Drive API, allow an attacker full access to the user's files."   The Israeli application security testing company reported the issue to Amazon on November 7, 2021, following which the tech giant rolled out a fix on December 18, 2021.  The leak is the result of a misconfiguration in one of the app's components named "com.amazon.gallery.thor.app.activity.ThorViewActivity" that's defined in the&nbsp; AndroidManifest.xml file &nbsp;and which, when launched, initiates an HTTP request with a header containing the access token.   In a nutshell, it

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new security vulnerability has been disclosed in RARlab's UnRAR utility that, if successfully exploited, could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a system that relies on the binary.  The flaw, assigned the identifier CVE-2022-30333, relates to a path traversal vulnerability in the Unix versions of UnRAR that can be triggered upon extracting a maliciously crafted RAR archive.  Following responsible disclosure on May 4, 2022, the shortcoming was addressed by RarLab as part of&nbsp; version 6.12 &nbsp;released on May 6. Other versions of the software, including those for Windows and Android operating systems, are not impacted.   "An attacker is able to create files outside of the target extraction directory when an application or victim user extracts an untrusted archive," SonarSource researcher Simon Scannell&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. "If they can write to a known location, they are likely to be able to leverage it in a way leading to the execution of arb

Cybersecurity researchers from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;details of a new security flaw affecting Microsoft's Service Fabric that could be exploited to obtain elevated permissions and seize control of all nodes in a cluster.  The issue, which has been dubbed&nbsp; FabricScape &nbsp;( CVE-2022-30137 ), could be exploited on containers that are configured to have&nbsp; runtime access . It has been&nbsp; remediated &nbsp;as of June 14, 2022, in&nbsp; Service Fabric 9.0 Cumulative Update 1.0 .   Azure Service Fabric &nbsp;is Microsoft's platform-as-a-service ( PaaS ) and a container orchestrator solution used to build and deploy microservices-based cloud applications across a cluster of machines. "The vulnerability enables a bad actor, with access to a compromised container, to escalate privileges and gain control of the resource's host SF node and the entire cluster," Microsoft&nbsp; said &nbsp;as part of the coordinated disclosure process.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The latest version of the OpenSSL library has been discovered as susceptible to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability on select systems.  The issue has been identified in OpenSSL&nbsp; version 3.0.4 , which was released on June 21, 2022, and impacts x64 systems with the&nbsp; AVX-512 &nbsp;instruction set. OpenSSL 1.1.1 as well as OpenSSL forks BoringSSL and LibreSSL are not affected.   Security researcher Guido Vranken, who reported the bug at the end of May,&nbsp; said &nbsp;it "can be triggered trivially by an attacker." Although the shortcoming has been&nbsp; fixed , no patches have been made available as yet.  OpenSSL is a popular cryptography library that offers an open source implementation of the Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) protocol. Advanced Vector Extensions ( AVX ) are extensions to the x86 instruction set architecture for microprocessors from Intel and AMD.  "I do not think this is a security vulnerability," Tomáš Mráz of the OpenSSL Foundation said in a GitHub issue thread.

QNAP, Taiwanese maker of network-attached storage (NAS) devices, on Wednesday said it's in the process of fixing a critical three-year-old PHP vulnerability that could be abused to achieve remote code execution.  "A vulnerability has been reported to affect PHP versions 7.1.x below 7.1.33, 7.2.x below 7.2.24, and 7.3.x below 7.3.11 with improper nginx config," the hardware vendor&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "If exploited, the vulnerability allows attackers to gain remote code execution."   The vulnerability, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2019-11043 , is rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system. That said, it's required that Nginx and php-fpm are running in appliances using the following QNAP operating system versions -   QTS 5.0.x and later  QTS 4.5.x and later  QuTS hero h5.0.x and later  QuTS hero h4.5.x and later  QuTScloud c5.0.x and later   "As QTS, QuTS hero or QuTScloud does not have nginx installed by default, QNAP NAS are not aff

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new piece of research from academics at ETH Zurich has identified a number of critical security issues in the MEGA cloud storage service that could be leveraged to break the confidentiality and integrity of user data.  In a paper titled " MEGA: Malleable Encryption Goes Awry ," the researchers point out how MEGA's system does not protect its users against a malicious server, thereby enabling a rogue actor to fully compromise the privacy of the uploaded files.  "Additionally, the integrity of user data is damaged to the extent that an attacker can insert malicious files of their choice which pass all authenticity checks of the client," ETH Zurich's Matilda Backendal, Miro Haller, and Kenneth G. Paterson said in an analysis of the service's cryptographic architecture.  MEGA, which&nbsp; advertises &nbsp;itself as the "privacy company" and claims to provide user-controlled end-to-end encrypted cloud storage, has more than 10 million daily active users, w

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security flaw in Apple Safari that was exploited in the wild earlier this year was originally fixed in 2013 and reintroduced in December 2016, according to a new report from Google Project Zero.  The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-22620 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), concerns a case of a use-after-free vulnerability in the WebKit component that could be exploited by a piece of specially crafted web content to gain arbitrary code execution.  In early February 2022, Apple shipped patches for the bug across Safari, iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, while acknowledging that it "may have been actively exploited."   "In this case, the variant was completely patched when the vulnerability was initially reported in 2013," Maddie Stone of Google Project Zero&nbsp; said . "However, the variant was reintroduced three years later during large refactoring efforts. The vulnerability then continued to exist for 5 years until it was fixed as an in-the-wild zero-day in January 2022."  While both th

A recently patched&nbsp; critical security flaw &nbsp;in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center products is being actively weaponized in real-world attacks to drop cryptocurrency miners and ransomware payloads.

WordPress websites using a widely used plugin named Ninja Forms have been updated automatically to remediate a critical security vulnerability that's suspected of having been actively exploited in the wild.  The issue, which relates to a case of code injection, is rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity and affects multiple versions starting from 3.0. It has been fixed in 3.0.34.2, 3.1.10, 3.2.28, 3.3.21.4, 3.4.34.2, 3.5.8.4, and 3.6.11.   Ninja Forms is a&nbsp; customizable contact form builder &nbsp;that has over 1 million installations.  According to Wordfence, the bug "made it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call a limited number of methods in various Ninja Forms classes, including a method that unserialized user-supplied content, resulting in Object Injection."   "This could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or delete arbitrary files on sites where a separate [property oriented programming] chain was present," Chloe Chamberland of Wordfence&nbsp; noted .

A "dangerous piece of functionality" has been discovered in Microsoft 365 suite that could be potentially abused by a malicious actor to ransom files stored on SharePoint and OneDrive and launch attacks on cloud infrastructure.  The cloud ransomware attack makes it possible to launch file-encrypting malware to "encrypt files stored on SharePoint and OneDrive in a way that makes them unrecoverable without dedicated backups or a decryption key from the attacker," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today.  The infection sequence can be carried out using a combination of Microsoft APIs, command-line interface (CLI) scripts, and PowerShell scripts, the enterprise security firm added. The attack, at its core, hinges on a Microsoft 365 feature called AutoSave  that creates copies of older file versions as and when users make edits to a file stored on OneDrive or SharePoint Online.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a recently patched high-severity security vulnerability in the popular Fastjson library  that could be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-25845 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.1), the&nbsp; issue &nbsp;relates to a case of&nbsp; deserialization of untrusted data &nbsp;in a supported feature called "AutoType." It was patched by the project maintainers in&nbsp; version 1.2.83 &nbsp;released on May 23, 2022.   "This vulnerability affects all Java applications that rely on Fastjson versions 1.2.80 or earlier and that pass user-controlled data to either the JSON.parse or JSON.parseObject APIs without specifying a specific&nbsp; class &nbsp;to deserialize," JFrog's Uriya Yavnieli&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up.  Fastjson &nbsp;is a Java library that's used to convert Java Objects into their&nbsp; JSON &nbsp;representation and vice versa.&nbsp; AutoType , the function vulnerable to the flaw, is enabled by default and is designed to specify a custom type when parsing

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco on Wednesday rolled out fixes to address a critical security flaw affecting Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Secure Email and Web Manager that could be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to sidestep authentication.  Assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-20798 , the bypass vulnerability is rated 9.8 out of a maximum of 10 on the CVSS scoring system and stems from improper authentication checks when an affected device uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ( LDAP ) for external authentication.   "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering a specific input on the login page of the affected device," Cisco noted in an advisory. "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the web-based management interface of the affected device."  The flaw, which it said was identified during the resolution of a technical assistance center (TAC) case, impacts ESA and Secure Email and Web Manager running vulnerable

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly discovered security vulnerability in modern Intel and AMD processors could let remote attackers steal encryption keys via a power side channel attack.  Dubbed&nbsp; Hertzbleed &nbsp;by a group of researchers from the University of Texas, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Washington, the issue is rooted in dynamic voltage and frequency scaling ( DVFS ), power and thermal management feature employed to conserve power and reduce the amount of heat generated by a chip.  "The cause is that, under certain circumstances, periodic CPU frequency adjustments depend on the current CPU power consumption, and these adjustments directly translate to execution time differences (as 1 hertz = 1 cycle per second)," the researchers said.    This can have significant security implications on cryptographic libraries even when implemented correctly as&nbsp; constant-time code &nbsp;to prevent timing-based side channels, effectively enabling an attacker to leverage the execution t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has incorporated additional improvements to address the recently disclosed&nbsp; SynLapse &nbsp;security vulnerability in order to meet comprehensive&nbsp; tenant isolation &nbsp; requirements &nbsp;in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Pipelines.  The latest safeguards include moving the shared integration runtimes to sandboxed ephemeral instances and using scoped tokens to prevent adversaries from using a client certificate to access other tenants' information.  "This means that if an attacker could execute code on the&nbsp; integration runtime , it is never shared between two different tenants, so no sensitive data is in danger," Orca Security said in a technical report  detailing the flaw.   The high-severity issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-29972 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8) and disclosed early last month, could have allowed an attacker to perform remote command execution and gain access to another Azure client's cloud environment.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unpatched security issue in the Travis CI API has left tens of thousands of developers' user tokens exposed to potential attacks, effectively allowing threat actors to breach cloud infrastructures, make unauthorized code changes, and initiate supply chain attacks.  "More than 770 million logs of free tier users are available, from which you can easily extract tokens, secrets, and other credentials associated with popular cloud service providers such as GitHub, AWS, and Docker Hub," researchers from cloud security firm Aqua&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday report.  Travis CI is a&nbsp; continuous integration &nbsp;service used to build and test software projects hosted on cloud repository platforms such as GitHub and Bitbucket.   The issue, previously reported in 2015 and&nbsp; 2019 , is rooted in the fact that the&nbsp; API &nbsp;permits access to historical logs in cleartext format, enabling a malicious party to even "fetch the logs that were previously unavailable via the API."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A novel hardware attack dubbed&nbsp; PACMAN &nbsp;has been demonstrated against Apple's M1 processor chipsets, potentially arming a malicious actor with the capability to gain arbitrary code execution on macOS systems.  It leverages "speculative execution attacks to bypass an important memory protection mechanism, ARM Pointer Authentication, a security feature that is used to enforce pointer integrity," MIT researchers Joseph Ravichandran, Weon Taek Na, Jay Lang, and Mengjia Yan&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new paper. What's more concerning is that "while the hardware mechanisms used by PACMAN cannot be patched with software features, memory corruption bugs can be," the researchers added.  The vulnerability is rooted in pointer authentication codes ( PACs ), a line of defense introduced in arm64e architecture that aims to detect and secure against unexpected changes to&nbsp; pointers &nbsp;— objects that store a memory address — in memory.

Researchers Find Bluetooth Signals Can be Fingerprinted to Track Smartphones<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/researchers-find-bluetooth-signals-can.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new research undertaken by a group of academics from the University of California San Diego has revealed for the first time that Bluetooth signals can be fingerprinted to track smartphones (and therefore, individuals).  The identification, at its core, hinges on imperfections in the Bluetooth chipset hardware introduced during the manufacturing process, resulting in a "unique physical-layer fingerprint."  "To perform a physical-layer fingerprinting attack, the attacker must be equipped with a Software Defined Radio sniffer: a radio receiver capable of recording raw IQ radio signals," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a&nbsp; new paper &nbsp; titled &nbsp;"Evaluating Physical-Layer BLE Location Tracking Attacks on Mobile Devices."   The&nbsp; attack &nbsp;is made possible due to the ubiquitous nature of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons that are continuously transmitted by modern devices to enable crucial functions such as&nbsp; contact tracing &nbsp;during public health emergencies.

Researchers Disclose Critical Flaws in Industrial Access Control System from Carrier<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/researchers-disclose-critical-flaws-in.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as eight zero-day vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Carrier's LenelS2 HID Mercury access control system that's used widely in healthcare, education, transportation, and government facilities.  "The vulnerabilities uncovered allowed us to demonstrate the ability to remotely unlock and lock doors, subvert alarms and undermine logging and notification systems," Trellix security researchers Steve Povolny and Sam Quinn said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The issues, in a nutshell, could be weaponized by a malicious actor to gain full system control, including the ability to manipulate door locks. One of the bugs (CVE-2022-31481) includes an unauthenticated remote execution flaw that's rated 10 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS scoring system.   Other shortcomings could lead to command injection (CVE-2022-31479, CVE-2022-31486), denial-of-service (CVE-2022-31480, CVE-2022-31482), user modification (CVE-2022-31484), and information spoofing (CVE

Researchers Warn of Unpatched "DogWalk" Microsoft Windows Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/researchers-warn-of-unpatched-dogwalk.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unofficial security patch has been made available for a new Windows zero-day vulnerability in the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), even as the Follina flaw continues to be exploited in the wild.  The issue — referenced as&nbsp; DogWalk &nbsp;— relates to a path traversal flaw that can be exploited to stash a malicious executable file to the Windows Startup folder when a potential target opens a specially crafted ".diagcab" archive file that contains a diagnostics configuration file.  The idea is that the payload would get executed the next time the victim logs in to the system after a restart. The vulnerability affects all Windows versions, starting from Windows 7 and Server Server 2008 to the latest releases.   DogWalk was originally&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by security researcher Imre Rad in January 2020 after Microsoft, having acknowledged the problem, deemed it as not a security issue.  "There are a number of file types that can execute code in such a way but aren't techni

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed&nbsp; two unpatched security vulnerabilities &nbsp;in the open-source U-Boot boot loader.  The issues, which were uncovered in the&nbsp; IP defragmentation &nbsp;algorithm implemented in U-Boot by NCC Group, could be abused to achieve arbitrary out-of-bounds write and denial-of-service (DoS).  U-Boot is a&nbsp; boot loader &nbsp;used in Linux-based embedded systems such as ChromeOS as well as ebook readers such as Amazon Kindle and Kobo eReader.   The issues are summarized below -   CVE-2022-30790 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.6) - Hole Descriptor overwrite in U-Boot IP packet defragmentation leads to an arbitrary out-of-bounds write primitive.  CVE-2022-30552 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.1) - Large buffer overflow leads to DoS in U-Boot IP packet defragmentation code   It's worth noting that both the flaws are exploitable only from the local network. But doing so can enable an attacker to root the devices and lead to a DoS by crafting a malformed packet.  The shortcomings are expected to be addr

Microsoft Finds Critical Bugs in Pre-Installed Apps on Millions of Android Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/microsoft-finds-critical-bugs-in-pre.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Four high severity vulnerabilities have been disclosed in a framework used by pre-installed Android System apps with millions of downloads.  The issues, now fixed by its Israeli developer MCE Systems, could have potentially allowed threat actors to stage remote and local attacks or be abused as vectors to obtain sensitive information by taking advantage of their extensive system privileges.  "As it is with many of pre-installed or default applications that most Android devices come with these days, some of the affected apps cannot be fully uninstalled or disabled without gaining root access to the device," the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Friday.   The weaknesses, which range from command-injection to local privilege escalation, have been assigned the identifiers CVE-2021-42598, CVE-2021-42599, CVE-2021-42600, and CVE-2021-42601, with CVSS scores between 7.0 and 8.9.

Experts Detail New RCE Vulnerability Affecting Google Chrome Dev Channel<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/experts-detail-new-rce-vulnerability.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a recently patched critical remote code execution vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine used in Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.  The issue relates to a case of use-after-free in the instruction optimization component, successful exploitation of which could "allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser."  The flaw, which&nbsp; was identified &nbsp;in the Dev channel version of Chrome 101, was reported to Google by Weibo Wang, a security researcher at Singapore cybersecurity company&nbsp; Numen Cyber Technology &nbsp;and has since been quietly fixed by the company.   "This vulnerability occurs in the instruction selection stage, where the wrong instruction has been selected and resulting in memory access exception," Wang said .  Use-after-free flaws&nbsp; occur &nbsp;when previous-freed memory is accessed, inducing undefined behavior and causing a program to crash, use corrupted data, or even achieve execution

Attackers Can Use Electromagnetic Signals to Control Touchscreens Remotely<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/attackers-can-use-electromagnetic.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have demonstrated what they call the "first active contactless attack against capacitive touchscreens."  GhostTouch , as it's called, "uses electromagnetic interference (EMI) to inject fake touch points into a touchscreen without the need to physically touch it," a group of academics from Zhejiang University and Technical University of Darmstadt&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new research paper.  The core idea is to take advantage of the electromagnetic signals to execute basic touch events such as taps and swipes into targeted locations of the touchscreen with the goal of taking over remote control and manipulating the underlying device.   The attack, which works from a distance of up to 40mm, hinges on the fact that&nbsp; capacitive touchscreens &nbsp;are sensitive to EMI, leveraging it to inject electromagnetic signals into transparent electrodes that are built into the touchscreen so as to register them as touch events.  The experimental setup  involves an electrostatic gun

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Quanta Cloud Technology (QCT) servers have been identified as vulnerable to the severe "Pantsdown" Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) flaw, according to new research published today.  "An attacker running code on a vulnerable QCT server would be able to 'hop' from the server host to the BMC and move their attacks to the server management network, possibly continue and obtain further permissions to other BMCs on the network and by doing that gaining access to other servers," firmware and hardware security firm Eclypsium&nbsp; said .  A baseboard management controller is a specialized system used for remote monitoring and management of servers, including controlling low-level hardware settings as well as installing firmware and software updates.   Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2019-6260 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the&nbsp; critical security flaw &nbsp;came to light in January 2019 and relates to a case of arbitrary read and write access to the BMC's physical address space, resulting in a

In any organization, there are certain accounts that are designated as being privileged. These privileged accounts differ from standard user accounts in that they have permission to perform actions that go beyond what standard users can do. The actions vary based on the nature of the account but can include anything from setting up new user accounts to shutting down mission-critical systems.  Privileged accounts are essential tools. Without these accounts, the IT staff would be unable to do its job. At the same time, privileged accounts can pose a serious threat to an organization's security.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security researcher claims to have discovered an unpatched vulnerability in PayPal's money transfer service that could allow attackers to trick victims into unknowingly completing attacker-directed transactions with a single click.  Clickjacking, also called UI redressing, refers to a technique wherein an unwitting user is tricked into clicking seemingly innocuous webpage elements like buttons with the goal of downloading malware, redirecting to malicious websites, or disclose sensitive information.   This is typically achieved by displaying an invisible page or HTML element on top of the visible page, resulting in a scenario where users are fooled into thinking that they are clicking the legitimate page when they are in fact clicking the rogue element overlaid atop it.  "Thus, the attacker is 'hijacking' clicks meant for [the legitimate] page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain, or both," security researcher h4x0r

Cisco on Friday rolled out fixes for a medium-severity vulnerability affecting IOS XR Software that it said has been exploited in real-world attacks.  Tracked as CVE-2022-20821 (CVSS score: 6.5), the issue relates to an open port vulnerability that could be abused by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to connect to a Redis instance and achieve code execution.  "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write to the Redis in-memory database, write arbitrary files to the container filesystem, and retrieve information about the Redis database," Cisco&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory.   "Given the configuration of the sandboxed container that the Redis instance runs in, a remote attacker would be unable to execute remote code or abuse the integrity of the Cisco IOS XR Software host system."  The flaw, which it said was identified during the resolution of a technical assistance center (TAC) case, impacts Cisco 8000 Series routers running IOS XR Software that has the health

New Bluetooth Hack Could Let Attackers Remotely Unlock Smart Locks and Cars<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/new-bluetooth-hack-could-let-attackers.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A novel Bluetooth relay attack can let cybercriminals more easily than ever remotely&nbsp; unlock and operate cars ,&nbsp; break open residential smart locks , and breach secure areas.  The vulnerability has to do with weaknesses in the current implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a wireless technology used for authenticating Bluetooth devices that are physically located within a close range.   "An attacker can falsely indicate the proximity of Bluetooth LE (BLE) devices to one another through the use of a relay attack," U.K.-based cybersecurity company NCC Group&nbsp; said . "This may enable unauthorized access to devices in BLE-based proximity authentication systems."  Relay attacks , also called two-thief attacks, are a variation of person-in-the-middle attacks in which an adversary intercepts communication between two parties, one of whom is also an attacker, and then relays it to the target device without any manipulation.  While various mitigations have been implem

Google last month addressed a high-severity flaw in its OAuth client library for Java that could be abused by a malicious actor with a compromised token to deploy arbitrary payloads.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-22573 , the vulnerability is rated 8.7 out of 10 for severity and relates to an authentication bypass in the library that stems from an improper verification of the cryptographic signature.  Credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on March 12 is&nbsp; Tamjid Al Rahat , a fourth-year Ph.D. student of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, who has been awarded $5,000 as part of Google's bug bounty program.   "The vulnerability is that the IDToken verifier does not verify if the token is properly signed," an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;for the flaw reads.  "Signature verification makes sure that the token's payload comes from a valid provider, not from someone else. An attacker can provide a compromised token with custom payload.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware has issued patches to contain&nbsp; two security flaws &nbsp;impacting Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager, and vRealize Automation that could be exploited to backdoor enterprise networks.  The first of the two flaws, tracked as CVE-2022-22972 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns an authentication bypass that could enable an actor with network access to the UI to gain administrative access without prior authentication.  CVE-2022-22973 (CVSS score: 7.8), the other bug, is a case of local privilege escalation that could enable an attacker with local access to elevate privileges to the "root" user on vulnerable virtual appliances.  "It is extremely important that you quickly take steps to patch or mitigate these issues in on-premises deployments," VMware&nbsp; said .   The disclosure follows a&nbsp; warning &nbsp;from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are exploiting CVE-2022-22954 and CVE-2022-22960 — two other VMware flaws t

A first-of-its-kind security analysis of iOS Find My function has identified a novel attack surface that makes it possible to tamper with the firmware and load malware onto a Bluetooth chip that's executed while an iPhone is "off."  The mechanism takes advantage of the fact that wireless chips related to Bluetooth, Near-field communication ( NFC ), and ultra-wideband ( UWB ) continue to operate while iOS is shut down when entering a "power reserve" Low Power Mode (LPM).  While this is done so as to enable features like&nbsp; Find My &nbsp;and facilitate&nbsp; Express Card transactions , all the three wireless chips have direct access to the secure element, academics from the Secure Mobile Networking Lab ( SEEMOO ) at the Technical University of Darmstadt&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a paper.   "The Bluetooth and UWB chips are hardwired to the Secure Element (SE) in the NFC chip, storing secrets that should be available in LPM," the researchers said.  "Since LPM support is impleme

Microsoft on Monday disclosed that it mitigated a security flaw affecting Azure Synapse and Azure Data Factory that, if successfully exploited, could result in remote code execution.

"The vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to perform remote command execution across IR infrastructure not limited to a single tenant."

The maintainers of the RubyGems package manager have addressed a critical security flaw that could have been abused to remove gems and replace them with rogue versions under specific circumstances.  "Due to a bug in the yank action, it was possible for any RubyGems.org user to remove and replace certain gems even if that user was not authorized to do so," RubyGems&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a security advisory published on May 6, 2022.   RubyGems, like npm for JavaScript and pip for Python, is a&nbsp; package manager &nbsp;and a gem hosting service for the Ruby programming language, offering a repository of more than 171,500 libraries.  In a nutshell, the flaw in question, tracked as CVE-2022-29176, enabled anyone to pull certain gems and upload different files with the same name, same version number, and different platforms.

Days after F5 released patches for a critical remote code execution vulnerability affecting its BIG-IP family of products, security researchers are warning that they were able to create an exploit for the shortcoming.

Google has released monthly security patches for Android with fixes for 37 flaws across different components, one of which is a fix for an actively exploited Linux kernel vulnerability that came to light earlier this year.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-22600 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), the vulnerability is ranked "High" for severity and could be exploited by a local user to escalate privileges or deny service.  The issue relates to a&nbsp; double-free vulnerability &nbsp;residing in the&nbsp; Packet &nbsp;network protocol implementation in the Linux kernel that could cause memory corruption, potentially leading to denial-of-service or execution of arbitrary code.   Patches were released by different Linux distributions, including&nbsp; Debian ,&nbsp; Red Hat ,&nbsp; SUSE , and&nbsp; Ubuntu &nbsp;in January 2022.  "There are indications that CVE-2021-22600 may be under limited, targeted exploitation," Google&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in its Android Security Bulletin for May 2022. Specifics about the nature of the attacks are unknown as yet.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two high-severity security vulnerabilities, which went undetected for several years, have been discovered in a&nbsp; legitimate driver &nbsp;that's part of Avast and AVG antivirus solutions.  "These vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate privileges enabling them to disable security products, overwrite system components, corrupt the operating system, or perform malicious operations unimpeded," SentinelOne researcher Kasif Dekel&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.   Tracked as CVE-2022-26522 and CVE-2022-26523, the flaws reside in a legitimate anti-rootkit kernel driver named aswArPot.sys and are said to have been introduced in Avast version 12.1, which was released in June 2016.  Specifically, the shortcomings are rooted in a socket connection handler in the kernel driver that could lead to privilege escalation by running code in the kernel from a non-administrator user, potentially causing the operating system to crash and display a blue screen of death ( BSoD ) e

A pre-authenticated remote code execution vulnerability has been disclosed in dotCMS, an open-source content management system written in Java and " used by  over 10,000 clients in over 70 countries around the globe, from Fortune 500 brands and mid-sized businesses."  The critical flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-26352 , stems from a directory traversal attack when performing file uploads, enabling an adversary to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system.   "An attacker can upload arbitrary files to the system," Shubham Shah of Assetnote&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "By uploading a JSP file to the tomcat's root directory, it is possible to achieve code execution, leading to command execution."  In other words, the arbitrary file upload flaw can be abused to replace already existing files in the system with a web shell, which can then be used to gain persistent remote access.   Although the exploit made it possible to write to arbitrary JavaScript files bei

Critical TLStorm 2.0 Bugs Affect Widely-Used Aruba and Avaya Network Switches<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/critical-tlstorm-20-bugs-affect-widely.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed as many as five severe security flaws in the implementation of TLS protocol in several models of Aruba and Avaya network switches that could be abused to gain remote access to enterprise networks and steal valuable information.  The findings follow the March disclosure of&nbsp; TLStorm , a set of three critical flaws in APC Smart-UPS devices that could permit an attacker to take over control and, worse, physically damage the appliances.  IoT security firm Armis, which uncovered the shortcomings, noted that the design flaws can be traced back to a common source: a misuse of&nbsp; NanoSSL , a standards-based SSL developer suite from Mocana, a DigiCert subsidiary.   The new set of flaws, dubbed&nbsp; TLStorm 2.0 , renders Aruba and Avaya network switches vulnerable to remote code execution vulnerabilities, enabling an adversary to commandeer the devices, move laterally across the network, and exfiltrate sensitive data.  Affected devices include Avaya ERS3500 Seri

Unpatched DNS Related Vulnerability Affects a Wide Range of IoT Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/unpatched-dns-related-vulnerability.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed an unpatched security vulnerability that could pose a serious risk to IoT products.  The issue, which was originally reported in September 2021, affects the Domain Name System (DNS) implementation of two popular C libraries called&nbsp; uClibc &nbsp;and&nbsp; uClibc-ng &nbsp;that are used for developing embedded Linux systems.   uClibc is known to be used by major vendors such as Linksys, Netgear, and Axis, as well as Linux distributions like Embedded Gentoo, potentially exposing millions of IoT devices to security threats.  "The flaw is caused by the predictability of transaction IDs included in the DNS requests generated by the library, which may allow attackers to perform DNS poisoning attacks against the target device," Giannis Tsaraias and Andrea Palanca of Nozomi Networks&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday write-up.   DNS poisoning , also referred to as DNS spoofing, is the technique of corrupting a DNS resolver cache — which provides clients with the IP address a

According to folklore, witches were able to sail in a sieve, a strainer with holes in the bottom. Unfortunately, witches don't work in cybersecurity – where networks generally have so many vulnerabilities that they resemble sieves.&nbsp;  For most of us, keeping the sieve of our networks afloat requires nightmarishly hard work and frequent compromises on which holes to plug first.  The reason? In 2010, just under 5000 CVEs were recorded in the MITRE vulnerabilities database. By 2021, the yearly total had skyrocketed to&nbsp; over 20,000 . Today, software and network integrity are synonymous with business continuity. And this makes the issue of which vulnerabilities to address first mission-critical. Yet owing to the countless documented vulnerabilities lurking in a typical enterprise ecosystem – across thousands of laptops, servers, and internet-connected devices – less than&nbsp; one in ten &nbsp;actually needs to be patched. The question is: how can we know which patches will ensure that our sieve does

A "logical flaw" has been disclosed in NPM, the default package manager for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment, that enables malicious actors to pass off rogue libraries as legitimate and trick unsuspecting developers into installing them.  The supply chain threat has been dubbed "Package Planting" by researchers from cloud security firm Aqua. Following responsible disclosure on February 10, the underlying issue was remediated by NPM on April 26.   "Up until recently, NPM allowed adding anyone as a maintainer of the package without notifying these users or getting their consent," Aqua's Yakir Kadkoda&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday.  This effectively meant that an adversary could create malware-laced packages and assign them to trusted, popular maintainers without their knowledge.

Microsoft on Tuesday disclosed a set of two privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the Linux operating system that could potentially allow threat actors to carry out an array of nefarious activities.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrating a newly disclosed digital signature bypass vulnerability in Java has been shared online.&nbsp;  The&nbsp; high-severity flaw &nbsp;in question,&nbsp; CVE-2022-21449 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5), impacts the following version of Java SE and Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition -   Oracle Java SE: 7u331, 8u321, 11.0.14, 17.0.2, 18  Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.5, 21.3.1, 22.0.0.2   The issue resides in Java's implementation of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ( ECDSA ), a&nbsp; cryptographic mechanism &nbsp;to&nbsp; digitally sign &nbsp;messages and data for verifying the authenticity and the integrity of the contents.   In a nutshell, the cryptographic blunder — dubbed Psychic Signatures in Java — makes it possible to present a totally blank signature, which would still be perceived as valid by the vulnerable implementation.   Successful exploitation of the flaw could permit an attacker to forge signatures and bypass authentication measures put in place.  The PoC, p

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Networking equipment maker Cisco has released security updates to address three high-severity vulnerabilities in its products that could be exploited to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition and take control of affected systems.  The first of the three flaws,&nbsp; CVE-2022-20783 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5), affects Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software and Cisco RoomOS Software, and stems from a lack of proper input validation, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send specially crafted traffic to the devices.   "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to either reboot normally or reboot into maintenance mode, which could result in a DoS condition on the device," the company&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in an advisory.  Credited with discovering and reporting the flaw is the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The issue has been addressed in Cisco TelePresence CE Software versions 9.15.10.8 and 10.11.2.2.

Amazon's Hotpatch for Log4j Flaw Found Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation Bug<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/amazons-hotpatch-for-log4j-flaw-found.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The "hotpatch" released by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in response to the&nbsp; Log4Shell &nbsp;vulnerabilities could be leveraged for container escape and privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to seize control of the underlying host.  "Aside from containers, unprivileged processes can also exploit the patch to escalate privileges and gain root code execution," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researcher Yuval Avrahami&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week.   The issues —&nbsp; CVE-2021-3100 ,&nbsp; CVE-2021-3101 ,&nbsp; CVE-2022-0070 , and&nbsp; CVE-2022-0071 &nbsp;(CVSS scores: 8.8) — affect the&nbsp; hotfix solutions &nbsp;shipped by AWS, and stem from the fact that they are designed to search for Java processes and patch them against the Log4j flaw on the fly but without ensuring that the new Java processes are run within the restrictions imposed on the container.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unpatched high-severity security flaw has been disclosed in the open-source RainLoop web-based email client that could be weaponized to siphon emails from victims' inboxes.  "The code vulnerability [...] can be easily exploited by an attacker by sending a malicious email to a victim that uses RainLoop as a mail client," SonarSource security researcher Simon Scannell&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week.  "When the email is viewed by the victim, the attacker gains full control over the session of the victim and can steal any of their emails, including those that contain highly sensitive information such as passwords, documents, and password reset links."   Tracked as CVE-2022-29360, the flaw relates to a stored cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability impacting the latest version of RainLoop ( v1.16.0 ) that was released on May 7, 2021.

Three security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the audio decoders of Qualcomm and MediaTek chips that, if left unresolved, could allow an adversary to remotely gain access to media and audio conversations from affected mobile devices.  According to Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point , the issues could be used as a launchpad to carry out remote code execution (RCE) attacks simply by sending a specially crafted audio file.  "The impact of an RCE vulnerability can range from malware execution to an attacker gaining control over a user's multimedia data, including streaming from a compromised machine's camera," the researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "In addition, an unprivileged Android app could use these vulnerabilities to escalate its privileges and gain access to media data and user conversations."

Google Project Zero called 2021 a "record year for in-the-wild 0-days," as&nbsp; 58 security vulnerabilities &nbsp;were detected and disclosed during the course of the year.  The development marks more than a two-fold jump from the previous maximum when 28 0-day exploits were tracked in 2015. In contrast, only 25 0-day exploits were detected in 2020.  "The large uptick in in-the-wild 0-days in 2021 is due to increased detection and disclosure of these 0-days, rather than simply increased usage of 0-day exploits," Google Project Zero security researcher&nbsp; Maddie Stone &nbsp; said .   "Attackers are having success using the same bug patterns and exploitation techniques and going after the same attack surfaces," Stone added.  The tech giant's in-house security team characterized the exploits as similar to previous and publicly known vulnerabilities, with only two of them markedly different for the technical sophistication and use of logic bugs to escape the sandbox.

Hackers Exploiting Recently Reported Windows Print Spooler Vulnerability in the Wild<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/hackers-exploiting-recently-reported.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security flaw in the Windows Print Spooler component that was patched by Microsoft in February is being actively exploited in the wild, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has warned .  To that end, the agency has added the shortcoming to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog , requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to address the issues by May 10, 2022.   Tracked as CVE-2022-22718  (CVSS score: 7.8), the security vulnerability is one among the four privilege escalation flaws in the Print Spooler that Microsoft resolved as part of its Patch Tuesday updates  on February 8, 2022.  It's worth noting that the Redmond-based tech giant has remediated a number  of Print Spooler flaws since the critical PrintNightmare  remote code execution vulnerability came to light last year, including 15 elevation of privilege vulnerabilities  in April 2022.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Three high-impact Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) security vulnerabilities have been discovered impacting various Lenovo consumer laptop models, enabling malicious actors to deploy and execute firmware implants on the affected devices.  Tracked as CVE-2021-3970, CVE-2021-3971, and CVE-2021-3972, the latter two "affect firmware drivers originally meant to be used only during the manufacturing process of Lenovo consumer notebooks," ESET researcher Martin Smolár&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today.   "Unfortunately, they were mistakenly included also in the production BIOS images without being properly deactivated," Smolár added.  Successful exploitation of the flaws could permit an attacker to disable SPI flash protections or Secure Boot, effectively granting the adversary the ability to install persistent malware that can survive system reboots.   CVE-2021-3970, on the other hand, relates to a case of memory corruption in the System Management Mode ( SMM

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Elementor, a WordPress website builder plugin with over five million active installations, has been found to be vulnerable to an authenticated remote code execution flaw that could be abused to take over affected websites.  Plugin Vulnerabilities, which&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;the flaw last week, said the bug was introduced in version 3.6.0 that was released on March 22, 2022. Roughly&nbsp; 37% of users &nbsp;of the plugin are on version 3.6.x.   "That means that malicious code provided by the attacker can be run by the website," the researchers said. "In this instance, it is possible that the vulnerability might be exploitable by someone not logged in to WordPress, but it can easily be exploited by anyone logged in to WordPress who has access to the WordPress admin dashboard."  In a nutshell, the issue relates to a case of arbitrary file upload to affected websites, potentially leading to code execution.   The bug has been addressed in the latest version of Elementor, with Patchstack

As many as five security vulnerabilities have been addressed in Aethon Tug hospital robots that could enable remote attackers to seize control of the devices and interfere with the timely distribution of medication and lab samples.  "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a denial-of-service condition, allow full control of robot functions, or expose sensitive information," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published this week.  Aethon TUG smart autonomous mobile robots are used in hospitals around the world to deliver medication, transport clinical supplies, and independently navigate around to perform different tasks such as cleaning floors and collecting meal trays.   Collectively dubbed " JekyllBot:5 " by Cynerio, the flaws reside in the TUG Homebase Server component, effectively allowing attackers to impede the delivery of medications, surveil patients, staff, and hospital interiors thr

Cisco has released patches to contain a critical security vulnerability affecting the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) that could be abused by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to take control of an affected system.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-20695 , the issue has been rated 10 out of 10 for severity and enables an adversary to bypass authentication controls and log in to the device through the management interface of WLC.  "This vulnerability is due to the improper implementation of the password validation algorithm," the company said in an advisory. "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device with crafted credentials."   Successful exploitation of the flaw could permit an attacker to gain administrator privileges and carry out malicious actions in a manner that allows a complete takeover of the vulnerable system.  The company stressed that the issue only affects the following products if running Cisco WLC Software Release 8.10.151.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud computing and virtualization technology firm VMWare on Thursday rolled out an update to resolve a critical security flaw in its Cloud Director product that could be weaponized to launch remote code execution attacks.  The issue, assigned the identifier&nbsp; CVE-2022-22966 , has a CVSS score of 9.1 out of a maximum of 10. VMware credited security researcher Jari Jääskelä with reporting the flaw.   "An authenticated, high privileged malicious actor with network access to the VMware Cloud Director tenant or provider may be able to exploit a remote code execution vulnerability to gain access to the server," VMware&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory.  VMware Cloud Director, formerly known as vCloud Director, is used by many well-known cloud providers to operate and manage their cloud infrastructures and gain visibility into datacenters across sites and geographies.

Critical LFI Vulnerability Reported in Hashnode Blogging Platform<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/critical-lfi-vulnerability-reported-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed a previously undocumented local file inclusion ( LFI ) vulnerability in&nbsp; Hashnode , a developer-oriented blogging platform, that could be abused to access sensitive data such as SSH keys, server's IP address, and other network information.  "The LFI originates in a&nbsp; Bulk Markdown Import feature &nbsp;that can be manipulated to provide attackers with unimpeded ability to download local files from Hashnode's server," Akamai researchers said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.   Local file inclusion flaws occur when a web application is tricked into exposing or running unapproved files on a server, leading to directory traversal, information disclosure, remote code execution, and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.   The flaw, caused due to the web application failing to adequately sanitize the path to a file that's passed as input, could have serious repercussions in that an assailant could navigate to any path on the server and access s

NGINX Shares Mitigations for Zero-Day Bug Affecting LDAP Implementation<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/nginx-shares-mitigations-for-zero-day.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The maintainers of the NGINX web server project have issued mitigations to address security weaknesses in its Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ( LDAP ) Reference Implementation.  "NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus are not themselves affected, and no corrective action is necessary if you do not use the reference implementation," Liam Crilly and Timo Stark of F5 Networks&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published Monday.   NGINX said that the&nbsp; reference implementation , which&nbsp; uses LDAP to authenticate users , is impacted only under three conditions if the deployments involve -   Command-line parameters to configure the Python-based reference implementation daemon  Unused, optional configuration parameters, and  Specific group membership to carry out LDAP authentication    Should any of the aforementioned conditions be met, an attacker could potentially override the configuration parameters by sending specially crafted HTTP request headers and even bypass group membership requirement

Brokenwire Hack Could Let Remote Attackers Disrupt Charging for Electric Vehicles<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/brokenwire-hack-could-let-remote.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics from the University of Oxford and Armasuisse S+T has disclosed details of a new attack technique against the popular Combined Charging System ( CCS ) that could potentially disrupt the ability to charge electric vehicles at scale.  Dubbed " Brokenwire ," the method interferes with the control communications that transpire between the vehicle and charger to wirelessly abort the charging sessions from a distance of as far as 47m (151ft).  "While it may only be an inconvenience for individuals, interrupting the charging process of critical vehicles, such as electric ambulances, can have life-threatening consequences," the researchers&nbsp; explained .   "Brokenwire has immediate implications for many of the 12 million battery EVs estimated to be on the roads worldwide — and profound effects on the new wave of electrification for vehicle fleets, both for private enterprise and for crucial public services."

15-Year-Old Bug in PEAR PHP Repository Could've Enabled Supply Chain Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/15-year-old-bug-in-pear-php-repository.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A 15-year-old security vulnerability has been disclosed in the PEAR PHP repository that could permit an attacker to carry out a supply chain attack, including obtaining unauthorized access to publish rogue packages and execute arbitrary code.  "An attacker exploiting the first one could take over any developer account and publish malicious releases, while the second bug would allow the attacker to gain persistent access to the central PEAR server," SonarSource vulnerability researcher Thomas Chauchefoin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published this week.  PEAR, short for PHP Extension and Application Repository, is a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components.   One of the issues, introduced in a&nbsp; code commit &nbsp;made in March 2007 when the feature was originally implemented, relates to the use of the cryptographically insecure&nbsp; mt_rand() &nbsp;PHP function in the password reset functionality that could allow an attacker to "discover a valid password reset token in les

DevOps platform GitLab has released software updates to address a critical security vulnerability that, if potentially exploited, could permit an adversary to seize control of accounts.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-1162 , the issue has a CVSS score of 9.1 and is said to have been discovered internally by the GitLab team.   "A hardcoded password was set for accounts registered using an&nbsp; OmniAuth provider &nbsp;(e.g., OAuth, LDAP, SAML) in GitLab CE/EE versions 14.7 prior to 14.7.7, 14.8 prior to 14.8.5, and 14.9 prior to 14.9.2 allowing attackers to potentially take over accounts," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published on March 31.  GitLab, which has addressed the bug with the latest release of versions 14.9.2, 14.8.5, and 14.7.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE), also said it took the step of resetting the password of an unspecified number of users out of an abundance of caution.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two new security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Rockwell Automation's programmable logic controllers ( PLCs ) and engineering workstation software that could be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code on affected systems and stealthily modify automation processes.  The flaws have the potential to disrupt industrial operations and cause physical damage to factories in a manner similar to that of Stuxnet and the&nbsp; Rogue7 attacks , operational technology security company Claroty said.   "Programmable logic and predefined variables drive these [automation] processes, and changes to either will alter normal operation of the PLC and the process it manages," Claroty's Sharon Brizinov&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in a write-up published Thursday.   The list of two flaws is below –   CVE-2022-1161 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 10.0) – A remotely exploitable flaw that allows a malicious actor to write user-readable "textual" program code to a separate memory location from the executed c

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Three security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the popular Wyze Cam devices that grant malicious actors to execute arbitrary code and access camera feeds as well as unauthorizedly read the SD cards, the latter of which remained unresolved for nearly three years after the initial discovery.  The security flaws relate to an authentication bypass (CVE-2019-9564), a remote code execution bug stemming from a stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2019-12266), and a case of unauthenticated access to the contents of the SD card (no CVE).   Successful exploitation of the bypass vulnerability could allow an outside attacker to fully control the device, including disabling recording to the SD card and turning on/off the camera, not to mention chaining it with CVE-2019-12266 to view the live audio and video feeds.  Romanian cybersecurity firm Bitdefender, which&nbsp; discovered the shortcomings , said it reached out to the vendor way back in May 2019, following which Wyze released patches to fix CVE

A zero-day remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability has come to light in the Spring framework shortly after a Chinese security researcher&nbsp; briefly leaked &nbsp;a&nbsp; proof-of-concept &nbsp;(PoC)&nbsp; exploit &nbsp;on GitHub before deleting their account.

Spring is a&nbsp; software framework &nbsp;for building Java applications, including web apps on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform.   "In certain configurations, exploitation of this issue is straightforward, as it only requires an attacker to send a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable system," researchers Anthony Weems and Dallas Kaman&nbsp; said .

Honda's Keyless Access Bug Could Let Thieves Remotely Unlock and Start Vehicles<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/hondas-keyless-access-bug-could-let.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A duo of researchers has released a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the ability for a malicious actor to remote lock, unlock, and even start Honda and Acura vehicles by means of what's called a replay attack.  The attack is made possible, thanks to a vulnerability in its remote keyless system ( CVE-2022-27254 ) that affects Honda Civic LX, EX, EX-L, Touring, Si, and Type R models manufactured between 2016 and 2020. Credited with discovering the issue are Ayyappan Rajesh, a student at UMass Dartmouth, and Blake Berry (HackingIntoYourHeart).   "A hacker can gain complete and unlimited access to locking, unlocking, controlling the windows, opening the trunk, and starting the engine of the target vehicle where the only way to prevent the attack is to either never use your fob or, after being compromised (which would be difficult to realize), resetting your fob at a dealership," Berry&nbsp; explained &nbsp;in a GitHub post.  The underlying issue is that the remote key fob on the a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
SonicWall has released security updates to contain a critical flaw across multiple firewall appliances that could be weaponized by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-22274 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.4), the issue has been described as a stack-based buffer overflow in the web management interface of SonicOS that could be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request, leading to remote code execution or DoS.   The flaw impacts 31 different SonicWall Firewall devices running versions 7.0.1-5050 and earlier, 7.0.1-R579 and earlier, and 6.5.4.4-44v-21-1452 and earlier. ZiTong Wang of Hatlab has been credited with reporting the issue.   The network security company&nbsp; said &nbsp;it's not aware of any instance of active exploitation in the wild leveraging the weakness, and that no proof-of-concept (PoC) or malicious use of the vulnerability has been publicly reported to date.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Friday shipped an out-of-band security update to address a high severity vulnerability in its Chrome browser that it said is being actively exploited in the wild.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-1096 , the zero-day flaw relates to a type confusion vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript engine. An anonymous researcher has been credited with reporting the bug on March 23, 2022.  Type confusion errors, which arise when a resource (e.g., a variable or an object) is accessed using a type that's incompatible to what was originally initialized, could have serious consequences in languages that are not&nbsp; memory safe &nbsp;like C and C++, enabling a malicious actor to perform out-of-bounds memory access.   "When a memory buffer is accessed using the wrong type, it could read or write memory out of the bounds of the buffer, if the allocated buffer is smaller than the type that the code is attempting to access, leading to a crash and possibly code execution," MITRE's Common Weakness Enum

"Invocation of CVE-2022-0811 can allow an attacker to perform a variety of actions on objectives, including execution of malware, exfiltration of data, and lateral movement across pods," CrowdStrike researchers John Walker and Manoj Ahuje&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published this week.  A lightweight alternative to Docker,&nbsp; CRI-O &nbsp;is a&nbsp; container runtime &nbsp;implementation of the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) that's used to pull container images from registries and launch an Open Container Initiative ( OCI )-compatible runtime such as runC to spawn and run container processes.   The vulnerability is rated 8.8 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system and affects CRI-O versions 1.19 and later. Following responsible disclosure, patches have been released to address the fl

A newly disclosed security flaw in the Linux kernel could be leveraged by a local adversary to gain elevated privileges on vulnerable systems to execute arbitrary code, escape containers, or induce a&nbsp; kernel panic .  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-25636 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), the vulnerability impacts Linux kernel versions 5.4 through 5.6.10 and is a result of a heap out-of-bounds write in the netfilter subcomponent in the kernel. The issue was&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;by Nick Gregory, a research scientist at Capsule8.   "This flaw allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash or a privilege escalation threat," Red Hat&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published on February 22, 2022. Similar alerts have been released by&nbsp; Debian ,&nbsp; Oracle Linux ,&nbsp; SUSE , and&nbsp; Ubuntu .

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in popular package managers that, if potentially exploited, could be abused to run arbitrary code and access sensitive information, including source code and access tokens, from compromised machines.  It's, however, worth noting that the flaws require the targeted developers to handle a malicious package in conjunction with one of the affected package managers.  "This means that an attack cannot be launched directly against a developer machine from remote and requires that the developer is tricked into loading malformed files," SonarSource researcher Paul Gerste&nbsp; said . "But can you always know and trust the owners of all packages that you use from the internet or company-internal repositories?"   Package managers refer to&nbsp; systems &nbsp;or a set of tools that are used to automate installing, upgrading, configuring third-party dependencies required for developing applications.

Researchers have disclosed a new technique that could be used to circumvent existing hardware mitigations in modern processors from Intel, AMD, and Arm and stage&nbsp; speculative execution &nbsp;attacks such as Spectre to leak sensitive information from host memory.  Attacks like&nbsp; Spectre &nbsp;are designed to break the isolation between different applications by taking advantage of an&nbsp; optimization technique &nbsp;called speculative execution in CPU hardware implementations to trick programs into accessing arbitrary locations in memory and thus leak their secrets.   While chipmakers have incorporated both software and hardware&nbsp; defenses , including&nbsp; Retpoline &nbsp;as well as safeguards like Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation ( eIBRS ) and&nbsp; Arm &nbsp; CSV2 , the latest method demonstrated by VUSec researchers aim to get around all these protections.   Called&nbsp; Branch History Injection &nbsp;(BHI or Spectre-BHB), it's a new variant of Spectre-V2 attacks (tracked as CVE-2017-5715) that bypasses both eIB

Three high-impact security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in&nbsp; APC Smart-UPS devices &nbsp;that could be abused by remote adversaries as a physical weapon to access and control them in an unauthorized manner.

The Continuing Threat of Unpatched Security Vulnerabilities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/the-continuing-threat-of-unpatched.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Unpatched software is a computer code containing known security weaknesses. Unpatched vulnerabilities refer to weaknesses that allow attackers to leverage a known security bug that has not been patched by running malicious code. Software vendors write additions to the codes, known as "patches," when they come to know about these application vulnerabilities to secure these weaknesses.  Adversaries often probe into your software, looking for unpatched systems and attacking them directly or indirectly. It is risky to run unpatched software. This is because attackers get the time to become aware of the&nbsp; software's unpatched vulnerabilities &nbsp;before a patch emerges.  A&nbsp; report &nbsp;found that unpatched vulnerabilities are the most consistent and primary ransomware attack vectors. It was recorded that in 2021,&nbsp; 65 &nbsp;new vulnerabilities arose that were connected to ransomware. This was observed to be a twenty-nine percent growth compared to the number of vulnerabilities in 2020.&nbsp;  Gr

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Linux distributions are in the process of issuing patches to address a newly disclosed security vulnerability in the kernel that could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary data into any read-only files and allow for a complete takeover of affected systems.  Dubbed " Dirty Pipe " (CVE-2022-0847, CVSS score: 7.8) by IONOS software developer Max Kellermann, the flaw "leads to privilege escalation because unprivileged processes can inject code into root processes."  Kellerman said the bug was discovered after digging into a support issue raised by one of the customers of the cloud and hosting provider that concerned a case of a "surprising kind of corruption" affecting web server access logs.  The Linux kernel flaw is said to have existed since&nbsp; version 5.8 , with the vulnerability sharing similarities to that of&nbsp; Dirty Cow &nbsp;(CVE-2016-5195), which came to light in October 2016.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a now-patched high-severity vulnerability in the Linux kernel that could potentially be abused to escape a container in order to execute arbitrary commands on the container host.  The shortcoming resides in a Linux kernel feature called&nbsp; control groups , also referred to as cgroups version 1 (v1), which allows processes to be organized into hierarchical groups, thereby making it possible to limit and monitor the usage of resources such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-0492 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.0), the&nbsp; issue &nbsp; concerns &nbsp;a&nbsp; case &nbsp;of&nbsp; privilege escalation &nbsp;in the cgroups v1 release_agent functionality, a script that's executed following the termination of any process in the cgroup.  "The issue stands out as one of the simplest Linux privilege escalations discovered in recent times: The Linux kernel mistakenly exposed a privileged operation to unprivileged users," Unit 42 researcher Yuval Avrahami&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report publishe

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco this week shipped patches to address a new round of critical security vulnerabilities affecting Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) that could be exploited by an attacker to gain elevated privileges and execute arbitrary code.  The two flaws – tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-20754 and CVE-2022-20755 &nbsp;(CVSS scores: 9.0) – relate to an arbitrary file write and a command injection flaw in the API and web-based management interfaces of the two products that could have serious impacts on affected systems.  The company said both the issues stem from insufficient input validation of user-supplied command arguments, a weakness that could be weaponized by an authenticated, remote attacker to carry out directory traversal attacks, overwrite arbitrary files, and run malicious code on the underlying operating system as the root user.

An analysis of data crowdsourced from more than 200,000 network-connected infusion pumps used in hospitals and healthcare entities has revealed that 75% of those medical devices contain security weaknesses that could put them at risk of potential exploitation.  "These shortcomings included exposure to one or more of some 40 known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or alerts that they had one or more of some 70 other types of known security shortcomings for IoT devices," Unit 42 security researcher Aveek Das&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Wednesday.   Palo Alto Networks' threat intelligence team said it obtained the scans from seven medical device manufacturers.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics from Tel Aviv University have disclosed details of now-patched "severe" design flaws affecting about 100 million Android-based Samsung smartphones that could have resulted in the extraction of secret cryptographic keys.  The shortcomings are the result of an analysis of the cryptographic design and implementation of Android's hardware-backed Keystore in Samsung's Galaxy S8, S9, S10, S20, and S21 flagship devices, researchers Alon Shakevsky, Eyal Ronen, and Avishai Wool&nbsp; said .  Trusted Execution Environments ( TEEs ) are a secure zone that provide an isolated environment for the execution of Trusted Applications (TAs) to carry out security critical tasks to ensure confidentiality and integrity.   On Android, the hardware-backed&nbsp; Keystore &nbsp;is a system that facilitates the creation and storage of cryptographic keys within the TEE, making them more difficult to be extracted from the device in a manner that prevents the underlying operating system fr

Cybersecurity researchers have managed to build a clone of Apple Airtag that circumvents the anti-stalking protection technology built into its Find My Bluetooth-based tracking protocol.  The result is a stealth AirTag that can successfully track an iPhone user for over five days without triggering a tracking notification, Positive Security's co-founder Fabian Bräunlein&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep-dive published last week.  Find My is Apple's asset tracking app that allows users to track the GPS location of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS devices, AirPods, AirTags as well as other supported third-party accessories through a connected iCloud account. It also enables users to view the location of others who have opted to share their location.   This is far from the first time weaknesses have been uncovered in Apple's Find My system.

Cisco has released software updates to address four security vulnerabilities in its software that could be weaponized by malicious actors to take control of affected systems.  The most critical of the flaws is&nbsp; CVE-2022-20650 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), which relates to a command injection flaw in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software that stems from a lack of sufficient input validation of user-supplied data.  "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the NX-API of an affected device," Cisco said. "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system."   The flaw impacts Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, and Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode running Cisco NX-OS Software that have the NX-API feature enabled.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Canonical's&nbsp; Snap &nbsp;software packaging and deployment system, the most critical of which can be exploited to escalate privilege to gain root privileges.  Snaps are self-contained application packages that are designed to work on operating systems that use the Linux kernel and can be installed using a tool called snapd.   Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-44731 , the issue concerns a privilege escalation flaw in the&nbsp; snap-confine &nbsp;function, a program used internally by snapd to construct the execution environment for snap applications. The shortcoming is rated 7.8 on the CVSS scoring system.   "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows any unprivileged user to gain root privileges on the vulnerable host," Bharat Jogi, director of vulnerability and threat research at Qualys,&nbsp; said , adding the weakness could be abused to "obtain full root privileges on default installations of Ubuntu."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco has released security updates to contain three vulnerabilities affecting its products, including one high-severity flaw in its Email Security Appliance (ESA) that could result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on an affected device.  The weakness, assigned the identifier CVE-2022-20653 (CVSS score: 7.5), stems from a case of insufficient error handling in&nbsp; DNS &nbsp;name resolution that could be abused by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send a specially crafted email message and cause a DoS.   "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to become unreachable from management interfaces or to process additional email messages for a period of time until the device recovers, resulting in a DoS condition," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "Continued attacks could cause the device to become completely unavailable, resulting in a persistent DoS condition."  The flaw impacts Cisco ESA devices running Cisco AsyncOS Software running vers

Researchers have revealed details of a now-patched high-severity security vulnerability in Apache Cassandra that, if left unaddressed, could be abused to gain remote code execution (RCE) on affected installations.  "This Apache security vulnerability is easy to exploit and has the potential to wreak havoc on systems, but luckily only manifests in non-default configurations of Cassandra," Omer Kaspi, security researcher at DevOps firm JFrog,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published Tuesday.  Apache Cassandra is an open-source, distributed, NoSQL database management system for managing very large amounts of structured data across commodity servers.

Adobe on Sunday rolled out patches to contain a critical security vulnerability impacting its Commerce and Magento Open Source products that it said is being actively exploited in the wild.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-24086 , the shortcoming has a CVSS score of 9.8 out of 10 on the vulnerability scoring system and has been characterized as an " improper input validation " issue that could be weaponized to achieve arbitrary code execution.&nbsp;   It's also a pre-authenticated flaw, meaning it could be exploited without requiring any credentials. But the California-headquartered company also pointed out that the vulnerability is only exploitable by an attacker with administrative privileges.  The flaw affects Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source 2.4.3-p1 and earlier versions as well as 2.3.7-p2 and earlier versions. Adobe Commerce 2.3.3 and lower are not vulnerable.   "Adobe is aware that CVE-2022-24086 has been exploited in the wild in very limited attacks targeting Adobe Co

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor, likely Chinese in origin, is actively attempting to exploit a zero-day vulnerability in the Zimbra open-source email platform as part of spear-phishing campaigns that commenced in December 2021.  The espionage operation — codenamed " EmailThief " — was detailed by cybersecurity company Volexity in a technical report published Thursday, noting that successful exploitation of the cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability could result in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's Zimbra session.   Volexity attributed the intrusions, which started on December 14, 2021, to a previously undocumented hacking group it's tracking under the moniker TEMP_HERETIC, with the assaults aimed at European government and media entities. The zero-day bug impacts the most recent open-source edition of Zimbra running&nbsp; version 8.8.15 .   The attacks are believed to have occurred in two phases; the first stage aimed at reconnaissance and distribut

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco has patched multiple critical&nbsp; security vulnerabilities &nbsp;impacting its RV Series routers that could be weaponized to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code on affected systems, while also warning of the existence of proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code targeting some of these bugs.  Three of the 15 flaws, tracked as CVE-2022-20699, CVE-2022-20700, and CVE-2022-20707, carry the highest CVSS rating of 10.0, and affect its Small Business RV160, RV260, RV340, and RV345 Series routers.  Additionally, the flaws could be exploited to bypass authentication and authorization protections, retrieve and run unsigned software, and even cause denial-of-service (DoS) conditions.   The networking equipment maker acknowledged that it's "aware that proof-of-concept exploit code is available for several of the vulnerabilities" but didn't share any further specifics on the nature of the exploit or the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting them.

As many as 23 new high severity security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in different implementations of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) firmware used by numerous vendors, including Bull Atos, Fujitsu, HP, Juniper Networks, Lenovo, among others.  The vulnerabilities reside in Insyde Software's InsydeH2O UEFI firmware, according to enterprise firmware security company&nbsp; Binarly , with a majority of the anomalies diagnosed in the System Management Mode ( SMM ).  UEFI is a software specification that provides a standard programming interface connecting a computer's firmware to its operating system during the booting process. In x86 systems, the UEFI firmware is usually stored in the flash memory chip of the motherboard.   "By exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers can successfully install malware that survives operating system re-installations and allows the bypass of endpoint security solutions (EDR/AV),&nbsp; Secure Boot , and Virtualization-Based Securit

A WordPress plugin with over one million installs has been found to contain a critical vulnerability that could result in the execution of arbitrary code on compromised websites.  The plugin in question is&nbsp; Essential Addons for Elementor , which provides WordPress site owners with a library of over 80 elements and extensions to help design and customize pages and posts.  "This vulnerability allows any user, regardless of their authentication or authorization status, to perform a local file inclusion attack," Patchstack&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "This attack can be used to include local files on the filesystem of the website, such as /etc/passwd. This can also be used to perform RCE by including a file with malicious PHP code that normally cannot be executed."   That said, the vulnerability only exists if widgets like dynamic gallery and product gallery are used, which utilize the vulnerable function, resulting in local file inclusion – an attack technique in which a web

Apple last year fixed a new set of macOS vulnerabilities that exposed Safari browser to attack, potentially allowing malicious actors to access users' online accounts, microphone, and webcam.  Security researcher Ryan Pickren, who discovered and reported the bugs to the iPhone maker, was compensated with a $100,500 bug bounty, underscoring the severity of the issues.  By exploiting a chain of security issues with iCloud Sharing and Safari 15, it enables the attacker to hijack the multimedia permission and gain "full access to every website ever visited by the victim" in Safari, including Gmail, iCloud, Facebook, and PayPal accounts.   The&nbsp; issues&nbsp; specifically concern ShareBear, an iCloud file-sharing mechanism that prompts users upon attempting to open a shared document for the first time. Taking advantage of the fact that users are never displayed the prompt again once they accept to open the file, Pickren found that it's possible to alter the file's content to

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
There are three things you can be sure of in life: death, taxes – and new CVEs. For organizations that rely on CentOS 8, the inevitable has now happened, and it didn't take long. Just two weeks after reaching the official end of life, something broke spectacularly, leaving&nbsp; CentOS 8 &nbsp;users at major risk of a severe attack – and with no support from CentOS.  You'd think that this issue no longer affects a significant number of organizations because by now, companies would have migrated away from CentOS 8 to an OS that is actively supported by vendors. After all, vendor support is critical for security and compliance.  But as it always is with these things, you can count on the fact that a big chunk of CentOS 8 users are soldiering on with an unsupported OS, despite being aware of the risks. With that risk now crystallizing we're using this article to examine&nbsp; CVE-2021-4122 , the newly discovered vulnerability in LUKS encryption, and to discuss your options for mitigating it.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple on Wednesday&nbsp; released &nbsp;iOS 15.3 and macOS Monterey 12.2 with a fix for the privacy-defeating bug in Safari, as well as to contain a zero-day flaw, which it said has been exploited in the wild to break into its devices.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-22587 , the vulnerability relates to a memory corruption issue in the IOMobileFrameBuffer component that could be abused by a malicious application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.  The iPhone maker said it's "aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited," adding it addressed the issue with improved input validation. It did not reveal the nature of the attacks, how widespread they are, or the identities of the threat actors exploiting them.   An anonymous researcher along with Meysam Firouzi and Siddharth Aeri have been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw.  CVE-2022-22587 is the third zero-day vulnerability discovered in IOMobileFrameBuffer in a span of six months after&nbsp; CVE-2

A 12-year-old security vulnerability has been disclosed in a system utility called Polkit that grants attackers root privileges on Linux systems, even as a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit has emerged in the wild merely hours after technical details of the bug became public.  Dubbed "PwnKit" by cybersecurity firm Qualys, the weakness impacts a component in polkit called pkexec, a program that's installed by default on every major Linux distribution such as Ubunti, Debian, Fedora, and CentOS.  Polkit &nbsp;(formerly called PolicyKit ) is a toolkit for controlling system-wide privileges in Unix-like operating systems, and provides a mechanism for non-privileged processes to communicate with privileged processes.   "This vulnerability allows any unprivileged user to gain full root privileges on a vulnerable host by exploiting this vulnerability in its default configuration," Bharat Jogi, director of vulnerability and threat research at Qualys,&nbsp; said , adding it "has

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The maintainers of the Rust programming language have released a security update for a high-severity vulnerability that could be abused by a malicious party to purge files and directories from a vulnerable system in an unauthorized manner.  "An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete," the Rust Security Response working group (WG)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;published on January 20, 2021.   Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability. The flaw, which is tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-21658 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.3), has been credited to security researcher Hans Kratz, with the team pushing out a fix in&nbsp; Rust version 1.58.1 &nbsp;shipped last week.  Specifically, the issue stems from an improperly implemented check to prevent recursive deletion of symbolic links (aka&nbsp; symlinks ) in a standard library function named "std::fs::remove_dir_all."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco Systems has rolled out fixes for a critical security flaw affecting Redundancy Configuration Manager (RCM) for Cisco StarOS Software that could be weaponized by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and take over vulnerable machines.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-20649 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.0), the vulnerability stems from the fact that the debug mode has been incorrectly enabled for specific services.  "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the device and navigating to the service with debug mode enabled," Cisco said in an advisory. "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the root user."  The network equipment maker, however, noted that the adversary would need to perform detailed reconnaissance to allow for unauthenticated access to vulnerable devices.   Stating that the vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing, Cisco added it found no evidence of active exploitat

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An exploration of zero-click attack surface for the popular video conferencing solution Zoom has yielded two previously undisclosed security vulnerabilities that could have been exploited to crash the service, execute malicious code, and even leak arbitrary areas of its memory.  Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero, who&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;and reported the&nbsp; two &nbsp; flaws &nbsp;last year, said the issues impacted both Zoom clients and Multimedia Router (MMR) servers, which transmit audio and video content between clients in&nbsp; on-premise deployments .  The weaknesses have since been addressed by Zoom as part of&nbsp; updates &nbsp;shipped on November 24, 2021.  The goal of a zero-click attack is to stealthily gain control over the victim's device without requiring any kind of interaction from the user, such as clicking on a link.   While the specifics of the exploit will vary depending on the nature of vulnerability being exploited, a key trait of zero-click hacks is their ability not to leave behind

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a now-patched bug in Box's multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanism that could be abused to completely sidestep SMS-based login verification.  "Using this technique, an attacker could use stolen credentials to compromise an organization's Box account and exfiltrate sensitive data without access to the victim's phone," Varonis researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The cybersecurity company said it reported the issue to the cloud service provider on November 2, 2021, post which fixes were issued by Box.   MFA is an authentication method that relies on a combination of factors such as a password (something only the user knows) and a temporary one-time password aka TOTP (something only the user has) to provide users a second layer of defense against credential stuffing and other account takeover attacks.  This two-step authentication can either involve sending the code as an SMS or alternat

I like the fact that I do not have to worry about accessing the Internet while I am away, or spending a lot of money on an international connection, or just staying offline while I am away.  With public Wi-Fi, modern life has become a constant connection to the Internet, whether we are on the bus, on the way to school or work, waiting for our flight in the airport or during the flight itself, or doing our homework or working on our projects in a café.  We do business and communicate online in a variety of ways. We check our work emails, chat with our friends, and even take business calls online through the service.  According to recent statistics, there are about 410,000 public Wi-Fi hotspots in the United States alone, in public places such as parks, libraries, public transportation, and train stations.

A software bug introduced in Apple Safari 15's implementation of the IndexedDB API could be abused by a malicious website to track users' online activity in the web browser and worse, even reveal their identity.  The vulnerability, dubbed&nbsp; IndexedDB Leaks , was disclosed by fraud protection software company FingerprintJS, which&nbsp; reported the issue &nbsp;to the iPhone maker on November 28, 2021.  IndexedDB is a low-level JavaScript application programming interface (API) provided by web browsers for managing a&nbsp; NoSQL database &nbsp;of structured data objects such as files and blobs.   "Like most web storage solutions, IndexedDB follows a same-origin policy," Mozilla&nbsp; notes in its documentation &nbsp;of the API. "So while you can access stored data within a domain, you cannot access data across different domains."  Same-origin is a&nbsp; fundamental security mechanism &nbsp;that ensures that resources retrieved from distinct&nbsp; origins &nbsp;— i.e., a&nbsp; combination &nbsp;of the scheme (protocol),

Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-20658 , the vulnerability has been rated 9.6 in severity on the CVSS scoring system, and concerns a privilege escalation flaw arising out of a lack of server-side validation of user permissions that could be weaponized to create rogue Administrator accounts by submitting a crafted HTTP request.   "With these accounts, the attacker could access and modify telephony and user resources across all the Unified platforms that are associated to the vulnerable Cisco Unified CCMP," Cisco&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in an advisory published this week. " To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Advanced User credentials."   Unified CCMP and Unified CCDM pro

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a high severity flaw in KCodes NetUSB component that's integrated into millions of end-user router devices from Netgear, TP-Link, Tenda, EDiMAX, D-Link, and Western Digital, among others.  KCodes&nbsp; NetUSB &nbsp;is a Linux kernel module that enables devices on a local network to provide USB-based services over IP. Printers, external hard drives, and flash drives plugged into a Linux-based embedded system (e.g., a router) are made available via the network using the driver.   CVE-2021-45608 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), as the security flaw is tracked as, relates to a&nbsp; buffer overflow vulnerability &nbsp;that, if successfully exploited, can allow attackers to execute code remotely in the kernel and perform malicious activities of their choice, according to a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared by SentinelOne with The Hacker News.  This is the latest in a string of NetUSB vulnerabilities that has been patched in recent years. In May 2015, researchers from SEC Consult disclosed another

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Monday disclosed details of a recently patched security vulnerability in Apple's macOS operating system that could be weaponized by a threat actor to expose users' personal information.  Tracked as CVE-2021-30970, the flaw concerns a logic issue in the Transparency, Consent and Control (TCC) security framework, which enables users to configure the privacy settings of their apps and provide access to protected files and app data. The&nbsp; Security &amp; Privacy pane &nbsp;in the macOS System Preferences app serves as the front end of TCC.  Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team, which reported the vulnerability to Apple on July 15, 2021, dubbed the flaw " powerdir ." Apple&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;the issue as part of macOS 11.6 and 12.1 updates released in December 2021 with improved state management.   While Apple does enforce a policy that limits access to TCC to only apps with full disk access, it's possible to orchestrate an attack wherein a malicious application could

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A study of 16 different Uniform Resource Locator ( URL ) parsing libraries has unearthed inconsistencies and confusions that could be exploited to bypass validations and open the door to a wide range of attack vectors.  In a deep-dive analysis jointly conducted by cybersecurity firms Claroty &nbsp; and Synk, eight security vulnerabilities were identified in as many third-party libraries written in C, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby languages and used by several web applications.  "The confusion in URL parsing can cause unexpected behavior in the software (e.g., web application), and could be exploited by threat actors to cause denial-of-service conditions, information leaks, or possibly conduct remote code execution attacks," the researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  With URLs being a fundamental mechanism by which resources — located either locally or on the web — can be requested and retrieved, differences in how the parsing libraries interpret a URL requ

Log4Shell-like Critical RCE Flaw Discovered in H2 Database Console<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/log4shell-like-critical-rce-flaw.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed a security flaw affecting H2 database consoles that could result in remote code execution in a manner that echoes the Log4j "Log4Shell" vulnerability that came to light last month.  The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-42392 , is the " first critical issue published since Log4Shell, on a component other than Log4j, that exploits the same root cause of the Log4Shell vulnerability, namely JNDI remote class loading," JFrog researchers Andrey Polkovnychenko and Shachar Menashe&nbsp; said .   H2 &nbsp;is an open-source relational database management system written in Java that can be embedded within applications or run in a client-server mode. According to the&nbsp; Maven Repository , the H2 database engine is used by 6,807 artifacts.  JNDI, short for Java Naming and Directory Interface, refers to an API that provides naming and directory functionality for Java applications, which can use the API in conjunction with LDAP to locate a specific resource that it migh

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMWare has shipped updates to Workstation, Fusion, and ESXi products to address an "important" security vulnerability that could be weaponized by a threat actor to take control of affected systems.  The issue relates to a heap-overflow vulnerability — tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-22045 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.7) — that, if successfully exploited, results in the execution of arbitrary code. The company credited Jaanus Kääp, a security researcher with Clarified Security, for reporting the flaw.   "A malicious actor with access to a virtual machine with CD-ROM device emulation may be able to exploit this vulnerability in conjunction with other issues to execute code on the hypervisor from a virtual machine," VMware&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published on January 4.   The error affects ESXi versions 6.5, 6.7, and 7.0; Workstation versions 16.x; and Fusion versions 12.x, with the company yet to release a patch for ESXi 7.0. In the interim, the company is&nbsp; recommending &nbsp;users to disable all

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has rolled out the first round of updates to its Chrome web browser for 2022 to fix 37 security issues, one of which is rated Critical in severity and could be exploited to pass arbitrary code and gain control over a victim's system.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-0096 , the flaw relates to a&nbsp; use-after-free bug &nbsp;in the Storage component, which could have devastating effects ranging from corruption of valid data to the execution of malicious code on a compromised machine.   Security researcher Yangkang ( @dnpushme ) of Qihoo 360 ATA, who has previously disclosed&nbsp; zero-day vulnerabilities &nbsp;in Apple's WebKit, has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on November 30, 2021.   It's also worth pointing out that 24 of the 37 uncovered flaws came from external researchers, including its Google Project Zero initiative, while the others were flagged as part of its ongoing internal security work. Of the 24 bugs, 10 are rated High, another 10 are rated Medium, and three

SAILFISH System to Find State-Inconsistency Bugs in Smart Contracts<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/sailfish-system-to-find-state.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics from the University of California, Santa Barbara, has demonstrated what it calls a "scalable technique" to vet smart contracts and mitigate state-inconsistency bugs, discovering 47 zero-day vulnerabilities on the Ethereum blockchain in the process.  Smart contracts are&nbsp; programs &nbsp;stored on the blockchain that are automatically executed when predetermined conditions are met based on the encoded terms of the agreement. They allow trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out between anonymous parties without the need for a central authority.  In other words, the code itself is meant to be the final arbiter of "the deal" it represents, with the program controlling all aspects of the execution, and providing an immutable evidentiary audit trail of transactions that are both trackable and irreversible.   This also means that vulnerabilities in the code could result in hefty losses, as evidenced by hacks aimed at&nbsp; the DAO &nbsp;and more recently,

Researchers Detail New HomeKit 'doorLock' Bug Affecting Apple iOS<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/researchers-detail-new-homekit-doorlock.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A persistent denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability has been discovered in Apple's iOS mobile operating system that's capable of sending affected devices into a crash or reboot loop upon connecting to an Apple Home-compatible appliance.  The behavior, dubbed "doorLock," is trivial in that it can be triggered by simply changing the name of a HomeKit device to a string larger than 500,000 characters.  This causes an iPhone or iPad that attempts to connect to the device to become unresponsive and enter an indefinite cycle of system failure and restart that can only be mitigated by restoring the affected device from Recovery or DFU (Device Firmware Update) Mode.   HomeKit &nbsp;is Apple's software framework that allows iOS and iPadOS users to configure, communicate with, and control connected accessories and smart-home appliances using Apple devices.  "Any device with an affected iOS version installed that loads the string will be disrupted, even after rebooting,"

Microsoft, over the weekend, rolled out a fix to address an issue that caused email messages to get stuck on its Exchange Server platforms due to what it blamed on a date validation error at around the turn of the year.  "The problem relates to a date check failure with the change of the new year and it [is] not a failure of the [antivirus] engine itself," the company &nbsp;said &nbsp;in a blog post. "This is not an issue with malware scanning or the malware engine, and it is not a security-related issue. The version checking performed against the signature file is causing the malware engine to crash, resulting in messages being stuck in transport queues."   The Windows maker said the issue impacted on-premises versions of Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019 but didn't specify how widespread the impact was.  The issue began to&nbsp; gain &nbsp; attention &nbsp;as the year 2022 kicked in, causing the servers to no longer deliver email messages while throwing the following erro

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) on Tuesday rolled out fresh patches to contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in Log4j that could be abused by threat actors to run malicious code on affected systems, making it the fifth security shortcoming to be discovered in the tool in the span of a month.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-44832 , the vulnerability is rated 6.6 in severity on a scale of 10 and impacts all versions of the logging library from 2.0-alpha7 to 2.17.0 with the exception of 2.3.2 and 2.12.4. While Log4j versions 1.x are not affected, users are recommended to upgrade to Log4j 2.3.2 (for Java 6), 2.12.4 (for Java 7), or 2.17.1 (for Java 8 and later).  "Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack where an attacker with permission to modify the logging configuration file can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JND

Garrett Walk-Through Metal Detectors Can Be Hacked Remotely<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/garrett-walk-through-metal-detectors.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A number of security flaws have been uncovered in a networking component in Garrett Metal Detectors that could allow remote attackers to bypass authentication requirements, tamper with metal detector configurations, and even execute arbitrary code on the devices.  "An attacker could manipulate this module to remotely monitor statistics on the metal detector, such as whether the alarm has been triggered or how many visitors have walked through," Cisco Talos &nbsp;noted &nbsp;in a disclosure publicized last week. "They could also make configuration changes, such as altering the sensitivity level of a device, which potentially poses a security risk to users who rely on these metal detectors."  Talos security researcher Matt Wiseman has been credited with discovering and reporting these vulnerabilities on August 17, 2021. Patches have been released by the vendor on December 13, 2021.   The flaws reside in Garrett &nbsp;iC Module , which enables users to communicate to walk-through me

A short-lived phishing campaign has been observed taking advantage of a novel exploit that bypassed a patch put in place by Microsoft to fix a remote code execution vulnerability affecting the MSHTML component with the goal of delivering Formbook malware.  "The attachments represent an escalation of the attacker's abuse of the CVE-2021-40444 bug and demonstrate that even a patch can't always mitigate the actions of a motivated and sufficiently skilled attacker," SophosLabs researchers Andrew Brandt and Stephen Ormandy&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published Tuesday.  CVE-2021-40444 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8) relates to a remote code execution flaw in MSHTML that could be exploited using specially crafted Microsoft Office documents. Although Microsoft addressed the security weakness as part of its September 2021&nbsp; Patch Tuesday updates , it has been put to use in&nbsp; multiple attacks &nbsp;ever since details pertaining to the flaw became public.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is urging customers to patch two security vulnerabilities in Active Directory domain controllers that it&nbsp; addressed in November &nbsp;following the availability of a proof-of-concept (PoC) tool on December 12.  The two vulnerabilities — tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-42278 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2021-42287 &nbsp;— have a severity rating of 7.5 out of a maximum of 10 and concern a privilege escalation flaw affecting the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) component. Credited with discovering and reporting both the bugs is Andrew Bartlett of Catalyst IT.   Active Directory is a&nbsp; directory service &nbsp;that runs on Microsoft Windows Server and is used for identity and access management. Although the tech giant marked the shortcomings as " exploitation Less Likely " in its assessment, the public disclosure of the PoC has prompted renewed calls for applying the fixes to mitigate any potential exploitation by threat actors.

New Mobile Network Vulnerabilities Affect All Cellular Generations Since 2G<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/new-mobile-network-vulnerabilities.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed security vulnerabilities in handover, a fundamental mechanism that undergirds modern cellular networks, which could be exploited by adversaries to launch denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks using low-cost equipment.  The "vulnerabilities in the handover procedure are not limited to one handover case only but they impact all different handover cases and scenarios that are based on unverified measurement reports and signal strength thresholds," researchers Evangelos Bitsikas and Christina Pöpper from the New York University Abu Dhabi said in a&nbsp; new paper . "The problem affects all generations since 2G (GSM), remaining unsolved so far."  Handover , also known as handoff, is a process in telecommunications in which a phone call or a data session is transferred from one&nbsp; cell site &nbsp;(aka base station) to another cell tower without losing connectivity during the transmission. This method is crucial to establishing cellul

Experts Discover Backdoor Deployed on the U.S. Federal Agency's Network<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/experts-discover-backdoor-deployed-on.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A U.S. federal government commission associated with international rights has been targeted by a backdoor that reportedly compromised its internal network in what the researchers described as a "classic APT-type operation."&nbsp;  "This attack could have given total visibility of the network and complete control of a system and thus could be used as the first step in a multi-stage attack to penetrate this, or other networks more deeply," Czech security company Avast&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.   The name of the federal entity was not disclosed, but reports from&nbsp; Ars Technica &nbsp;and&nbsp; The Record &nbsp;tied it to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom ( USCIRF ). Avast said it was making its findings public after unsuccessful attempts to directly notify the agency about the intrusion and through other channels put in place by the U.S. government.  At this stage, only "parts of the attack puzzle" have been uncovered, leaving the door open for

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered an entirely new attack vector that enables adversaries to exploit the Log4Shell vulnerability on servers locally by using a JavaScript WebSocket connection.  "This newly-discovered attack vector means that anyone with a vulnerable Log4j version on their machine or local private network can browse a website and potentially trigger the vulnerability," Matthew Warner, CTO of Blumira,&nbsp; said . "At this point, there is no proof of active exploitation. This vector significantly expands the attack surface and can impact services even running as localhost which were not exposed to any network."  WebSockets &nbsp;allow for two-way communications between a web browser (or other client application) and a server, unlike HTTP, which is unidirectional where the client sends the request and the server sends the response.  While the issue can be resolved by updating all local development and internet-facing environments to Log4j 2.16.0, Apache o

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The issues with Log4j continued to stack up as the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) on Friday rolled out yet another patch — version 2.17.0 — for the widely used logging library that could be exploited by malicious actors to stage a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-45105 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5), the new vulnerability affects all versions of the tool from 2.0-beta9 to 2.16.0, which the open-source nonprofit shipped earlier this week to remediate a second flaw that could result in remote code execution ( CVE-2021-45046 ), which, in turn, stemmed from an "incomplete" fix for&nbsp; CVE-2021-44228 , otherwise called the Log4Shell vulnerability.   "Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups," the ASF&nbsp; explained &nbsp;in a revised advisory.

Cybersecurity researchers have demonstrated a new attack technique that makes it possible to leverage a device's Bluetooth component to directly extract network passwords and manipulate traffic on a Wi-Fi chip.  The novel attacks work against the so-called "combo chips," which are specialized chips that are equipped to handle different types of radio wave-based wireless communications, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and LTE.  "We provide empirical evidence that coexistence, i.e., the coordination of cross-technology wireless transmissions, is an unexplored attack surface," a group of researchers from the Technical University of Darmstadt's Secure Mobile Networking Lab and the University of Brescia said in a&nbsp; new paper .  "Instead of escalating directly into the mobile [operating system], wireless chips can escalate their privileges into other wireless chips by exploiting the same mechanisms they use to arbitrate their access to the resources they share, i.e

Apple on Monday released updates to&nbsp; iOS ,&nbsp; macOS ,&nbsp; tvOS , and&nbsp; watchOS &nbsp;with security patches for multiple vulnerabilities, including a remote jailbreak exploit chain as well as a number of critical issues in the Kernel and Safari web browser that were first demonstrated at the Tianfu Cup held in China two months ago.  Tracked as CVE-2021-30955, the issue could have enabled a malicious application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. Apple said it addressed the issue with "improved state handling." The flaw also impacts macOS devices.  "The kernel bug CVE-2021-30955 is the one we tried [to] use to build our remote jailbreak chain but failed to complete on time," Kunlun Lab's chief executive, @mj0011sec,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a tweet. A set of kernel vulnerabilities were eventually harnessed by the Pangu Team at the&nbsp; Tianfu hacking contest &nbsp;to break into an iPhone13 Pro running iOS 15, a feat that netted the white hat hackers $330,000 in cash rewards.

Google has rolled out fixes for five security vulnerabilities in its Chrome web browser, including one which it says is being exploited in the wild, making it the&nbsp; 17th such weakness &nbsp;to be disclosed since the start of the year.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-4102 , the flaw relates to a&nbsp; use-after-free bug &nbsp;in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, which could have severe consequences ranging from corruption of valid data to the execution of arbitrary code. An anonymous researcher has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw.  As it stands, it's not known how the weakness is being abused in real-world attacks, but the internet giant issued a terse statement that said, "it's aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2021-4102 exists in the wild." This is done so in an attempt to ensure that a majority of users are updated with a fix and prevent further exploitation by other threat actors.

Threat actors are actively weaponizing  unpatched servers affected by the newly identified " Log4Shell " vulnerability in Log4j to install cryptocurrency miners, Cobalt Strike, and recruit the devices into a botnet, even as telemetry signs point to exploitation of the flaw nine days before it even came to light.  Netlab, the networking security division of Chinese tech giant Qihoo 360,&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;threats such as&nbsp; Mirai &nbsp;and&nbsp; Muhstik &nbsp;(aka Tsunami) are setting their sights on vulnerable systems to spread the infection and grow its computing power to orchestrate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks with the goal of overwhelming a target and rendering it unusable. Muhstik was previously spotted exploiting a critical security flaw in Atlassian Confluence ( CVE-2021-26084 , CVSS score: 9.8) earlier this September.   The latest development comes as it has emerged that the vulnerability has been under attack for at least more than a week prior to its public disclosure on D

At least 300,000 IP addresses associated with MikroTik devices have been found vulnerable to multiple remotely exploitable security vulnerabilities that have since been patched by the popular supplier of routers and wireless ISP devices.  The most affected devices are located in China, Brazil, Russia, Italy, Indonesia, with the U.S. coming in at number eight, cybersecurity firm Eclypsium said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "These devices are both powerful, [and] often highly vulnerable," the researchers&nbsp; noted . "This has made MikroTik devices a favorite among threat actors who have commandeered the devices for everything from DDoS attacks, command-and-control (aka 'C2'), traffic tunneling, and more."  MikroTik devices are an enticing target not least because there are more than two million of them deployed worldwide, posing a huge attack surface that can be leveraged by threat actors to mount an array of intrusions.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have discovered 14 new types of cross-site data leakage attacks against a number of modern web browsers, including Tor Browser, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, and Opera, among others.  Collectively known as "XS-Leaks," the browser bugs enable a malicious website to harvest personal data from its visitors as they interact with other websites in the background without the targets' knowledge. The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;are the result of a comprehensive study of cross-site attacks undertaken by a group of academics from Ruhr-Universität Bochum (RUB) and Niederrhein University.  "XS-Leaks bypass the so-called&nbsp; same-origin policy , one of a browser's main defences against various types of attacks," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. "The purpose of the same-origin policy is to prevent information from being stolen from a trusted website. In the case of XS-Leaks, attackers can nevertheless recognize individual, small details

Mozilla has rolled out fixes to address a critical security weakness in its cross-platform Network Security Services ( NSS ) cryptographic library that could be potentially exploited by an adversary to crash a vulnerable application and even execute arbitrary code.  Tracked as CVE-2021-43527, the flaw affects NSS versions prior to 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR, and concerns a&nbsp; heap overflow &nbsp;vulnerability when verifying digital signatures such as&nbsp; DSA &nbsp;and&nbsp; RSA-PSS &nbsp;algorithms that are encoded using the&nbsp; DER &nbsp;binary format.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Unofficial patches have been issued to remediate an improperly patched Windows security vulnerability that could allow information disclosure and local privilege escalation (LPE) on vulnerable systems.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-24084 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 5.5), the flaw concerns an information disclosure vulnerability in the Windows Mobile Device Management component that could enable an attacker to gain unauthorized file system access and read arbitrary files.  Security researcher Abdelhamid Naceri was credited with discovering and reporting the bug in October 2020, prompting Microsoft to address the issue as part of its February 2021 Patch Tuesday updates.   But as&nbsp; observed &nbsp;by Naceri in June 2021, not only could the patch be bypassed to achieve the same objective, the researcher this month found that the incompletely patched vulnerability could also be&nbsp; exploited &nbsp;to gain administrator privileges and run malicious code on Windows 10 machines running the&nbsp; latest security updates .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware has shipped updates to address two security vulnerabilities in vCenter Server and Cloud Foundation that could be abused by a remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.  The more severe of the issues concerns an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the vSphere Web Client. Tracked as CVE-2021-21980, the bug has been rated 7.5 out of a maximum of 10 on the CVSS scoring system, and impacts vCenter Server versions 6.5 and 6.7.  "A malicious actor with network access to port 443 on vCenter Server may exploit this issue to gain access to sensitive information," the company&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in an advisory published on November 23, crediting ch0wn of Orz lab for reporting the flaw.   The second shortcoming remediated by VMware relates to an&nbsp; SSRF &nbsp;(Server-Side Request Forgery) vulnerability in the Virtual storage area network (vSAN) Web Client plug-in that could allow a malicious actor with network access to port 443 on vCenter Server to exploit the flaw by accessing an i

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple security weaknesses have been disclosed in MediaTek system-on-chips (SoCs) that could have enabled a threat actor to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the firmware of the audio processor, effectively allowing the attackers to carry out a "massive eavesdrop campaign" without the users' knowledge.  The discovery of the flaws is the result of reverse-engineering the Taiwanese company's audio digital signal processor ( DSP ) unit by Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point Research, ultimately finding that by stringing them together with other flaws present in a smartphone manufacturer's libraries, the issues uncovered in the chip could lead to local privilege escalation from an Android application.&nbsp;   "A malformed inter-processor message could potentially be used by an attacker to execute and hide malicious code inside the DSP firmware," Check Point security researcher Slava Makkaveev&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.

Networking equipment company Netgear has&nbsp; released &nbsp;yet&nbsp; another round &nbsp;of&nbsp; patches &nbsp;to remediate a high-severity remote code execution vulnerability affecting multiple routers that could be exploited by remote attackers to take control of an affected system.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-34991 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), the pre-authentication buffer overflow flaw in small office and home office (SOHO) routers can lead to code execution with the highest privileges by taking advantage of an issue residing in the Universal Plug and Play ( UPnP ) feature that allows devices to discover each other's presence on the same local network and open ports needed to connect to the public Internet.   Because of its ubiquitous nature, UPnP is used by a wide variety of devices, including personal computers, networking equipment, video game consoles and internet of things (IoT) devices.  Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the fact that the UPnP daemon accepts unauthenticated HTTP SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRI

A new zero-day vulnerability has been disclosed in Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect VPN that could be abused by an unauthenticated network-based attacker to execute arbitrary code on affected devices with root user privileges.  Tracked as CVE-2021-3064 (CVSS score: 9.8), the security weakness impacts PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.17. Massachusetts-based cybersecurity firm Randori has been credited with discovering and reporting the issue.   "The vulnerability chain consists of a method for bypassing validations made by an external web server (HTTP smuggling) and a stack-based buffer overflow," Randori researchers&nbsp; said . "Exploitation of the vulnerability chain has been proven and allows for remote code execution on both physical and virtual firewall products."  Technical details related to CVE-2021-3064 have been withheld for 30 days to prevent threat actors from abusing the vulnerability to stage real-world attacks.   The security bug stems from a b

13 New Flaws in Siemens Nucleus TCP/IP Stack Impact Safety-Critical Equipment<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/13-new-flaws-in-siemens-nucleus-tcpip.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as 13 security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Nucleus TCP/IP stack, a software library now maintained by Siemens and used in three billion operational technology and IoT devices that could allow for remote code execution, denial-of-service (DoS), and information leak.  Collectively called " NUCLEUS:13 ," successful attacks abusing the flaws can "result in devices going offline and having their logic hijacked," and "spread[ing] malware to wherever they communicate on the network," researchers from Forescout and Medigate said in a technical report published Tuesday, with one proof-of-concept (PoC) successfully&nbsp; demonstrating &nbsp;a scenario that could potentially disrupt medical care and critical processes.  Siemens has since released&nbsp; security updates &nbsp;to remediate the weaknesses in Nucleus ReadyStart versions 3 (v2017.02.4 or later) and 4 (v4.1.1 or later).   Primarily deployed in automotive, industrial, and medical applications, Nucleus

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed 14 critical vulnerabilities in the BusyBox Linux utility that could be exploited to result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition and, in select cases, even lead to information leaks and remote code execution.  The security weaknesses, tracked from CVE-2021-42373 through CVE-2021-42386, affect multiple versions of the tool ranging from 1.16-1.33.1, DevOps company JFrog and industrial cybersecurity company Claroty&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a joint report.   Dubbed "the Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux,"&nbsp; BusyBox &nbsp;is a widely used software suite combining a variety of common Unix utilities or applets (e.g.,&nbsp; cp ,&nbsp; ls ,&nbsp; grep ) into a single executable file that can run on Linux systems such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and remote terminal units (RTUs).   A quick list of the flaws and the applets they impact is below —   man &nbsp;- CVE-2021-42373  lzma/unlzma &nbsp;- CVE-2021-42374  ash &nbsp;- CVE-2021-42375  hus

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a security flaw in the Linux Kernel's Transparent Inter Process Communication ( TIPC ) module that could potentially be leveraged both locally as well as remotely to execute arbitrary code within the kernel and take control of vulnerable machines.  The heap overflow vulnerability "can be exploited locally or remotely within a network to gain kernel privileges, and would allow an attacker to compromise the entire system," cybersecurity firm SentinelOne&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today and shared with The Hacker News.   TIPC is a transport layer&nbsp; protocol &nbsp; designed &nbsp;for nodes running in dynamic cluster environments to reliably communicate with each other in a manner that's more efficient and fault-tolerant than other protocols such as TCP. The vulnerability identified by SentinelOne has to do with a new message type called " MSG_CRYPTO " that was introduced in September 2020 and enables peer nodes in the cluster to

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has rolled out its monthly security patches for Android with fixes for 39 flaws, including a zero-day vulnerability that it said is being actively exploited in the wild in limited, targeted attacks.  Tracked as CVE-2021-1048 , the zero-day bug is described as a&nbsp; use-after-free vulnerability &nbsp;in the kernel that can be exploited for local privilege escalation. Use-after-free issues are dangerous as it could enable a threat actor to access or referencing memory after it has been freed, leading to a " write-what-where " condition that results in the execution of arbitrary code to gain control over a victim's system.   "There are indications that CVE-2021-1048 may be under limited, targeted exploitation," the company&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in its November advisory without revealing technical details of the vulnerability, the nature of the intrusions, and the identities of the attackers that may have abused the flaw.

A now-patched critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in GitLab's web interface has been detected as actively exploited in the wild, cybersecurity researchers warn, rendering a large number of internet-facing GitLab instances susceptible to attacks.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-22205 , the issue relates to an improper validation of user-provided images that results in arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability, which affects all versions starting from 11.9, has since been&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;by GitLab on April 14, 2021 in versions 13.8.8, 13.9.6, and 13.10.3.   In one of the real-world attacks&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;by HN Security last month, two user accounts with admin privileges were registered on a publicly-accessible GitLab server belonging to an unnamed customer by exploiting the aforementioned flaw to upload a malicious payload that leads to remote execution of arbitrary commands, including obtaining elevated permissions.

Microsoft on Thursday disclosed details of a new vulnerability that could allow an attacker to bypass security restrictions in macOS and take complete control of the device to perform arbitrary operations on the device without getting flagged by traditional security solutions.  Dubbed " Shrootless " and tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-30892 , the "vulnerability lies in how Apple-signed packages with post-install scripts are installed," Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team's Jonathan Bar Or&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up. "A malicious actor could create a specially crafted file that would hijack the installation process."   System Integrity Protection ( SIP ) aka "rootless" is a&nbsp; security feature &nbsp;introduced in OS X El Capitan that's designed to protect the macOS operating system by restricting a&nbsp; root user &nbsp;from executing unauthorized code or performing operations that may compromise system integrity.  Specifically, SIP allows modification of prote

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A "potentially devastating and hard-to-detect threat" could be abused by attackers to collect users' browser fingerprinting information with the goal of spoofing the victims without their knowledge, thus effectively compromising their privacy.  Academics from Texas A&amp;M University dubbed the attack system " Gummy Browsers ," likening it to a nearly 20-year-old " Gummy Fingers " technique that can impersonate a user's fingerprint biometrics.&nbsp;   "The idea is that the attacker 𝐴 first makes the user 𝑈 connect to his website (or to a well-known site the attacker controls) and transparently collects the information from 𝑈 that is used for fingerprinting purposes (just like any fingerprinting website 𝑊 collects this information)," the researchers outlined. "Then, 𝐴 orchestrates a browser on his own machine to replicate and transmit the same fingerprinting information when connecting to 𝑊, fooling 𝑊 to think that 𝑈 is the one re

A new security weakness has been disclosed in the WinRAR trialware file archiver utility for Windows that could be abused by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on targeted systems, underscoring how vulnerabilities in such software could beсome a gateway for a roster of attacks.  Tracked as CVE-2021-35052, the bug impacts the trial version of the software running version 5.70. "This vulnerability allows an attacker to intercept and modify requests sent to the user of the application," Positive Technologies' Igor Sak-Sakovskiy&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up.

Microsoft has published a new advisory warning of a security bypass vulnerability affecting Surface Pro 3 convertible laptops that could be exploited by an adversary to introduce malicious devices within enterprise networks and defeat the device attestation mechanism.

Critical Remote Hacking Flaws Disclosed in Linphone and MicroSIP Softphones<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/critical-remote-hacking-flaws-disclosed.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in softphone software from Linphone and MicroSIP that could be exploited by an unauthenticated remote adversary to crash the client and even extract sensitive information like password hashes by simply making a malicious call.  The vulnerabilities, which were discovered by Moritz Abrell of German pen-testing firm SySS GmbH, have since been addressed by the respective manufacturers following responsible disclosure.  Softphones are essentially software-based phones that mimic desk phones and allow for making telephone calls over the Internet without the need for using dedicated hardware. At the core of the issues are the SIP services offered by the clients to connect two peers to facilitate telephony services in IP-based mobile networks.   SIP aka Session Initiation Protocol is a&nbsp; signaling protocol &nbsp;that's used to control interactive communication sessions, such as voice, video, chat and instant messaging, as well as games and v

Experts Warn of Unprotected Prometheus Endpoints Exposing Sensitive Information<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/experts-warn-of-unprotected-prometheus.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A large-scale unauthenticated scraping of publicly available and non-secured endpoints from older versions of Prometheus event monitoring and alerting solution could be leveraged to inadvertently leak sensitive information, according to the latest research.  "Due to the fact that authentication and encryption support is relatively new, many organizations that use Prometheus haven't yet enabled these features and thus many Prometheus endpoints are completely exposed to the Internet (e.g. endpoints that run earlier versions), leaking metric and label dat," JFrog researchers Andrey Polkovnychenko and Shachar Menashe&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.  Prometheus &nbsp;is an open-source system monitoring and alerting toolkit used to collect and process metrics from different endpoints, alongside enabling easy observation of software metrics such as memory usage, network usage, and software-specific defined metrics, such as the number of failed logins to a web application.

Critical Flaw in OpenSea Could Have Let Hackers Steal Cryptocurrency From Wallets<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/critical-flaw-in-opensea-could-have-let.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-patched critical vulnerability in OpenSea, the world's largest non-fungible token ( NFT ) marketplace, could've been abused by malicious actors to drain cryptocurrency funds from a victim by sending a specially-crafted token, opening a new attack vector for exploitation.  The findings come from cybersecurity firm Check Point Research, which began an investigation into the platform following public reports of stolen cryptocurrency wallets triggered by free airdropped NFTs. The issues were fixed in less than one hour of responsible disclosure on September 26, 2021.   "Left unpatched, the vulnerabilities could allow hackers to hijack user accounts and steal entire cryptocurrency wallets by crafting malicious NFTs," Check Point researchers&nbsp; said .  As the name indicates, NFTs are unique digital assets such as photos, videos, audio, and other items that can be sold and traded on the blockchain, using the technology as a certificate of authenticity to establish a ver

GitHub Revoked Insecure SSH Keys Generated by a Popular git Client<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/github-revoked-insecure-ssh-keys.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Code hosting platform GitHub has&nbsp; revoked &nbsp;weak SSH authentication keys that were generated via the GitKraken git GUI client due to a vulnerability in a third-party library that increased the likelihood of duplicated SSH keys.  As an added precautionary measure, the Microsoft-owned company also said it's building safeguards to prevent vulnerable versions of GitKraken from adding newly generated weak keys.   The problematic dependency, called " keypair ," is an open-source SSH key generation library that allows users to create RSA keys for authentication-related purposes. It has been found to impact&nbsp; GitKraken &nbsp;versions 7.6.x, 7.7.x, and 8.0.0, released between May 12, 2021, and September 27, 2021.  The flaw — tracked as CVE-2021-41117  (CVSS score: 8.7) — concerns  a bug in the pseudo-random number generator used by the library, resulting in the creation of a weaker form of public SSH keys, which, owing to their low entropy — i.e., the measure of randomness — could boost

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Apache Software Foundation on Thursday released additional security updates for its HTTP Server product to remediate what it says is an "incomplete fix" for an&nbsp; actively exploited &nbsp;path traversal and remote code execution flaw that it patched earlier this week.  CVE-2021-42013 , as the new vulnerability is identified as, builds upon&nbsp; CVE-2021-41773 , a flaw that impacted Apache web servers running version 2.4.49 and involved a&nbsp; path normalization &nbsp;bug that could enable an adversary to access and view arbitrary files stored on a vulnerable server.   Although the flaw was addressed by the maintainers in version 2.4.50, a day after the patches were released it became known that the weakness could also be abused to gain remote code execution if the "mod_cgi" module was loaded and the configuration "require all denied" was absent, prompting Apache to issue another round of emergency updates.   "It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HT

Code Execution Bug Affects Yamale Python Package — Used by Over 200 Projects<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/code-execution-bug-affects-yamale.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A high-severity code injection vulnerability has been disclosed in 23andMe's Yamale, a schema and validator for YAML, that could be trivially exploited by adversaries to execute arbitrary Python code.  The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-38305 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), involves manipulating the schema file provided as input to the tool to circumvent protections and achieve code execution. Particularly, the&nbsp; issue &nbsp;resides in the schema parsing function, which allows any input passed to be evaluated and executed, resulting in a scenario where a specially-crafted string within the schema can be abused for the injection of system commands.   Yamale is a Python package that allows developers to validate YAML — a data serialization language often used for writing configuration files — from the command line. The package is used by at least&nbsp; 224 repositories &nbsp;on GitHub.&nbsp;  "This gap allows attackers that can provide an input schema file to perform Python code injection that leads to code execut

Apache has issued patches to address two security vulnerabilities, including a path traversal and file disclosure flaw in its HTTP server that it said is being actively exploited in the wild.

An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the expected document root," the open-source project maintainers&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in an advisory published Tuesday.  "If files outside of the document root are not protected by 'require all denied' these requests can succeed. Additionally this flaw could leak the source of interpreted files like CGI scripts."   The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-41773 , affects only Apache HTTP server version 2.4.49.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly discovered data exfiltration mechanism employs Ethernet cables as a "transmitting antenna" to stealthily siphon highly-sensitive data from air-gapped systems, according to the latest research.  "It's interesting that the wires that came to protect the air-gap become the vulnerability of the air gap in this attack," Dr. Mordechai Guri, the head of R&amp;D in the Cyber Security Research Center in the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, told The Hacker News.  Dubbed " LANtenna Attack ," the novel technique enables malicious code in air-gapped computers to amass sensitive data and then encode it over radio waves emanating from Ethernet cables just as if they are antennas. The transmitted signals can then be intercepted by a nearby software-defined radio (SDR) receiver wirelessly, decode the data, and send it to an attacker who is in an adjacent room.  "Notably, the malicious code can run in an ordinary user-mode process and successf

Google on Thursday pushed urgent security fixes for its Chrome browser, including a pair of two new security weaknesses that the company said are being exploited in the wild, making them the fourth and fifth actively zero-days plugged this month alone.  The issues, designed as&nbsp; CVE-2021-37975 and CVE-2021-37976 , are part of a total of four patches, and concern a&nbsp; use-after-free flaw &nbsp;in V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine as well as an information leak in core.  As is usually the case, the tech giant has refrained from sharing any additional details regarding how these zero-day vulnerabilities were used in attacks until a majority of users are updated with the patches, but noted that it's aware that "exploits for CVE-2021-37975 and CVE-2021-37976 exist in the wild."   An anonymous researcher has been credited with reporting CVE-2021-37975. The discovery of CVE-2021-37976, on the other hand, involves Clément Lecigne from Google Threat Analysis Group, who was also credit

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed an unpatched security vulnerability in the protocol used by Microsoft Azure Active Directory that potential adversaries could abuse to stage undetected brute-force attacks.  "This flaw allows threat actors to perform single-factor brute-force attacks against Azure Active Directory ( Azure AD ) without generating sign-in events in the targeted organization's tenant," researchers from Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published on Wednesday.   Azure Active Directory is Microsoft's enterprise cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) solution designed for single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication. It's also a core component of Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365), with capabilities to provide authentication to other applications via OAuth.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple on Thursday released security updates to fix multiple security vulnerabilities in older versions of&nbsp; iOS &nbsp;and&nbsp; macOS &nbsp;that it says have been detected in exploits in the wild, in addition to expanding patches for a previously plugged security weakness abused by NSO Group's Pegasus surveillance tool to target iPhone users.   Chief among them is CVE-2021-30869, a type confusion flaw that resides in the kernel component&nbsp; XNU &nbsp;developed by Apple that could cause a malicious application to execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges. The Cupertino-based tech giant said it addressed the bug with improved state handling.  Google's Threat Analysis Group, which is credited with reporting the flaw, said  it detected the vulnerability being "used in conjunction with a N-day remote code execution targeting WebKit."  Two other flaws include&nbsp; CVE-2021-30858 and CVE-2021-30860 , both of which were resolved by the company earlier this month following disclosure from the

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have disclosed an unpatched weakness in Microsoft Windows Platform Binary Table (WPBT) affecting all Windows-based devices since Windows 8 that could be potentially exploited to install a rootkit and compromise the integrity of devices.  "These flaws make every Windows system vulnerable to easily-crafted attacks that install fraudulent vendor-specific tables," researchers from Eclypsium&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published on Monday. "These tables can be exploited by attackers with direct physical access, with remote access, or through manufacturer supply chains. More importantly, these motherboard-level flaws can obviate initiatives like&nbsp; Secured-core &nbsp;because of the ubiquitous usage of&nbsp; ACPI &nbsp;[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface] and WPBT."   WPBT, introduced with Windows 8 in 2012, is a&nbsp; feature &nbsp;that enables "boot firmware to provide Windows with a platform binary that the operating system can execute."&nbsp;  In other words, it allows

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Over the last several years, there have been numerous high-profile security breaches. These breaches have underscored the fact that traditional cyber defenses have become woefully inadequate and that stronger defenses are needed. As such, many organizations have transitioned toward a zero trust security model.  A zero trust security model is based on the idea that no IT resource should be trusted implicitly. Prior to the introduction of zero trust security, a user who authenticated into a network was trustworthy for the duration of their session, as was the user's device.  In a zero trust model, a user is no longer considered to be trustworthy just because they entered a password at the beginning of their session. Instead, the user's identity is verified through multi-factor authentication, and the user may be prompted to re-authenticate if they attempt to access resources that are particularly sensitive or if the user attempts to do something out of the ordinary.

Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed details of an unpatched vulnerability in macOS Finder that could be abused by remote adversaries to trick users into running arbitrary commands on the machines.

Park Minchan, an independent security researcher, has been credited with reporting the vulnerability which affects macOS versions of Big Sur and prior.   The weakness arises due to the manner macOS processes INETLOC files — shortcuts to internet locations such as RSS feeds or Telnet connections containing username and password for SSH — resulting in a scenario that allows commands embedded in those files to be executed without any warni

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Continuous integration vendor Travis CI has patched a serious security flaw that exposed API keys, access tokens, and credentials, potentially putting organizations that use public source code repositories at risk of further attacks.  The issue — tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-41077 &nbsp;— concerns unauthorized access and plunder of secret environment data associated with a public open-source project during the software build process. The problem is said to have lasted during an eight-day window between September 3 and September 10.  Felix Lange of Ethereum has been credited with discovering the leakage on September 7, with the company's Péter Szilágyi&nbsp; pointing out &nbsp;that "anyone could exfiltrate these and gain lateral movement into 1000s of [organizations]."   Travis CI is a hosted CI/CD (short for continuous integration and continuous deployment) solution used to build and test software projects hosted on source code repository systems like GitHub and Bitbucket.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New details have been revealed about a recently remediated critical vulnerability in Netgear smart switches that could be leveraged by an attacker to potentially execute malicious code and take control of vulnerable devices.  The flaw — dubbed " Seventh Inferno " (CVSS score: 9.8) — is part of a trio of security weaknesses, called Demon's Cries (CVSS score: 9.8) and Draconian Fear (CVSS score: 7.8), that Google security engineer Gynvael Coldwind reported to the networking, storage, and security solutions provider.  The disclosure comes weeks after Netgear&nbsp; released patches &nbsp;to address the vulnerabilities earlier this month, on September 3.   Successful exploitation of&nbsp; Demon's Cries and Draconian Fear &nbsp;could grant a malicious party the ability to change the administrator password without actually having to know the previous password or hijack the session bootstrapping information, resulting in a full compromise of the device.

Microsoft on Wednesday disclosed details of a targeted phishing campaign that leveraged a now-patched zero-day flaw in its MSHTML platform using specially-crafted Office documents to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon on compromised Windows systems.

"These loaders communicated with an infrastructure that Microsoft associates with multiple cybercriminal campaigns, including human-operated ransomware."   Details about CVE-2021-40444 (CVSS score: 8.8) first&nbsp; emerged &nbsp;on September 7 after researchers from EXPMON alerted the Windows maker about a "highly sophisticated zero-day attack" aimed at Microsoft Office users by taking advantage of a remote code execution vulnerability in MSHTML (aka Trident), a proprietary browser engine for the now

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed details about a high-severity flaw in the HP OMEN driver software that impacts millions of gaming computers worldwide, leaving them open to an array of attacks.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-3437 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), the vulnerabilities could allow threat actors to escalate privileges to kernel mode without requiring administrator permissions, allowing them to disable security products, overwrite system components, and even corrupt the operating system.  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, which discovered and reported the shortcoming to HP on February 17, said it found no evidence of in-the-wild exploitation. The computer hardware company has since released a security update  to its customers to address these vulnerabilities.  The issues themselves are rooted in a component called&nbsp; OMEN Command Center &nbsp;that comes pre-installed on HP OMEN-branded laptops and desktops and can also be downloaded from the Microsoft Store. The software, in addition to mon

A widely used NPM package called ' Pac-Resolver ' for the JavaScript programming language has been remediated with a fix for a high-severity remote code execution vulnerability that could be abused to run malicious code inside Node.js applications whenever HTTP requests are sent.&nbsp;  The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-23406 , has a severity rating of 8.1 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system and affects Pac-Resolver versions before 5.0.0.   A Proxy Auto-Configuration ( PAC ) file is a JavaScript function that determines whether web browser requests should be routed directly to the destination or forwarded to a web proxy server for a given hostname. PAC files are how proxy rules are distributed in enterprise environments.  "This package is used for PAC file support in&nbsp; Pac-Proxy-Agent , which is used in turn in&nbsp; Proxy-Agent , which then used all over the place as the standard go-to package for HTTP proxy auto-detection and configuration in Node.js," Tim Perry&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a

HAProxy Found Vulnerable to Critical HTTP Request Smuggling Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/haproxy-found-vulnerable-to-critical.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical security vulnerability has been disclosed in&nbsp; HAProxy , a widely used open-source load balancer and proxy server, that could be abused by an adversary to possibly smuggle HTTP requests, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data and execution of arbitrary commands, effectively opening the door to an array of attacks.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-40346 , the Integer Overflow vulnerability has a severity rating of 8.6 on the CVSS scoring system and has been rectified in HAProxy versions 2.0.25, 2.2.17, 2.3.14 and 2.4.4.  HTTP Request Smuggling, as the name implies, is a web application attack that tampers the manner a website processes sequences of HTTP requests received from more than one user. Also called HTTP desynchronization, the technique takes advantage of parsing inconsistencies in how front-end servers and back-end servers process requests from the senders.   Front-end servers are typically load balancers or reverse proxies that are used by websites to manage a chai

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The maintainers of Jenkins—a popular open-source automation server software—have disclosed a security breach after unidentified threat actors gained access to one of their servers by exploiting a recently disclosed vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence service to install a cryptocurrency miner.  The "successful attack," which is believed to have occurred last week, was mounted against its Confluence service that had been deprecated since October 2019, leading the team to take the server offline, rotate privileged credentials, and reset passwords for developer accounts.  "At this time we have no reason to believe that any Jenkins releases, plugins, or source code have been affected," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement published over the weekend.   The disclosure comes as the U.S. Cyber Command&nbsp; warned &nbsp;of ongoing mass exploitation attempts in the wild targeting a now-patched critical security vulnerability affecting Atlassian Confluence deployments.

Cisco has patched a critical security vulnerability impacting its Enterprise Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) that could be exploited by an attacker to take control of an affected system.

The network equipment maker said it's aware of a publicly available proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code targeting the vulnerability, but added it's not detected any successful weaponization attempts in the wild.  CVE-2021-34746 issue is caused due to an incomplete validation of user-supplied input that's passed to an authentication script during the sign-in process, enabling an attacker to inject parameters into an authentication request.

A now-patched high-severity security vulnerability in WhatApp's image filter feature could have been abused to send a malicious image over the messaging app to read sensitive information from the app's memory.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2020-1910 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), the flaw concerns an out-of-bounds read/write and stems from applying specific image filters to a rogue image and sending the altered image to an unwitting recipient, thereby enabling an attacker to access valuable data stored the app's memory.   "A missing bounds check in WhatsApp for Android prior to v2.21.1.13 and WhatsApp Business for Android prior to v2.21.1.13 could have allowed out-of-bounds read and write if a user applied specific image filters to a specially-crafted image and sent the resulting image," WhatsApp&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in its advisory published in February 2021.  Cybersecurity firm Check Point  Research, which disclosed the issue to the Facebook-owned platform on November 10, 2020, said it was able to

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed details about a zero-click security vulnerability in Linphone Session Initiation Protocol ( SIP ) stack that could be remotely exploited without any action from a victim to crash the SIP client and cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-33056 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5), the issue concerns a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the " belle-sip " component, a C-language library used to implement SIP transport, transaction, and dialog layers, with all versions prior to&nbsp; 4.5.20 &nbsp;affected by the flaw. The weakness was discovered and reported by industrial cybersecurity company Claroty.   Linphone is an open-source and cross-platform SIP client with support for voice and video calls, end-to-end encrypted messaging, and audio conference calls, among others. SIP, on the other hand, is a signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time multimedia communication sessions for voice, video

Details have emerged about a now-patched security vulnerability impacting Microsoft Exchange Server that could be weaponized by an unauthenticated attacker to modify server configurations, thus leading to the disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-33766 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.3) and coined " ProxyToken ," was discovered by Le Xuan Tuyen, a researcher at the Information Security Center of Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT-ISC), and reported through the Zero-Day Initiative (ZDI) program in March 2021.   "With this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can perform configuration actions on mailboxes belonging to arbitrary users," the ZDI&nbsp; said &nbsp;Monday. "As an illustration of the impact, this can be used to copy all emails addressed to a target and account and forward them to an account controlled by the attacker."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. technology firm Kaseya has&nbsp; released &nbsp;security patches to address two zero-day vulnerabilities affecting its Unitrends enterprise backup and continuity solution that could result in privilege escalation and authenticated remote code execution.  The two weaknesses are part of a&nbsp; trio of vulnerabilities &nbsp;discovered and reported by researchers at the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) on July 3, 2021.   The IT infrastructure management solution provider has addressed the issues in server software version 10.5.5-2 released on August 12, DIVD said. An as-yet-undisclosed client-side vulnerability in Kaseya Unitrends remains unpatched, but the company has published&nbsp; firewall rules &nbsp;that can be applied to filter traffic to and from the client and mitigate any risk associated with the flaw. As an additional precaution, it's&nbsp; recommended &nbsp;not to leave the servers accessible over the internet.  Although specifics related to the vulnerabilities are sparse, the shortcomin

Cloud infrastructure security company Wiz on Thursday revealed details of a now-fixed Azure Cosmos database vulnerability that could have been potentially exploited to grant any Azure user full admin access to other customers' database instances without any authorization.  The flaw, which grants read, write, and delete privileges, has been dubbed " ChaosDB ," with Wiz researchers noting that "the vulnerability has a trivial exploit that doesn't require any previous access to the target environment, and impacts thousands of organizations, including numerous Fortune 500 companies."   Cosmos DB is Microsoft's proprietary&nbsp; NoSQL database &nbsp;that's advertised as "a fully managed service" that "takes database administration off your hands with automatic management, updates and patching."  The Wiz Research Team reported the issue to Microsoft on August 12, after which the Windows maker took steps to mitigate the issue within 48 hours of r

Today I discuss an attack vector conducive to cross-organizational spread, in-home local propagation. Though often overlooked, this vector is especially relevant today, as many corporate employees remain working from home.  In this post, I contrast in-home local propagation with traditional vectors through which a threat (ransomware in particular) spreads throughout an organization. I discuss the reasons this type of spread is problematic for employees and corporations alike. Finally, I offer simple solutions to mitigate the risk of such tactics.&nbsp;  Why Should IT and Security Stakeholders Care?  Today's long cycle attacks are often reconnoitering the victim environment for weeks, if not months. In this time, the attacker gains a tremendous amount of knowledge about systems in the victim's footprint. This additional loiter time in the victim's environment, coupled with ad-hoc maintained work-from-home environments, presents both an&nbsp; ingress avenue &nbsp;for attacks into their net

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco Systems on Wednesday issued patches to address a critical security vulnerability affecting the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) interface used in its Nexus 9000 Series Switches that could be potentially abused to read or write arbitrary files on a vulnerable system.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-1577 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.1), the issue — which is due to improper access control — could enable an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload a file to the appliances. " A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on an affected device," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory.   The APIC appliance is a centralized, clustered controller that programmatically automates network provisioning and control based on the application requirements and policies across physical and virtual environments.  Cisco said it discovered the vulnerability during internal security testing by the Cisco Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG).   Additionally, the

Close to 14 million Linux-based systems are directly exposed to the Internet, making them a lucrative target for an array of real-world attacks that could result in the deployment of malicious web shells, coin miners, ransomware, and other trojans.  That's according to an in-depth look at the Linux threat landscape published by U.S.-Japanese cybersecurity firm Trend Micro , detailing the top threats and vulnerabilities affecting the operating system in the first half of 2021, based on data amassed from honeypots, sensors, and anonymized telemetry.  The company, which detected nearly 15 million malware events aimed at Linux-based cloud environments, found coin miners and ransomware to make up 54% of all malware, with web shells accounting for a 29% share.   In addition, by dissecting over 50 million events reported from 100,000 unique Linux hosts during the same time period, the researchers found 15 different security weaknesses that are known to be actively exploited in the wild o

Critical Flaw Found in Older Cisco Small Business Routers Won't Be Fixed<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/critical-flaw-found-in-older-cisco.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical vulnerability in Cisco Small Business Routers will not be patched by the networking equipment giant, since the devices reached end-of-life in 2019.  Tracked as CVE-2021-34730  (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue resides in the routers' Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) service, enabling an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability, which the company said is due to improper validation of incoming UPnP traffic, could be abused to send a specially-crafted UPnP request to an affected device, resulting in remote code execution as the root user on the underlying operating system.   "Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the vulnerability," the company&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in an advisory published Wednesday. "The Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers have&nbsp; entered the end-of-life process .

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new class of vulnerabilities impacting major DNS-as-a-Service (DNSaaS) providers that could allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive information from corporate networks.

Calling it a "bottomless well of valuable intel," the treasure trove of information contains internal and external IP addresses, computer names, employee names and locations, and details about organizations' web domains. The findings were&nbsp; presented &nbsp;at the Black Hat USA 2021 security conference last week.

A Critical Random Number Generator Flaw Affects Billions of IoT Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/a-critical-random-number-generator-flaw.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical vulnerability has been disclosed in hardware random number generators used in billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices whereby it fails to properly generate random numbers, thus undermining their security and putting them at risk of attacks.  "It turns out that these 'randomly' chosen numbers aren't always as random as you'd like when it comes to IoT devices," Bishop Fox researchers Dan Petro and Allan Cecil&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. "In fact, in many cases, devices are choosing encryption keys of 0 or worse. This can lead to a catastrophic collapse of security for any upstream use."   Random number generation ( RNG ) is a&nbsp; crucial process &nbsp;that undergirds several cryptographic applications, including key generation, nonces, and salting. On traditional operating systems, it's derived from a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) that uses entropy obtained from a high-quality seed source.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Pulse Secure has shipped a fix for a critical post-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in its Connect Secure virtual private network (VPN) appliances to address an incomplete patch for an actively exploited flaw it previously resolved in October 2020.  "The Pulse Connect Secure appliance suffers from an uncontrolled archive extraction vulnerability which allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files, resulting in Remote Code Execution as root," NCC Group's Richard Warren&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;on Friday. "This vulnerability is a bypass of the patch for&nbsp; CVE-2020-8260 ."   "An attacker with such access will be able to circumvent any restrictions enforced via the web application, as well as remount the filesystem, allowing them to create a persistent backdoor, extract and decrypt credentials, compromise VPN clients, or pivot into the internal network," Warren added.  The disclosure comes days after Ivanti, the company behind Pulse Secure,&nbsp; p

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Amazon earlier this April addressed a critical vulnerability in its Kindle e-book reader platform that could have been potentially exploited to take full control over a user's device, resulting in the theft of sensitive information by just deploying a malicious e-book.  "By sending Kindle users a single malicious e-book, a threat actor could have stolen any information stored on the device, from Amazon account credentials to billing information," Yaniv Balmas, head of cyber research at Check Point, said in an emailed statement. "The security vulnerabilities allow an attacker to target a very specific audience."   In other words, if a threat actor wanted to single out a specific group of people or demographic, it's possible for the adversary to choose a popular e-book in a language or dialect that's widely spoken among the group to tailor and orchestrate a highly targeted cyber attack.  Upon responsibly disclosing  the issue to Amazon in February 2021, t

India's Koo, a Twitter-like Service, Found Vulnerable to Critical Worm Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/indias-koo-twitter-like-service-found.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Koo, India's homegrown Twitter clone, recently patched a serious security vulnerability that could have been exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code against hundreds of thousands of its users, spreading the attack across the platform.  The vulnerability involves a&nbsp; stored cross-site scripting flaw &nbsp;(also known as persistent XSS) in Koo's web application that allows malicious scripts to be embedded directly into the affected web application.  To carry out the attack, all a malicious actor had to do was log into the service via the web application and post an XSS-encoded payload to its timeline, which automatically gets executed on behalf of all users who saw the post.   The issue was discovered by security researcher&nbsp; Rahul Kankrale &nbsp;in July, following which a fix was rolled out by Koo on July 3.  Using cross-site scripting, an attacker can perform actions on behalf of users with the same privileges as the user and steal web browser's secrets, such as authentication

Multiple unpatched security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Mitsubishi safety programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that could be exploited by an adversary to acquire legitimate user names registered in the module via a brute-force attack, unauthorized login to the CPU module, and even cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.  The security weaknesses, disclosed by&nbsp; Nozomi Networks , concern the implementation of an authentication mechanism in the&nbsp; MELSEC communication protocol &nbsp;that's used to exchange data with the target devices that is used for communication with target devices by reading and writing data to the CPU module.   A quick summary of the flaws is listed below -   Username Brute-force (CVE-2021-20594, CVSS score: 5.9) - Usernames used during authentication are effectively brute-forceable  Anti-password Brute-force Functionality Leads to Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism (CVE-2021-20598, CVSS score: 3.7)  - The implementation to thwart brute-force at

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Networking equipment major Cisco has rolled out patches to address critical vulnerabilities impacting its Small Business VPN routers that could be abused by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and even cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.  The issues, tracked as CVE-2021-1609 (CVSS score: 9.8) and CVE-2021-1610 (CVSS score: 7.2), reside in the web-based management interface of the Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers running a firmware release prior to version 1.0.03.22. Both the issues stem from a lack of proper validation of HTTP requests, thus permitting a bad actor to send a specially-crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable device.   Successful exploitation of CVE-2021-1609 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. CVE-2021-1610, concerns a command injection vulnerability that, if exploited, could permit an authenticated adve

Cybersecurity researchers on Monday disclosed a set of nine vulnerabilities known as " PwnedPiper " that left a widely-used pneumatic tube system (PTS) vulnerable to critical attacks, including a possibility of complete takeover.  The security weaknesses, disclosed by American cybersecurity firm Armis, impact the Translogic PTS system by Swisslog Healthcare, which is installed in about 80% of all major hospitals in North America and in no fewer than 3,000 hospitals worldwide.   "These vulnerabilities can enable an unauthenticated attacker to take over Translogic PTS stations and essentially gain complete control over the PTS network of a target hospital," Armis researchers Ben Seri and Barak Hadad said. "This type of control could enable sophisticated and worrisome ransomware attacks, as well as allow attackers to leak sensitive hospital information."

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered multiple security vulnerabilities in Zimbra email collaboration software that could be potentially exploited to compromise email accounts by sending a malicious message and even achieve a full takeover of the mail server when hosted on a cloud infrastructure.  The flaws — tracked as CVE-2021-35208  and CVE-2021-35208  — were discovered and reported in Zimbra 8.8.15 by researchers from code quality and security solutions provider SonarSource in May 2021. Mitigations have since been&nbsp; released &nbsp;in Zimbra versions 8.8.15 Patch 23 and 9.0.0 Patch 16.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed nine security vulnerabilities affecting three open-source projects —&nbsp; EspoCRM ,&nbsp; Pimcore , and&nbsp; Akaunting &nbsp;— that are widely used by several small to medium businesses and, if successfully exploited, could provide a pathway to more sophisticated attacks.  All the security flaws in question, which impact EspoCRM v6.1.6, Pimcore Customer Data Framework v3.0.0, Pimcore AdminBundle v6.8.0, and Akaunting v2.1.12, were fixed within a day of responsible disclosure, researchers Wiktor Sędkowski of Nokia and Trevor Christiansen of Rapid7 noted. Six of the nine flaws were uncovered in the Akaunting project.   EspoCRM is an open-source customer relationship management (CRM) application, while Pimcore is an open-source enterprise software platform for customer data management, digital asset management, content management, and digital commerce. Akaunting, on the other hand, is an open-source and online accounting software designed for invoice and expe

Apple on Monday rolled out an urgent security update for&nbsp; iOS, iPadOS , and&nbsp; macOS &nbsp;to address a zero-day flaw that it said may have been actively exploited, making it the thirteenth such vulnerability Apple has patched since the start of this year.  The updates, which arrive less than a week after the company released iOS 14.7, iPadOS 14.7, and macOS Big Sur 11.5 to the public, fixes a memory corruption issue ( CVE-2021-30807 ) in the IOMobileFrameBuffer component, a kernel extension for managing the screen&nbsp; framebuffer , that could be abused to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.  The company said it addressed the issue with improved memory handling, noting it's "aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited." As is typically the case, additional details about the flaw have not been disclosed to prevent the weaponization of the vulnerability for additional attacks. Apple credited an anonymous researcher for discovering and reporting the

How to Mitigate Microsoft Windows 10, 11 SeriousSAM Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/how-to-mitigate-microsoft-windows-10-11.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows 11 users are at risk of a new unpatched vulnerability that was recently disclosed publicly.  As we reported last week, the vulnerability — SeriousSAM  — allows attackers with low-level permissions to access Windows system files to perform a Pass-the-Hash (and potentially Silver Ticket) attack.&nbsp;  Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to obtain hashed passwords stored in the Security Account Manager (SAM) and Registry, and ultimately run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.  SeriousSAM vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-36934 , exists in the default configuration of Windows 10 and Windows 11, specifically due to a setting that allows 'read' permissions to the built-in user's group that contains all local users.  As a result, built-in local users have access to read the SAM files and the Registry, where they can also view the hashes. Once the attacker has 'User' access, they can use a tool such as Mimikatz to gain access to the Re

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
After more than 20 years in the making, now it's official: APIs are everywhere. In a 2021 survey,&nbsp; 73% of enterprises reported that they already publish more than 50 APIs , and this number is constantly growing.  APIs have crucial roles to play in virtually every industry today, and their importance is increasing steadily, as they move to the forefront of business strategies. This comes as no surprise: APIs seamlessly connect disparate apps and devices, bringing business synergies and efficiencies never witnessed before.&nbsp;  However, APIs have vulnerabilities just like any other component of the software. Adding to that, if they aren't rigorously tested from a security standpoint, they can also introduce a whole new array of attack surfaces and expose you to unprecedented risks. If you wait until production to discover API vulnerabilities, you can incur substantial delays.  APIs are attractive to attackers, not just businesses  Keep in mind that APIs do more than simply connect

Oracle on Tuesday released its quarterly&nbsp; Critical Patch Update for July 2021 &nbsp;with 342 fixes spanning across multiple products, some of which could be exploited by a remote attacker to take control of an affected system.  Chief among them is&nbsp; CVE-2019-2729 , a critical deserialization vulnerability via XMLDecoder in Oracle WebLogic Server Web Services that's remotely exploitable without authentication. It's worth noting that the weakness was originally addressed as part of an&nbsp; out-of-band security update &nbsp;in June 2019.   Oracle WebLogic Server is an application server that functions as a platform for developing, deploying, and running enterprise Java-based applications.  The flaw, which is rated 9.8 out of a maximum of 10 on the CVSS severity scale, affects WebLogic Server versions 11.1.2.4 and 11.2.5.0 and exists within the Oracle Hyperion Infrastructure Technology.  Also fixed in WebLogic Server are six other flaws, three of which have been assigned a CVSS score of 9.8 out

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed multiple security vulnerabilities impacting CODESYS automation software and the WAGO programmable logic controller (PLC) platform that could be remotely exploited to take control of a company's cloud operational technology (OT) infrastructure.  The flaws can be turned "into innovative attacks that could put threat actors in position to remotely control a company's cloud OT implementation, and threaten any industrial process managed from the cloud," the New York-headquartered industrial security company Claroty said in a report  shared with The Hacker News, adding they "can be used to target a cloud-based management console from a compromised field device, or take over a company's cloud and attack PLCs and other devices to disrupt operations."   CODESYS is a development environment for programming controller applications, enabling easy configuration of PLCs in industrial control systems. WAGO PFC100/200 is

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a high severity security vulnerability affecting a software driver used in HP, Xerox, and Samsung printers that has remained undetected since 2005.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-3438 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), the issue concerns a buffer overflow in a print driver installer package named "SSPORT.SYS" that can enable remote privilege and arbitrary code execution. Hundreds of millions of printers have been released worldwide to date with the vulnerable driver in question.  However, there is no evidence that the flaw was abused in real-world attacks.   "A potential buffer overflow in the software drivers for certain HP LaserJet products and Samsung product printers could lead to an escalation of privilege," according to an advisory published in May.  The issue was reported to HP by threat intelligence researchers from SentinelLabs on February 18, 2021, following which&nbsp; remedies &nbsp;have been&nbsp; published &nbsp;for the affected printers as of May 19, 2021.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Wi-Fi network name bug that was found to completely disable an iPhone's networking functionality had remote code execution capabilities and was silently fixed by Apple earlier this year, according to new research.  The denial-of-service vulnerability,&nbsp; which came to light last month , stemmed from the way iOS handled string formats associated with the SSID input, triggering a crash on any up-to-date iPhone that connected to any wireless access points with percent symbols in their names such as "%p%s%s%s%s%n."  While the issue is remediable by resetting the network settings (Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings), Apple is&nbsp; expected to push a patch &nbsp;for the bug in its iOS 14.7 update, which is currently available to developers and public beta testers.   But in what could have had far-reaching consequences, researchers from mobile security automation firm ZecOps found that the same bug could be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on

Merely days after Microsoft sounded the alarm on an&nbsp; unpatched security vulnerability &nbsp;in the Windows Print Spooler service, yet another zero-day flaw in the same component has come to light, making it the fourth printer-related flaw to be discovered in recent weeks.  "Microsoft Windows allows for non-admin users to be able to install printer drivers via Point and Print," CERT Coordination Center's Will Dormann&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published Sunday. "Printers installed via this technique also install queue-specific files, which can be arbitrary libraries to be loaded by the privileged Windows Print Spooler process."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Web infrastructure and website security company Cloudflare last month fixed a critical vulnerability in its CDNJS library that's&nbsp; used by 12.7% of all websites &nbsp;on the internet.  CDNJS is a free and open-source content delivery network (CDN) that serves about&nbsp; 4,041 JavaScript and CSS libraries , making it the&nbsp; second most popular &nbsp;CDN for JavaScript after Google Hosted Libraries.  The weakness concerned an issue in the CDNJS library update server that could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, leading to a complete compromise.   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by security researcher RyotaK on April 6, 2021. There is no evidence of in-the-wild attacks abusing this flaw.  Specifically, the vulnerability works by publishing packages to Cloudflare's CDNJS using GitHub and npm, using it to trigger a&nbsp; path traversal vulnerability , and ultimately trick the server into executing arbitrary code, thus achieving remote code execution.

Google has pushed out a new security update to Chrome browser for Windows, Mac, and Linux with multiple fixes, including a zero-day that it says is being exploited in the wild.  The latest patch resolves a total of eight issues, one of which concerns a type confusion issue in its V8 open-source and JavaScript engine ( CVE-2021-30563 ). The search giant credited an anonymous researcher for reporting the flaw on July 12.   As is usually the case with actively exploited flaws, the company issued a terse statement acknowledging that "an exploit for CVE-2021-30563 exists in the wild" while refraining from sharing full details about the underlying vulnerability used in the attacks due to its serious nature and the possibility that doing so could lead to further abuse.  CVE-2021-30563 also marks the ninth zero-day addressed by Google to combat real-world attacks against Chrome users since the start of the year —   CVE-2021-21148 &nbsp;- Heap buffer overflow in V8  CVE-2021-21166 &nbsp;- Obje

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Thursday shared fresh guidance on yet another vulnerability affecting the Windows Print Spooler service, stating that it's working to address it in an upcoming security update.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-34481 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), the issue concerns a local privilege escalation flaw that could be abused to perform unauthorized actions on the system. The company credited security researcher Jacob Baines for discovering and reporting the bug.   "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Print Spooler service improperly performs privileged file operations. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges," the Windows maker said in its advisory. "An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights."  However, it's worth pointing out that successful exploitation of the vulnerability requires the attacker to have t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat intelligence researchers from Google on Wednesday&nbsp; shed more light &nbsp;on four in-the-wild zero-days in Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer browsers that were exploited by malicious actors in different campaigns since the start of the year.  What's more, three of the four zero-days were engineered by commercial providers and sold to and used by government-backed actors, contributing to an uptick in real-world attacks. The list of now-patched vulnerabilities is as follows -   CVE-2021-1879 : Use-After-Free in QuickTimePluginReplacement (Apple WebKit)  CVE-2021-21166 : Chrome Object Lifecycle Issue in Audio  CVE-2021-30551 : Chrome Type Confusion in V8  CVE-2021-33742 : Internet Explorer out-of-bounds write in MSHTML   Both Chrome zero-days — CVE-2021-21166 and CVE-2021-30551 — are believed to have been used by the same actor, and were delivered as one-time links sent via email to targets located in Armenia, with the links redirecting unsuspecting users to attacker-controlled

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed new security vulnerabilities in the Etherpad text editor (version 1.8.13) that could potentially enable attackers to hijack administrator accounts, execute system commands, and even steal sensitive documents.  The two flaws — tracked as CVE-2021-34816  and CVE-2021-34817 — were discovered and reported on June 4 by researchers from SonarSource, following which patches have been shipped for the latter in&nbsp; version 1.8.14 &nbsp;of Etherpad released on July 4.  Etherpad is a real-time collaborative interface that enables a document to be edited simultaneously by multiple authors. It is an open-source alternative to Google Docs that can be self-hosted or used through one of the many third-party public  instances available.  "The XSS vulnerability allows attackers to take over Etherpad users, including admins. This can be used to steal or manipulate sensitive data," SonarSource vulnerability researcher Paul Gerste&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with T

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity agencies in Australia and the U.S. are&nbsp; warning &nbsp;of an actively exploited vulnerability impacting ForgeRock's OpenAM access management solution that could be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on an affected system remotely.  "The [Australian Cyber Security Centre] has observed actors exploiting this vulnerability to compromise multiple hosts and deploy additional malware and tools," the organization&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert. ACSC didn't disclose the nature of the attacks, how widespread they are, or the identities of the threat actors exploiting them.   Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-35464 , the issue concerns a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in ForgeRock Access Manager identity and access management tool, and stems from an&nbsp; unsafe Java deserialization &nbsp;in the Jato framework used by the software.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
SolarWinds, the Texas-based company that became the epicenter of a&nbsp; massive supply chain attack &nbsp;late last year, has issued patches to contain a remote code execution flaw in its Serv-U managed file transfer service.  The fixes, which target Serv-U Managed File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP products, arrive after Microsoft notified the IT management and remote monitoring software maker that the flaw was being exploited in the wild. The threat actor behind the exploitation remains unknown as yet, and it isn't clear exactly how the attack was carried out.   "Microsoft has provided evidence of limited, targeted customer impact, though SolarWinds does not currently have an estimate of how many customers may be directly affected by the vulnerability," SolarWinds&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published Friday, adding it's "unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
This week, PrintNightmare  - Microsoft's Print Spooler vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) was upgraded from a 'Low' criticality to a 'Critical' criticality.  This is due to a Proof of Concept published on GitHub, which attackers could potentially leverage for gaining access to Domain Controllers.  As we reported earlier , Microsoft already released a patch in June 2021, but it wasn't enough to stop exploits. Attackers can still use Print Spooler when connecting remotely. You can find all you need to know about this vulnerability in this article and how you can mitigate it (and you can).&nbsp;  Print Spooler in a nutshell: &nbsp;Print Spooler is Microsoft's service for managing and monitoring files printing. This service is among Microsoft's oldest and has had minimal maintenance updates since it was released.&nbsp;  Every Microsoft machine (servers and endpoints) has this feature enabled by default.

Microsoft's Emergency Patch Fails to Fully Fix PrintNightmare RCE Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/microsofts-emergency-patch-fails-to.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Even as Microsoft&nbsp; expanded patches &nbsp;for the so-called PrintNightmare vulnerability for Windows 10 version 1607, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016, it has come to light that the fix for the remote code execution exploit in the Windows Print Spooler service can be bypassed in certain scenarios, effectively defeating the security protections and permitting attackers to run arbitrary code on infected systems.  On Tuesday, the Windows maker issued an&nbsp; emergency out-of-band update &nbsp;to address&nbsp; CVE-2021-34527 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8) after the flaw was accidentally disclosed by researchers from Hong Kong-based cybersecurity firm Sangfor late last month, at which point it emerged that the issue was different from another bug — tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-1675 &nbsp;— that was patched by Microsoft on June 8.

An analysis of off-the-shelf packages hosted on the NuGet repository has revealed 51 unique software components to be vulnerable to actively exploited, high-severity vulnerabilities, once again underscoring the threat posed by third-party dependencies to the software development process.  In light of the growing number of cyber incidents that target the software supply chain, there is an urgent need to assess such third-party modules for any security risks and minimize the attack surface, ReversingLabs researcher Karlo Zanki said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  NuGet &nbsp;is a Microsoft-supported mechanism for the .NET platform and functions as a package manager designed to enable developers to share reusable code. The framework maintains a central repository of over 264,000 unique packages that have collectively produced more than 109 billion package downloads.

Microsoft is urging Azure users to&nbsp; update &nbsp;the PowerShell command-line tool as soon as possible to protect against a critical remote code execution vulnerability impacting .NET Core.  The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-26701 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.1), affects PowerShell versions 7.0 and 7.1 and have been remediated in versions 7.0.6 and 7.1.3, respectively. Windows PowerShell 5.1 isn't impacted by the flaw.  Built on the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR),&nbsp; PowerShell &nbsp;is a cross-platform task automation utility that consists of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework.   "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in .NET 5 and .NET Core due to how text encoding is performed," the company&nbsp; noted in an advisory &nbsp;published earlier this April, adding that the problem resides in the " System.Text.Encodings.Web " package, which provides types for encoding and escaping strings for use in JavaScript, HTML, and URLs.

Microsoft on Thursday officially confirmed that the "PrintNightmare" remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting Windows Print Spooler is different from the issue the company addressed as part of its Patch Tuesday update released earlier this month, while warning that it has detected exploitation attempts targeting the flaw.  The company is tracking the security weakness under the identifier&nbsp; CVE-2021-34527 .   "A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows Print Spooler service improperly performs privileged file operations," Microsoft said in its advisory. "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed critical security vulnerabilities affecting&nbsp; NETGEAR DGN2200v1 series routers , which they say could be reliably abused as a jumping-off point to compromise a network's security and gain unfettered access.  The three&nbsp; HTTPd &nbsp;authentication security weaknesses (CVSS scores: 7.1 – 9.4) impact routers running firmware versions prior to v1.0.0.60, and have since been&nbsp; fixed by the company &nbsp;in December 2020 as part of a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process.   "The rising number of firmware attacks and ransomware attacks via VPN devices and other internet-facing systems are examples of attacks initiated outside and below the operating system layer," Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team's Jonathan Bar Or&nbsp; said . "As these types of attacks become more common, users must look to secure even the single-purpose software that run their hardware—like routers."   In a nutshell, the flaws allow accessing router management pa

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit related to a remote code execution vulnerability affecting Windows Print Spooler and patched by Microsoft earlier this month was briefly published online before being taken down.  Identified as&nbsp; CVE-2021-1675 , the security issue could grant remote attackers full control of vulnerable systems.&nbsp; Print Spooler &nbsp;manages the printing process in Windows, including loading the appropriate printer drivers, and scheduling the print job for printing, among others.  Print Spooler flaws are concerning, not least because of the wide attack surface, but also owing to the fact that it runs at the highest privilege level and is capable of dynamically loading third-party binaries.   "Either the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate

Unpatched Virtual Machine Takeover Bug Affects Google Compute Engine<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/unpatched-virtual-machine-takeover-bug.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unpatched security vulnerability affecting Google's Compute Engine platform could be abused by an attacker to take over virtual machines over the network.  "This is done by impersonating the metadata server from the targeted virtual machine's point of view," security researcher Imre Rad said in an&nbsp; analysis &nbsp;published Friday. "By mounting this exploit, the attacker can grant access to themselves over SSH (public key authentication) so then they can login as the root user."  Google Compute Engine ( GCE ) is an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) component of Google Cloud Platform that enables users to create and launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand. GCE provides a method for storing and retrieving metadata in the form of the&nbsp; metadata server , which offers a central point to set metadata in the form of key-value pairs that's then provided to virtual machines at runtime.   According to the researcher, the issue is a consequence of weak pseudo-random

A security vulnerability in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) that was addressed by the company last October and again earlier this April, has been subjected to active in-the-wild attacks following the release of proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code.  The PoC was&nbsp; published &nbsp;by researchers from cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies on June 24, following which reports emerged that attackers are chasing after an exploit for the bug.   "Tenable has also received a report that attackers are exploiting CVE-2020-3580 in the wild," the cyber exposure company&nbsp; said .   Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2020-3580 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.1), the issue concerns multiple vulnerabilities in the web services interface of Cisco ASA software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on an affected device.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday disclosed a chain of vulnerabilities affecting the BIOSConnect feature within Dell Client BIOS that could be abused by a privileged network adversary to gain arbitrary code execution at the BIOS/UEFI level of the affected device.  "As the attacker has the ability to remotely execute code in the pre-boot environment, this can be used to subvert the operating system and undermine fundamental trust in the device," researchers from enterprise device security firm Eclypsium said . "The virtually unlimited control over a device that this attack can provide makes the fruit of the labor well worth it for the attacker."   In all, the flaws affect 128 Dell models spanning across consumer and business laptops, desktops, and tablets, totalling an estimated 30 million individual devices. Worse, the weaknesses also impact computers that have&nbsp; Secure Boot &nbsp;enabled, a security feature designed to prevent&nbsp; rootkits from being installed &nbsp;at boot

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware has rolled out security updates to resolve a critical flaw affecting Carbon Black App Control that could be exploited to bypass authentication and take control of vulnerable systems.  The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2021-21998, is rated 9.4 out of 10 in severity by the industry-standard Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and affects App Control (AppC) versions 8.0.x, 8.1.x, 8.5.x, and 8.6.x.  Carbon Black App Control &nbsp;is a security solution designed to lock down critical systems and servers to prevent unauthorized changes in the face of cyber-attacks and ensure compliance with regulatory mandates such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, FISMA, and NERC.   "A malicious actor with network access to the VMware Carbon Black App Control management server might be able to obtain administrative access to the product without the need to authenticate," the California-based cloud computing and virtualization technology company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory.

Open-source Tor browser has been updated to version 10.0.18 with fixes for multiple issues, including a privacy-defeating bug that could be used to uniquely fingerprint users across different browsers based on the apps installed on a computer.  In addition to&nbsp; updating &nbsp;Tor to 0.4.5.9, the browser's Android version has been upgraded to Firefox to version 89.1.1, alongside incorporating patches rolled out by Mozilla for several&nbsp; security vulnerabilities &nbsp;addressed in Firefox 89.   Chief among the rectified issues is a new fingerprinting attack that came to light last month. Dubbed&nbsp; scheme flooding , the vulnerability enables a malicious website to leverage information about installed apps on the system to assign users a permanent unique identifier even when they switch browsers, use incognito mode, or a VPN.  Put differently, the&nbsp; weakness &nbsp;takes advantage of custom URL schemes in apps as an attack vector, allowing a bad actor to track a device's user between different browsers

A critical vulnerability in SonicWall VPN appliances that was believed to have been patched last year has been now found to be "botched," with the company leaving a memory leak flaw unaddressed, until now, that could permit a remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.  The shortcoming was rectified in an update rolled out to SonicOS on June 22.&nbsp;  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-20019 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 5.3), the vulnerability is the consequence of a memory leak when sending a specially-crafted unauthenticated HTTP request, culminating in information disclosure.   It's worth noting that SonicWall's decision to hold back the patch comes amid&nbsp; multiple &nbsp; zero-day &nbsp; disclosures &nbsp;affecting its remote access VPN and email security products that have been exploited in a series of in-the-wild attacks to deploy backdoors and a new strain of ransomware called FIVEHANDS.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new research published by a group of academics has found that anti-virus programs for Android continue to remain vulnerable against different permutations of malware, in what could pose a serious risk as malicious actors evolve their toolsets to better evade analysis.  "Malware writers use stealthy mutations (morphing/obfuscations) to continuously develop malware clones, thwarting detection by signature based detectors," the researchers&nbsp; said . "This attack of clones seriously threatens all the mobile platforms, especially Android."   The findings were published in a study last week by researchers from Adana Science and Technology University, Turkey, and the National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan.  Unlike iOS, apps can be downloaded from third-party sources on Android devices, raising the possibility that unwitting users can install unverified and lookalike apps that clone a legitimate app's functionality but are built to trick tar

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday issued an advisory regarding a critical software supply-chain flaw impacting ThroughTek's software development kit (SDK) that could be abused by an adversary to gain improper access to audio and video streams.  "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could permit unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as camera audio/video feeds," CISA&nbsp; said &nbsp;in the alert.

Instagram has patched a new flaw that allowed anyone to view archived posts and stories posted by private accounts without having to follow them.  "This bug could have allowed a malicious user to view targeted media on Instagram," Mayur Fartade&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Medium post today. "An attacker could have been able to see details of private/archived posts, stories, reels, IGTV without following the user using Media ID."   Fartade disclosed the issue to Facebook's security team on April 16, 2021, following which the shortcoming was patched on June 15. He was also awarded $30,000 as part of the company's bug bounty program.    Although the attack requires knowing the media ID associated with an image, video, or album, by brute-forcing the identifiers, Fartade demonstrated that it was possible to craft a POST request to a GraphQL endpoint and retrieve sensitive data.   As a consequence of the flaw, details such as like/comment/save count, display_url, and image.uri c

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A seven-year-old privilege escalation vulnerability discovered in the polkit system service could be exploited by a malicious unprivileged local attacker to bypass authorization and escalate permissions to the root user.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-3560 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), the flaw affects polkit versions between 0.113 and 0.118 and was discovered by GitHub security researcher Kevin Backhouse, who said the issue was&nbsp; introduced in a code commit &nbsp;made on Nov. 9, 2013. Red Hat's Cedric Buissart&nbsp; noted &nbsp;that Debian-based distributions, based on polkit 0.105, are also vulnerable.   Polkit &nbsp;(née PolicyKit) is a toolkit for defining and handling authorizations in Linux distributions, and is used for allowing unprivileged processes to communicate with privileged processes.  "When a requesting process disconnects from dbus-daemon just before the call to polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync starts, the process cannot get a unique uid and pid of the process and it cannot verify the privileg

Attention readers, if you are using Google Chrome browser on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computers, you need to update it immediately to the latest version Google released earlier today.  Google on Wednesday rolled out an urgent update for Chrome browser to address 14 newly discovered security issues, including a zero-day flaw that it says is being actively exploited in the wild.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-30551 , the vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue in its V8 open-source and JavaScript engine. Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw.   Although the search giant's Chrome team issued a terse statement acknowledging "an exploit for CVE-2021-30551 exists in the wild," Shane Huntley, Director of Google's Threat Analysis Group,&nbsp; hinted &nbsp;that the vulnerability was leveraged by the same actor that abused&nbsp; CVE-2021-33742 , an actively exploited remote code execution flaw in Windows MSHTML platform that was ad

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Four security vulnerabilities discovered in the Microsoft Office suite, including Excel and Office online, could be potentially abused by bad actors to deliver attack code via Word and Excel documents.  "Rooted from legacy code, the vulnerabilities could have granted an attacker the ability to execute code on targets via malicious Office documents, such as Word, Excel and Outlook," researchers from Check Point research said in a report published  today.  Three of the four flaws — tracked as CVE-2021-31174, CVE-2021-31178, CVE-2021-31179 — have been fixed by Microsoft as part of its Patch Tuesday update  for May 2021, with the fourth patch (CVE-2021-31939) to be issued in June's update rolling out later today.   In a hypothetical attack scenario, the researchers said the vulnerability could be triggered as simply as opening a malicious Excel (.XLS) file that's served via a download link or an email.  Arising out of parsing mistakes made in legacy code found in Excel 9

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors are actively mass scanning the internet for vulnerable VMware vCenter servers that are unpatched against a critical remote code execution flaw, which the company addressed late last month.  The ongoing activity was detected by Bad Packets on June 3 and corroborated&nbsp; yesterday &nbsp;by security researcher Kevin Beaumont. "Mass scanning activity detected from 104.40.252.159 checking for VMware vSphere hosts vulnerable to remote code execution,"&nbsp; tweeted &nbsp;Troy Mursch, chief research officer at Bad Packets.   The development follows the publication of a proof-of-concept  (PoC) RCE exploit code targeting the VMware vCenter bug.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-21985 &nbsp;(CVSS score 9.8), the issue is a consequence of a lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN (vSAN) Health Check plug-in, which could be abused by an attacker to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts the vCenter Server.   Although the flaw was rectified by VMwar

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday disclosed as many as ten critical vulnerabilities impacting CODESYS automation software that could be exploited to remote code execution on programmable logic controllers (PLCs).  "To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker does not need a username or password; having network access to the industrial controller is enough," researchers from Positive Technologies&nbsp; said . "The main cause of the vulnerabilities is insufficient verification of input data, which may itself be caused by failure to comply with the secure development recommendations."  The Russian cybersecurity firm noted that it detected the vulnerabilities on a PLC offered by WAGO, which, among other automation technology companies such as Beckhoff, Kontron, Moeller, Festo, Mitsubishi, and HollySys, use CODESYS software for&nbsp; programming and configuring &nbsp;the controllers.

Major software vulnerabilities are a fact of life, as illustrated by the fact that Microsoft has patched between 55 and 110 vulnerabilities each month this year – with 7% to 17% of those vulnerabilities being critical.  May had the fewest vulnerabilities, with a total of 55 and only four considered critical. The problem is that the critical vulnerabilities are things we have seen for many years, like remote code execution and privilege escalation.  Microsoft isn't the only big name regularly patching major vulnerabilities: We see monthly security updates coming from Apple, Adobe, Google, Cisco, and others.  Everything old is new again  With major vulnerabilities in so many applications, is there any hope for a secure future? The answer is, of course, yes, but that does not mean there won't be challenges getting there.  The vulnerabilities being seen may not be new to those of us who have been defending against attackers  for years or even decades, but the adversaries continual

A new set of critical vulnerabilities has been disclosed in the Realtek RTL8170C Wi-Fi module that an adversary could abuse to gain elevated privileges on a device and hijack wireless communications.  "Successful exploitation would lead to complete control of the Wi-Fi module and potential root access on the OS (such as Linux or Android) of the embedded device that uses this module," researchers from Israeli IoT security firm Vdoo&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published yesterday.  The Realtek&nbsp; RTL8710C &nbsp;Wi-Fi SoC underpins Ameba, an Arduino-compatible programmable platform equipped with peripheral interfaces for building a variety of IoT applications by devices spanning across agriculture, automotive, energy, healthcare, industrial, security, and smart home sectors.

Fancy Product Designer, a WordPress plugin installed on over 17,000 sites, has been discovered to contain a critical file upload vulnerability that's being actively exploited in the wild to upload malware onto sites that have the plugin installed.  Wordfence's threat intelligence team, which discovered the flaw, said it reported the issue to the plugin's developer on May 31. While the flaw has been acknowledged, it's yet to be addressed.  Fancy Product Designer is a tool that enables businesses to offer customizable products, allowing customers to design any kind of item ranging from T-shirts to phone cases by offering the ability to upload images and PDF files that can be added to the products.   "Unfortunately, while the plugin had some checks in place to prevent malicious files from being uploaded, these checks were insufficient and could easily be bypassed, allowing attackers to upload executable PHP files to any site with the plugin installed," Wordfence

A New Bug in Siemens PLCs Could Let Hackers Run Malicious Code Remotely<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/a-new-bug-in-siemens-plcs-could-let.html"> Full Text</a>

Siemens on Friday shipped firmed updates to address a severe vulnerability in SIMATIC S7-1200 and S7-1500 programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that could be exploited by a malicious actor to remotely gain access to protected areas of the memory and achieve unrestricted and undetected code execution, in what the researchers describe as an attacker's "holy grail."  The memory protection bypass vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2020-15782 (CVSS score: 8.1), was discovered by operational technology security company Claroty by reverse-engineering the MC7 / MC7+ bytecode language used to execute PLC programs in the microprocessor. There's no evidence that the weakness was abused in the wild.   In an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;issued by Siemens, the German industrial automation firm said an unauthenticated, remote attacker with network access to TCP port 102 could potentially write arbitrary data and code to protected memory areas or read sensitive data to launch further attacks.

Severe security flaws uncovered in popular Visual Studio Code extensions could enable attackers to compromise local machines as well as build and deployment systems through a developer's integrated development environment (IDE).

Some of the extensions in question are "LaTeX Workshop," "Rainbow Fart," "Open in Default Browser," and "Instant Markdown," all of which have cumulatively racked up about two million installations between them.  "Developer machines usually hold significant credentials, allowing them (directly or indirectly) to interact with many parts of the product," researchers from open-source security platform Synk&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep-dive published on May 26.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware has rolled out patches to address a critical security vulnerability in vCenter Server that could be leveraged by an adversary to execute arbitrary code on the server.  Tracked as CVE-2021-21985 (CVSS score 9.8), the issue stems from a lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN ( vSAN ) Health Check plug-in, which is enabled by default in the vCenter Server. "A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server," VMware&nbsp; said &nbsp;in its advisory.   VMware vCenter Server is a server management utility that's used to control virtual machines, ESXi hosts, and other dependent components from a single centralized location. The flaw affects vCenter Server versions 6.5, 6.7, and 7.0 and Cloud Foundation versions 3.x and 4.x. VMware credited Ricter Z of 360 Noah Lab for reporting the vulnerability.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ivanti, the company behind Pulse Secure VPN appliances, has published a security advisory for a high severity vulnerability that may allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.  "Buffer Overflow in Windows File Resource Profiles in 9.X allows a remote authenticated user with privileges to browse SMB shares to execute arbitrary code as the root user," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert published on May 14. "As of version 9.1R3, this permission is not enabled by default."  The flaw, identified as CVE-2021-22908, has a CVSS score of 8.5 out of a maximum of 10 and impacts Pulse Connect Secure versions 9.0Rx and 9.1Rx. In a report detailing the vulnerability, the CERT Coordination Center said the issue stems from the gateway's ability to connect to Windows file shares through a number of CGI endpoints that could be leveraged to carry out the attack.

New Bluetooth Flaws Let Attackers Impersonate Legitimate Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/new-bluetooth-flaws-let-attackers.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Adversaries could exploit newly discovered security weaknesses in Bluetooth Core and Mesh Profile Specifications to masquerade as legitimate devices and carry out man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  "Devices supporting the Bluetooth&nbsp; Core &nbsp;and&nbsp; Mesh Specifications &nbsp;are vulnerable to impersonation attacks and AuthValue disclosure that could allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate device during pairing," the Carnegie Mellon CERT Coordination Center&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published Monday.  The two Bluetooth specifications define the standard that allows for many-to-many communication over Bluetooth to facilitate data transfer between devices in an ad-hoc network.   The Bluetooth Impersonation AttackS, aka BIAS , enable a malicious actor to establish a secure connection with a victim, without having to know and authenticate the long-term key shared between the victims, thus effectively bypassing Bluetooth's authentication mechanism.  "The BIAS attacks are the first

Apple on Monday rolled out security updates for&nbsp; iOS ,&nbsp; macOS ,&nbsp; tvOS ,&nbsp; watchOS , and&nbsp; Safari &nbsp;web browser to fix multiple vulnerabilities, including an actively exploited zero-day flaw in macOS Big Sur and expand patches for two previously disclosed zero-day flaws.&nbsp;  Tracked as CVE-2021-30713, the zero-day concerns a permissions issue in Apple's Transparency, Consent, and Control ( TCC ) framework in macOS that maintains a database of each user's consents. The iPhone maker acknowledged that the issue may have been exploited in the wild but stopped short of sharing specifics.   The company noted that it rectified the problem with improved validation.  However, in a separate report, mobile device management company Jamf said the bypass flaw was being actively exploited by XCSSET, a malware that's been out in the wild since August 2020 and known to propagate via modified&nbsp; Xcode IDE projects &nbsp;hosted on GitHub repositories and plant malicious packages into legitimate apps ins

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers disclosed details about 13 vulnerabilities in the Nagios network monitoring application that could be abused by an adversary to hijack the infrastructure without any operator intervention.  "In a telco setting, where a telco is monitoring thousands of sites, if a customer site is fully compromised, an attacker can use the vulnerabilities to compromise the telco, and then every other monitored customer site," Adi Ashkenazy, CEO of Australian cybersecurity firm Skylight Cyber, told The Hacker News via email.  Nagios is an open-source IT infrastructure tool analogous to SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor (NPM) that offers monitoring and alerting services for servers, network cards, applications, and services.  The issues, which consist of a mix of authenticated remote code execution (RCE) and privilege escalation flaws, were discovered and reported to Nagios in October 2020, following which they were&nbsp; remediated &nbsp;in&nbsp; November .

Latest research has demonstrated a new exploit that enables arbitrary data to be uploaded from devices that are not connected to the Internet by simply sending "Find My Bluetooth" broadcasts to nearby Apple devices.  "It's possible to upload arbitrary data from non-internet-connected devices by sending Find My [Bluetooth Low Energy] broadcasts to nearby Apple devices that then upload the data for you," Positive Security researcher Fabian Bräunlein&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up disclosed last week.  "Being inherent to the privacy and security-focused design of the Find My Offline Finding system, it seems unlikely that this misuse can be prevented completely."   The study builds on a previous study by TU Darmstadt&nbsp; published &nbsp;in March 2021, which disclosed two distinct design and implementation flaws in Apple's crowdsourced Bluetooth location tracking system that could lead to a location correlation attack and unauthorized access to a user's lo

Three design and multiple implementation flaws have been disclosed in IEEE 802.11 technical standard that undergirds Wi-Fi, potentially enabling an adversary to take control over a system and plunder confidential data.  Called&nbsp; FragAttacks &nbsp;(short for FRgmentation and AGgregation attacks), the weaknesses impact all Wi-Fi security protocols, from Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) all the way to Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3), thus virtually putting almost every wireless-enabled device at risk of attack.  "An adversary that is within radio range of a victim can abuse these vulnerabilities to steal user information or attack devices," Mathy Vanhoef, a security academic at New York University Abu Dhabi, said. "Experiments indicate that every Wi-Fi product is affected by at least one vulnerability and that most products are affected by several vulnerabilities."

Microsoft on Tuesday rolled out its scheduled&nbsp; monthly security update &nbsp;with patches for 55 security flaws affecting Windows, Exchange Server, Internet Explorer, Office, Hyper-V, Visual Studio, and Skype for Business.  Of these 55 bugs, four are rated as Critical, 50 are rated as Important, and one is listed as Moderate in severity. Three of the vulnerabilities are publicly known, although, unlike&nbsp; last month , none of them are under active exploitation at the time of release.   The most critical of the flaws addressed is&nbsp; CVE-2021-31166 , a wormable remote code execution vulnerability in the HTTP protocol stack. The issue, which could allow an unauthenticated attacker to send a specially crafted packet to a targeted server, is rated 9.8 out of a maximum of 10 on the CVSS scale.  Another vulnerability of note is a remote code execution flaw in Hyper-V ( CVE-2021-28476 ), which also scores  the highest severity among all flaws patched this month with a CVSS rating of 9.9.

Top 11 Security Flaws Russian Spy Hackers Are Exploiting in the Wild<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/top-11-security-flaws-russian-spy.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cyber operatives affiliated with the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) have switched up their tactics in response to previous public disclosures  of their attack methods, according to a&nbsp; new advisory &nbsp;jointly published by intelligence agencies from the U.K. and U.S. Friday.  "SVR cyber operators appear to have reacted [...] by changing their TTPs in an attempt to avoid further detection and remediation efforts by network defenders," the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)&nbsp; said .  These include the deployment of an open-source tool called&nbsp; Sliver &nbsp;to maintain their access to compromised victims as well as leveraging the ProxyLogon flaws in Microsoft Exchange servers to conduct post-exploitation activities.   The development followed the&nbsp; public attribution &nbsp;of SVR-linked actors to the&nbsp; SolarWinds &nbsp;supply-chain attack last month. The adversary is also tracked under different monikers, such as Advanced Persistent Threat 29 (APT29), the Dukes, CozyBear, and Yttrium.

As many as six zero-days have been uncovered in an application called Remote Mouse, allowing a remote attacker to achieve full code execution without any user interaction.  The unpatched flaws, collectively named ' Mouse Trap, ' were disclosed on Wednesday by security researcher Axel Persinger, who said, "It's clear that this application is very vulnerable and puts users at risk with bad authentication mechanisms, lack of encryption, and poor default configuration."   Remote Mouse is a remote control application for Android and iOS that turns mobile phones and tablets into a wireless mouse, keyboard, and trackpad for computers, with support for voice typing, adjusting computer volume, and switching between applications with the help of a Remote Mouse server installed on the machine. The Android app alone has been installed over 10 million times.  In a nutshell, the issues, which were identified by analysing the packets sent from the Android app to its Windows ser

New tsuNAME Flaw Could Let Attackers Take Down Authoritative DNS Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/new-tsuname-flaw-could-let-attackers.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers Thursday disclosed a new critical vulnerability affecting Domain Name System (DNS) resolvers that could be exploited by adversaries to carry out denial-of-service attacks against authoritative nameservers.  The flaw, called&nbsp; 'TsuNAME ,' was discovered by researchers from SIDN Labs and InternetNZ, which manage the national top-level internet domains '.nl' and '.nz' for the Netherlands and New Zealand, respectively.  "TsuNAME occurs when domain names are misconfigured with cyclic dependent DNS records, and when vulnerable resolvers access these misconfigurations, they begin looping and send DNS queries rapidly to authoritative servers and other resolvers," the researchers said.   A recursive DNS resolver is one of the core components involved in&nbsp; DNS resolution , i.e., converting a hostname such as www.google.com into a computer-friendly IP address like 142.250.71.36. To achieve this, it responds to a client's request for a web

Critical Flaws Hit Cisco SD-WAN vManage and HyperFlex Software<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/critical-flaws-hit-cisco-sd-wan-vmanage.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Networking equipment major Cisco has rolled out software updates to address multiple critical vulnerabilities impacting HyperFlex HX and SD-WAN vManage Software that could allow an attacker to perform command injection attacks, execute arbitrary code, and gain access to sensitive information.  In a series of advisories published on May 5, the company said there are no workarounds that remediate the issues.  The HyperFlex HX command injection vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2021-1497 and CVE-2021-1498 (CVSS scores 9.8), affect all Cisco devices running HyperFlex HX software versions 4.0, 4.5, and those prior to 4.0. Arising due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform, the flaws could enable an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack against a vulnerable device.   "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management int

New Qualcomm Chip Bug Could Let Hackers Spy On Android Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/new-qualcomm-chip-bug-could-let-hackers.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new security vulnerability in Qualcomm's mobile station modems (MSM) that could potentially allow an attacker to leverage the underlying Android operating system to slip malicious code into mobile phones, undetected.  "If exploited, the vulnerability would have allowed an attacker to use Android OS itself as an entry point to inject malicious and invisible code into phones, granting them access to SMS messages and audio of phone conversations," researchers from Israeli security firm Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published today.  The heap overflow vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2020-11292 , resides in the QMI voice service API exposed by the modem to the high level operating system, and could be exploited by a malicious app to conceal its activities "underneath" the OS in the modem chip itself, thus making it invisible to the security protections built into the device.   Designed since the 1990s, Qualcomm&nbsp; MSM &nbsp;chip

When Spectre, a class of critical vulnerabilities impacting modern processors, was&nbsp; publicly revealed &nbsp;in January 2018, the researchers behind the discovery&nbsp; said , "As it is not easy to fix, it will haunt us for quite some time," explaining the inspiration behind naming the speculative execution attacks.  Indeed, it's been more than three years, and there is no end to Spectre in sight.  A team of academics from the University of Virginia and University of California, San Diego, have discovered a&nbsp; new line of attack &nbsp;that bypasses all current Spectre protections built into the chips, potentially putting almost every system — desktops, laptops, cloud servers, and smartphones — once again at risk just as they were three years ago.   The disclosure of&nbsp; Spectre and Meltdown &nbsp;opened a&nbsp; floodgates &nbsp;of sorts, what with&nbsp; endless &nbsp; variants &nbsp;of the&nbsp; attacks &nbsp;coming to light in the intervening years, even as chipmakers like Intel, ARM, and AMD have continually scrambled to incorpo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new academic study has highlighted a number of privacy and security pitfalls associated with recycling mobile phone numbers that could be abused to stage a variety of exploits, including account takeovers, conduct phishing and spam attacks, and even prevent victims from signing up for online services.  Nearly 66% of the recycled numbers that were sampled were found to be tied to previous owners' online accounts at popular websites, potentially enabling account hijacks by simply recovering the accounts tied to those numbers.  "An attacker can cycle through the available numbers shown on online number change interfaces and check if any of them are associated with online accounts of previous owners," the researchers&nbsp; said . If so, the attacker can then obtain these numbers and reset the password on the accounts, and receive and correctly enter the OTP sent via SMS upon login."   The findings are part of an analysis of a sample of 259 phone numbers available to new su

PC maker Dell has issued an update to fix multiple critical privilege escalation vulnerabilities that went undetected since 2009, potentially allowing attackers to gain kernel-mode privileges and cause a denial-of-service condition.  The issues, reported to Dell by researchers from SentinelOne on Dec. 1, 2020, reside in a firmware update driver named "dbutil_2_3.sys" that comes pre-installed on its devices. Hundreds of millions of desktops, laptops, notebooks, and tablets manufactured by the company are said to be vulnerable.   "Dell dbutil_2_3.sys driver contains an insufficient access control vulnerability which may lead to escalation of privileges, denial-of-service, or information disclosure. Local authenticated user access is required," Dell&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory.  All five separate flaws have been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2021-21551 with a CVSS score of 8.8.

Ivanti, the company behind Pulse Secure VPN appliances, has released a security patch to remediate a critical security vulnerability that was found being actively exploited in the wild by at least two different threat actors.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-22893 &nbsp;(CVSS score 10), the flaw concerns "multiple use after free" issues in Pulse Connect Secure that could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code and take control of the affected system. All Pulse Connect Secure versions prior to 9.1R11.4 are impacted.   The flaw came to light on April 20 after FireEye&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a series of intrusions targeting defense, government, and financial organizations in the U.S. and elsewhere by leveraging critical vulnerabilities in the remote access solution to bypass multi-factor authentication protections and breach enterprise networks.  The development promoted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue an&nbsp; Emergency Directive &nbsp;urging fede

F5 BIG-IP Found Vulnerable to Kerberos KDC Spoofing Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/f5-big-ip-found-vulnerable-to-kerberos.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed a new bypass vulnerability in the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) security feature impacting F5 Big-IP application delivery services.  "The KDC Spoofing vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the Kerberos authentication to Big-IP Access Policy Manager (APM), bypass security policies and gain unfettered access to sensitive workloads," Silverfort researchers Yaron Kassner and Rotem Zach said in a report. "In some cases this can be used to bypass authentication to the Big-IP admin console as well."  Coinciding with the public disclosure, F5 has released a patch to address the weakness.   Kerberos &nbsp;is an authentication protocol that relies on a client-server model for mutual authentication and requires a trusted intermediary called Key Distribution Center ( KDC ) — a Kerberos Authentication Server (AS) or a Ticket Granting Server in this case — that acts as a repository of shared secret keys of all users as we

New research has uncovered privacy weaknesses in Apple's wireless file-sharing protocol that could result in the exposure of a user's contact information such as email addresses and phone numbers.  "As an attacker, it is possible to learn the phone numbers and email addresses of AirDrop users – even as a complete stranger,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;a team of academics from the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany. "All they require is a Wi-Fi-capable device and physical proximity to a target that initiates the discovery process by opening the sharing pane on an iOS or macOS device."  AirDrop &nbsp;is a proprietary ad hoc service present in Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems, allowing users to transfer files between devices by making use of close-range wireless communication.

Critical RCE Bug Found in Homebrew Package Manager for macOS and Linux<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/critical-rce-bug-found-in-homebrew.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recently identified security vulnerability in the official Homebrew Cask repository could have been exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on users' machines that have Homebrew installed.  The issue, which was reported to the maintainers on April 18 by a Japanese security researcher named RyotaK, stemmed from the way code changes in its&nbsp; GitHub repository &nbsp;were handled, resulting in a scenario where a malicious&nbsp; pull request &nbsp;— i.e., the proposed changes — could be automatically reviewed and approved. The flaw was fixed on April 19.   Homebrew is a free and open-source software package manager solution that allows the installation of software on Apple's macOS operating system as well as Linux. Homebrew&nbsp; Cask &nbsp;extends the functionality to include command-line workflows for GUI-based macOS applications, fonts, plugins, and other non-open source software.

A new ransomware strain called " Qlocker " is targeting QNAP network attached storage (NAS) devices as part of an ongoing campaign and encrypting files in password-protected 7zip archives.  First reports of the&nbsp; infections &nbsp;emerged on April 20, with the adversaries behind the operations demanding a bitcoin payment (0.01 bitcoins or about $500.57) to receive the decryption key.  In response to the ongoing attacks, the Taiwanese company has released an advisory prompting users to apply updates to QNAP NAS running Multimedia Console, Media Streaming Add-on, and HBS 3 Hybrid Backup Sync to secure the devices from any attacks.   "QNAP strongly urges that all users immediately install the latest Malware Remover version and run a malware scan on QNAP NAS," the company&nbsp; said . "The Multimedia Console, Media Streaming Add-on, and Hybrid Backup Sync apps need to be updated to the latest available version as well to further secure QNAP NAS from ransomware attacks."

SonicWall has addressed three critical security vulnerabilities in its hosted and on-premises email security (ES) product that are being actively exploited in the wild.  Tracked as CVE-2021-20021 and CVE-2021-20022, the&nbsp; flaws &nbsp;were discovered and reported to the company by FireEye's Mandiant subsidiary on March 26, 2021, after the cybersecurity firm detected post-exploitation web shell activity on an internet-accessible system within a customer's environment that had SonicWall's Email Security (ES) application running on a Windows Server 2012 installation.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Thursday issued an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;warning of multiple vulnerabilities in the OpENer&nbsp; EtherNet/IP &nbsp;stack that could expose industrial systems to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, data leaks, and remote code execution.  All OpENer commits and versions prior to February 10, 2021, are affected, although there are no known public exploits that specifically target these vulnerabilities.  The four security flaws were discovered and reported to CISA by researchers Tal Keren and Sharon Brizinov from operational technology security company Claroty. Additionally, a fifth security issue identified by Claroty was previously disclosed by Cisco Talos ( CVE-2020-13556 ) on December 2, 2020.   "An attacker would only need to send crafted ENIP/CIP packets to the device in order to exploit these vulnerabilities," the researchers&nbsp; said .  CVE-2020-13556 concerns an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Ethernet/IP server that could

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple one-click vulnerabilities have been discovered across a variety of popular software applications, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on target systems.  The issues were discovered by Positive Security researchers Fabian Bräunlein and Lukas Euler and affect apps like Telegram, Nextcloud, VLC, LibreOffice, OpenOffice, Bitcoin/Dogecoin Wallets, Wireshark, and Mumble.  "Desktop applications which pass user supplied URLs to be opened by the operating system are frequently vulnerable to code execution with user interaction," the researchers&nbsp; said . "Code execution can be achieved either when a URL pointing to a malicious executable (.desktop, .jar, .exe, …) hosted on an internet accessible file share (nfs, webdav, smb, …) is opened, or an additional vulnerability in the opened application's URI handler is exploited."   Put differently; the flaws stem from an insufficient validation of URL input that, when opened with the help of the u

New WhatsApp Bugs Could've Let Attackers Hack Your Phone Remotely<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/new-whatsapp-bug-couldve-let-attackers.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Facebook-owned WhatsApp recently addressed two security vulnerabilities in its messaging app for Android that could have been exploited to execute malicious code remotely on the device and even compromise encrypted communications.  The flaws take aim at devices running Android versions up to and including Android 9 by carrying out what's known as a "man-in-the-disk" attack that makes it possible for adversaries to compromise an app by manipulating certain data being exchanged between it and the external storage.  "The two aforementioned WhatsApp vulnerabilities would have made it possible for attackers to remotely collect TLS cryptographic material for TLS 1.3 and TLS 1.2 sessions," researchers from Census Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;today.&nbsp;  "With the TLS secrets at hand, we will demonstrate how a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack can lead to the compromise of WhatsApp communications, to remote code execution on the victim device and to the extraction of Noise protocol key

New JavaScript Exploit Can Now Carry Out DDR4 Rowhammer Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/new-javascript-exploit-can-now-carry.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Academics from Vrije University in Amsterdam and ETH Zurich have published a new research paper describing yet another variation of the Rowhammer attack.  Dubbed&nbsp; SMASH &nbsp;(Synchronized MAny-Sided Hammering), the technique can be used to successfully trigger the attack from JavaScript on modern DDR4 RAM cards, notwithstanding extensive mitigations that have been put in place by manufacturers over the last seven years.  "Despite their in-DRAM Target Row Refresh (TRR) mitigations, some of the most recent DDR4 modules are still vulnerable to many-sided Rowhammer bit flips," the researchers said.&nbsp;  "SMASH exploits high-level knowledge of cache replacement policies to generate optimal access patterns for eviction-based many-sided Rowhammer. To bypass the in-DRAM TRR mitigations, SMASH carefully schedules cache hits and misses to successfully trigger synchronized many-sided Rowhammer bit flips."   By synchronizing memory requests with DRAM refresh commands, the researchers

Google on Tuesday released a new version of Chrome web-browsing software for Windows, Mac, and Linux with patches for two newly discovered security vulnerabilities for both of which it says exploits exist in the wild, allowing attackers to engage in active exploitation.  One of the two flaws concerns an insufficient validation of untrusted input in its V8 JavaScript rendering engine (CVE-2021-21220), which was demonstrated by Dataflow Security's Bruno Keith and Niklas Baumstark at the&nbsp; Pwn2Own 2021 &nbsp;hacking contest last week.   While Google moved to fix the flaw quickly, security researcher Rajvardhan Agarwal published a&nbsp; working exploit &nbsp;over the weekend by reverse-engineering the patch that the Chromium team pushed to the open-source component, a factor that may have played a crucial role in the release.  UPDATE: &nbsp; Agarwal, in an email to The Hacker News, confirmed that there's one more vulnerability  affecting Chromium-based browsers that has been patched in the latest vers

In its April slate of patches, Microsoft rolled out fixes for a total of&nbsp; 114 security flaws , including an actively exploited zero-day and four remote code execution bugs in Exchange Server.  Of the&nbsp; 114 flaws , 19 are rated as Critical, 88 are rated Important, and one is rated Moderate in severity.  Chief among them is&nbsp; CVE-2021-28310 , a privilege escalation vulnerability in Win32k that's said to be under active exploitation, allowing attackers to elevate privileges by running malicious code on a target system.&nbsp;  Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which discovered and reported the flaw to Microsoft in February, linked the zero-day exploit to a threat actor named Bitter APT, which was found exploiting a similar flaw ( CVE-2021-1732 ) in attacks late last year.   "It is an escalation of privilege (EoP) exploit that is likely used together with other browser exploits to escape sandboxes or get system privileges for further access," Kaspersky researcher Boris Larin&nbsp; said .

Security researchers have uncovered nine vulnerabilities affecting four TCP/IP stacks impacting more than 100 million consumer and enterprise devices that could be exploited by an attacker to take control of a vulnerable system.  Dubbed " NAME:WRECK " by Forescout and JSOF, the flaws are the latest in series of studies undertaken as part of an initiative called Project Memoria to study the security of widely-used TCP/IP stacks that are incorporated by various vendors in their firmware to offer internet and network connectivity features.  "These vulnerabilities relate to Domain Name System (DNS) implementations, causing either Denial of Service (DoS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to take target devices offline or to take control over them," the researchers said.  The name comes from the fact that parsing of domain names can break (i.e., "wreck") DNS implementations in TCP/IP stacks, adding to a recent uptick in vulnerabilities such as

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Networking equipment major Cisco Systems has said it does not plan to fix a critical security vulnerability affecting some of its Small Business routers, instead urging users to replace the devices.  The bug, tracked as CVE-2021-1459, is rated with a CVSS score of  9.8 out of 10, and affects RV110W VPN firewall and Small Business RV130, RV130W, and RV215W routers, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected appliance.   The flaw, which stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface, could be exploited by a malicious actor to send specially-crafted HTTP requests to the targeted device and achieve remote code execution.  " A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system of the affected device," Cisco&nbsp; said &nbsp;in its advisory.   Security researcher Treck Zhou has been credited with reporting the vulnerability. Although

Android to Support Rust Programming Language to Prevent Memory Flaws<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/android-to-support-rust-programming.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday announced that its open source version of the Android operating system will add support for Rust programming language in a bid to prevent memory safety bugs.  To that end, the company has been building parts of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) with Rust for the past 18 months, with plans in the pipeline to scale this initiative to cover more aspects of the operating system.  "Managed languages like Java and Kotlin are the best option for Android app development," Google&nbsp; said . "The Android OS uses Java extensively, effectively protecting large portions of the Android platform from memory bugs. Unfortunately, for the lower layers of the OS, Java and Kotlin are not an option."   Stating that code written in C and C++ languages requires robust isolation when parsing untrustworthy input, Google said the technique of containing such code within a tightly constrained and unprivileged sandbox can be expensive, causing latency issues and additional

Cyber attackers are actively setting their sights on unsecured SAP applications in an attempt to steal information and sabotage critical processes, according to new research.

A novel technique adopted by attackers finds ways to use Microsoft's Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) so as to deploy malicious payloads on Windows machines stealthily.  In 2020, hospitals, retirement communities, and medical centers bore the brunt of an&nbsp; ever-shifting phishing campaign &nbsp;that distributed custom backdoors such as KEGTAP, which ultimately paved the way for RYUK ransomware attacks.  But new&nbsp; research &nbsp;by FireEye's Mandiant cyber forensics arm has now revealed a previously unknown persistence mechanism that shows the adversaries made use of BITS to launch the backdoor.   Introduced in Windows XP,&nbsp; BITS &nbsp;is a component of Microsoft Windows, which makes use of idle network bandwidth to facilitate the asynchronous transfer of files between machines. This is achieved by creating a job — a container that includes the files to download or upload.  BITS is commonly used to deliver operating system updates to clients as well as by Windows Defender antivirus

New Bugs Could Let Hackers Bypass Spectre Attack Mitigations On Linux Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/new-bugs-could-let-hackers-bypass.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Monday disclosed two new vulnerabilities in Linux-based operating systems that, if successfully exploited, could let attackers circumvent mitigations for speculative attacks such as&nbsp; Spectre &nbsp;and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.  Discovered by&nbsp; Piotr Krysiuk &nbsp;of Symantec's Threat Hunter team, the flaws — tracked as CVE-2020-27170 and CVE-2020-27171 (CVSS scores: 5.5) — impact all Linux kernels prior to 5.11.8. Patches for the security issues were released on March 20, with Ubuntu, Debian, and Red Hat deploying fixes for the vulnerabilities in their respective Linux distributions.  While&nbsp; CVE-2020-27170 &nbsp;can be abused to reveal content from any location within the kernel memory,&nbsp; CVE-2020-27171  can be used to retrieve data from a 4GB range of kernel memory.   First documented in January 2018,&nbsp; Spectre and Meltdown &nbsp;take advantage of flaws in modern processors to&nbsp; leak data &nbsp;that are currently processed on the computer, thereby allowing

The maintainers of OpenSSL have released a fix for two high-severity security flaws in its software that could be exploited to carry out denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and bypass certificate verification.  Tracked as CVE-2021-3449  and CVE-2021-3450 , both the&nbsp; vulnerabilities &nbsp;have been resolved in an update (version OpenSSL 1.1.1k) released on Thursday. While CVE-2021-3449 affects all OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions, CVE-2021-3450 impacts OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer.  OpenSSL is a software library consisting of cryptographic functions that implement the Transport Layer Security protocol with the goal of securing communications sent over a computer network.   According to an advisory published by OpenSSL, CVE-2021-3449 concerns a potential DoS vulnerability arising due to NULL pointer dereferencing that can cause an OpenSSL TLS server to crash if in the course of renegotiation the client transmits a malicious "ClientHello" message during the&nbsp; handshake &nbsp;between the server and

New research into&nbsp; 5G architecture &nbsp;has uncovered a security flaw in its network slicing and virtualized network functions that could be exploited to allow data access and denial of service attacks between different network slices on a mobile operator's 5G network.  AdaptiveMobile shared its findings with the GSM Association (GSMA) on February 4, 2021, following which the weaknesses were collectively designated as CVD-2021-0047.  5G is an evolution of current 4G architectures and is based on what's called a service-based architecture (SBA) that provides a modular framework to deploy a set of interconnected network functions, allowing consumers to discover and authorize their access to a plethora of services.  The network functions are also responsible for registering subscribers, managing sessions and subscriber profiles, storing subscriber data, and connecting the users (UE or user equipment) to the internet via a base station (gNB). What's more, each network function of

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
IT infrastructure management provider SolarWinds on Thursday released a new update to its Orion networking monitoring tool with fixes for four security vulnerabilities, counting two weaknesses that could be exploited by an authenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE).  Chief among them is a JSON deserialization flaw that allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary code via the&nbsp; test alert actions &nbsp;feature available in the Orion Web Console, which lets users simulate network events (e.g., an unresponsive server) that can be configured to trigger an alert during setup. It has been rated critical in severity.   A second issue concerns a high-risk vulnerability that could be leveraged by an adversary to achieve RCE in the Orion Job Scheduler. "In order to exploit this, an attacker first needs to know the credentials of an unprivileged local account on the Orion Server," SolarWinds&nbsp; said &nbsp;in its release notes.  The advisory is light on technical specifics,

The issues concern a total of five security vulnerabilities, three of which (CVE-2021-1411, CVE-2021-1417, and CVE-2021-1418) were reported to the company by Olav Sortland Thoresen of Watchcom, with two others (CVE-2021-1469 and CVE-2021-1471) uncovered during internal security testing.   Cisco notes that the flaws are not dependent on one another, and that exploitation of any one of the vulnerabilities doesn't hinge on the exploitation of another.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has disclosed that a now-patched vulnerability affecting Android devices that use Qualcomm chipsets is being weaponized by attackers to launch targeted attacks.  Tracked as CVE-2020-11261  (CVSS score 8.4), the flaw concerns  an "improper input validation" issue in Qualcomm's Graphics component that could be exploited to trigger memory corruption when an attacker-engineered app requests access to a huge chunk of the device's memory.   "There are indications that CVE-2020-11261 may be under limited, targeted exploitation," the search giant said  in an updated January security bulletin on March 18.  CVE-2020-11261 was discovered and reported to Qualcomm by Google's Android Security team on July 20, 2020, after which it was fixed in January 2021.   It's worth noting that the access vector for the vulnerability is "local," meaning that exploitation requires local access to the device. In other words, to launch a successful attack, the b

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Sunday disclosed multiple critical vulnerabilities in remote student monitoring software Netop Vision Pro &nbsp;that a malicious attacker could abuse to execute arbitrary code and take over Windows computers.  "These findings allow for elevation of privileges and ultimately remote code execution which could be used by a malicious attacker within the same network to gain full control over students' computers," the McAfee Labs Advanced Threat Research team said  in an analysis.  The vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2021-27192, CVE-2021-27193, CVE-2021-27194, and CVE-2021-27195, were reported to Netop on December 11, 2020, after which the Denmark-based company fixed the issues in an update (version 9.7.2) released on February 25.  "Version 9.7.2 of Vision and Vision Pro is a maintenance release that addresses several vulnerabilities, such as escalating local privileges sending sensitive information in plain text," the company stated  in its

Critical RCE Vulnerability Found in Apache OFBiz ERP Software—Patch Now<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/critical-rce-vulnerability-found-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Apache Software Foundation on Friday addressed a high severity vulnerability in Apache OFBiz that could have allowed an unauthenticated adversary to remotely seize control of the open-source enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-26295 , the flaw affects all versions of the software prior to&nbsp; 17.12.06 &nbsp;and employs an "unsafe deserialization" as an attack vector to permit unauthorized remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a server directly.   OFBiz &nbsp;is a Java-based web framework for automating enterprise processes and offers a wide range of functionality, including accounting, customer relationship management, manufacturing operations management, order management, supply chain fulfillment, and warehouse management system, among others.  Specifically, by exploiting this flaw, a malicious party can tamper with serialized data to insert arbitrary code that, when deserialized, can potentially result in remote code execution.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Almost 10 days after application security company F5 Networks&nbsp; released patches &nbsp;for critical vulnerabilities in its BIG-IP and BIG-IQ products, adversaries have begun opportunistically mass scanning and targeting exposed and unpatched networking devices to break into enterprise networks.  News of in the wild exploitation development comes on the heels of a proof-of-concept exploit code that surfaced online earlier this week by reverse-engineering the Java software patch in BIG-IP. The&nbsp; mass scans &nbsp;are said to have spiked since March 18.   The flaws affect BIG-IP versions 11.6 or 12.x and newer, with a critical remote code execution (CVE-2021-22986) also impacting BIG-IQ versions 6.x and 7.x.&nbsp; CVE-2021-22986 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8) is notable for the fact that it's an unauthenticated, remote command execution vulnerability affecting the iControl REST interface, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands, create or delete files, and disable services without the need for a

Critical RCE Flaw Reported in MyBB Forum Software—Patch Your Sites<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/critical-rce-flaw-reported-in-mybb.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A pair of critical vulnerabilities in a popular bulletin board software called MyBB could have been chained together to achieve remote code execution (RCE) without the need for prior access to a privileged account.  The flaws, which were discovered by independent security researchers Simon Scannell and Carl Smith, were reported to the MyBB Team on February 22, following which it&nbsp; released &nbsp;an update (version 1.8.26) on March 10 addressing the issues.  MyBB, formerly MyBBoard and originally MyBulletinBoard, is free and open-source forum software developed using PHP and MySQL.   According to the researchers, the first issue — a nested auto URL persistent XSS vulnerability (CVE-2021-27889) — stems from how MyBB parses messages containing URLs during the rendering process, thus enabling any unprivileged forum user to embed stored XSS payloads into threads, posts, and even private messages.

Why Cached Credentials Can Cause Account Lockouts and How to Stop it<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/why-cached-credentials-can-cause.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
When a user account becomes locked out, the cause is often attributed to a user who has simply entered an old or incorrect password too many times. However, this is far from being the only thing that can cause an account to become locked.  Another common cause, for example, is an application or script that is configured to log into the system using an old password. Perhaps the most easily overlooked cause of account lockouts, however, is the use of cached credentials.  Before I explain&nbsp; why cached credentials can be problematic , let's first consider what the Windows cached credentials do and why they are necessary.  Cached and stored credentials  Cached credentials are a mechanism that is used to ensure that users have a way of logging into their device in the event that the device is unable to access the Active Directory. Suppose for a moment that a user is working from a domain-joined laptop and is connected to the corporate network.  In that type of situation, the Active Directory

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed vulnerabilities in multiple WordPress plugins that, if successfully exploited, could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code and take over a website in certain scenarios.  The flaws were uncovered in&nbsp; Elementor , a website builder plugin used on more than seven million sites, and&nbsp; WP Super Cache , a tool used to serve cached pages of a WordPress site.  According to Wordfence, which discovered the security weaknesses in Elementor, the bug concerns a set of&nbsp; stored cross-site scripting &nbsp;(XSS) vulnerabilities (CVSS score: 6.4), which occurs when a malicious script is injected directly into a vulnerable web application.   In this case, due to a lack of validation of the HTML tags on the server-side, a bad actor can exploit the issues to add executable JavaScript to a post or page via a crafted request.  "Since posts created by contributors are typically reviewed by editors or administrators before publishing, any JavaScript added to one of these posts would

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Wednesday issued a joint advisory warning of active exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange on-premises products by nation-state actors and cybercriminals.  "CISA and FBI assess that adversaries could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise networks, steal information, encrypt data for ransom, or even execute a destructive attack," the agencies&nbsp; said . "Adversaries may also sell access to compromised networks on the dark web."  The attacks have primarily targeted local governments, academic institutions, non-governmental organizations, and business entities in various industry sectors, including agriculture, biotechnology, aerospace, defense, legal services, power utilities, and pharmaceutical, which the agencies say are in line with previous activity conducted by Chinese cyber actors.

Application security company F5 Networks on Wednesday published an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;warning of four critical vulnerabilities impacting multiple products that could result in a denial of service (DoS) attack and even remote code execution on target networks.  The patches concern a total of seven related flaws (from CVE-2021-22986 through CVE-2021-22992),&nbsp; two &nbsp;of&nbsp; which &nbsp;were discovered and reported by Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero in December 2020.   The four critical flaws affect BIG-IP versions 11.6 or 12.x and newer, with CVE-2021-22986 also affecting BIG-IQ versions 6.x and 7.x. F5 said it's not aware of any public exploitation of these issues.  Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a full compromise of vulnerable systems, including the possibility of remote code execution as well as trigger a buffer overflow, leading to a DoS attack.  Urging customers to update their BIG-IP and BIG-IQ deployments to a fixed version as soon as possible, F5 Networks

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has awarded an independent security researcher $50,000 as part of its bug bounty program for reporting a flaw that could have allowed a malicious actor to hijack users' accounts without their knowledge.  Reported by Laxman Muthiyah, the vulnerability aims to brute-force the seven-digit security code that's sent to a user's email address or mobile number to corroborate his (or her) identity before resetting the password in order to recover access to the account.  Put differently, the account takeover scenario is a consequence of privilege escalation stemming from an authentication bypass at an endpoint which is used to verify the codes sent as part of the&nbsp; account recovery process .  The company addressed the issue in November 2020, before details of the flaw came to light on Tuesday.   Although there are encryption barriers and rate-limiting checks designed to prevent an attacker from repeatedly submitting all the 10 million combinations of the codes in an automa

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A popular jailbreaking tool called "unc0ver" has been updated to support iOS 14.3 and earlier releases, thereby making it possible to unlock almost every single iPhone model using a vulnerability that Apple in January disclosed was actively exploited in the wild.  The latest release, dubbed unc0ver v6.0.0, was&nbsp; released &nbsp;on Sunday, according to its lead developer Pwn20wnd, expanding its compatibility to jailbreak any device running iOS 11.0 through iOS 14.3 using a kernel vulnerability, including iOS 12.4.9-12.5.1, 13.5.1-13.7, and 14.0-14.3.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-1782 , the flaw is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the kernel stemming from a race condition that could cause a malicious application to elevate its privileges.   "We wrote our own exploit based on CVE-2021-1782 for #unc0ver to achieve optimal exploit speed and stability," Pwn20wnd&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a separate tweet.  The vulnerability has since been addressed by Apple as part of its iOS and iPadOS 14.4 u

Researchers have uncovered gaps in Amazon's skill vetting process for the Alexa voice assistant ecosystem that could allow a malicious actor to publish a deceptive skill under any arbitrary developer name and even make backend code changes after approval to trick users into giving up sensitive information.  The findings were presented on Wednesday at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) conference by a group of academics from Ruhr-Universität Bochum and the North Carolina State University, who analyzed 90,194 skills available in seven countries, including the US, the UK, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, and France.  Amazon Alexa allows third-party developers to create additional functionality for devices such as Echo smart speakers by configuring "skills" that run on top of the voice assistant, thereby making it easy for users to initiate a conversation with the skill and complete a specific task.&nbsp;   Chief among the findings is the concern that

The bug, tracked as CVE-2021-1388, ranks 10 (out of 10) on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system and stems from an improper token validation in an API endpoint of Cisco ACI MSO installed the Application Services Engine.

VMware has addressed multiple critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi and vSphere Client virtual infrastructure management platform that may allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands and take control of affected systems.  "A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in its advisory.  The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-21972, has a CVSS score of 9.8 out of a maximum of 10, making it critical in severity.   "In our opinion, the RCE vulnerability in the vCenter Server can pose no less a threat than the infamous vulnerability in Citrix (CVE-2019-19781)," said Positive Technologies' Mikhail Klyuchnikov, who discovered and reported the flaw to VMware.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malvertising group known as "ScamClub" exploited a zero-day vulnerability in WebKit-based browsers to inject malicious payloads that redirected users to fraudulent websites gift card scams.  The attacks, first spotted  by ad security firm Confiant in late June 2020, leveraged a bug (CVE-2021–1801) that allowed malicious parties to bypass the iframe  sandboxing policy in the browser engine that powers Safari and Google Chrome for iOS and run malicious code.   Specifically, the technique exploited the manner how WebKit handles JavaScript event listeners , thus making it possible to break out of the sandbox associated with an ad's inline frame element despite the presence of "allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" attribute that explicitly forbids any redirection unless the click event occurs inside the iframe.  To test this hypothesis, the researchers set about creating a simple HTML file containing a cross-origin sandboxed iframe and a button outside it that

Unpatched ShareIT Android App Flaw Could Let Hackers Inject Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/unpatched-shareit-android-app-flaw.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple unpatched vulnerabilities have been discovered in SHAREit , a popular app with over one billion downloads, that could be abused to leak a user's sensitive data, execute arbitrary code, and possibly lead to remote code execution.  The findings come from cybersecurity firm Trend Micro's analysis of the Android version of the app, which allows users to share or transfer files between devices.  But in a worrisome twist, the flaws are yet to be patched by Smart Media4U Technology Pte. Ltd., the Singapore-based developer of the app, despite responsible disclosure three months ago.  "We decided to disclose our research three months after reporting this since many users might be affected by this attack because the attacker can steal sensitive data and do anything with the apps' permission," Trend Micro researcher Echo Duan&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up. "It is also not easily detectable."   One of the flaws arises from the manner the app facilitates sharing of

A Sticker Sent On Telegram Could Have Exposed Your Secret Chats<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/a-sticker-sent-on-telegram-could-have.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Monday disclosed details of a now-patched flaw in the Telegram messaging app that could have exposed users' secret messages, photos, and videos to remote malicious actors.  The issues were discovered by Italy-based Shielder in iOS, Android, and macOS versions of the app. Following responsible disclosure, Telegram addressed them in a series of patches on September 30 and October 2, 2020.  The flaws stemmed from the way secret chat functionality operates and in the app's handling of&nbsp; animated stickers , thus allowing attackers to send malformed stickers to unsuspecting users and gain access to messages, photos, and videos that were exchanged with their Telegram contacts through both classic and secret chats.   One caveat of note is that exploiting the flaws in the wild may not have been trivial, as it requires chaining the aforementioned weaknesses to at least one additional vulnerability in order to get around security defenses in modern devices tod

Secret Chat in Telegram Left Self-Destructing Media Files On Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/secret-chat-in-telegram-left-self.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Popular messaging app Telegram fixed a privacy-defeating bug in its macOS app that made it possible to access self-destructing audio and video messages long after they disappeared from secret chats.  The vulnerability was&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;by security researcher Dhiraj Mishra in version 7.3 of the app, who disclosed his findings to Telegram on December 26, 2020. The issue has since been resolved in&nbsp; version 7.4 , released on January 29.  Unlike Signal or WhatsApp, conversations on Telegram by default are not end-to-end encrypted, unless users explicitly opt to enable a device-specific feature called " secret chat ," which keeps data encrypted even on Telegram servers.

With the secret chat

Apple Patches 10-Year-Old macOS SUDO Root Privilege Escalation Bug<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/apple-patches-10-year-old-macos-sudo.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple has rolled out a fix for a critical sudo vulnerability in macOS Big Sur, Catalina, and Mojave that could allow unauthenticated local users to gain root-level privileges on the system.  "A local attacker may be able to elevate their privileges," Apple&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a security advisory. "This issue was addressed by updating to sudo version 1.9.5p2."  Sudo is a common utility built into most Unix and Linux operating systems that lets a user without security privileges access and run a program with the credentials of another user.  Tracked as CVE-2021-3156  (also called " Baron Samedit "), the vulnerability first came to light last month after security auditing firm Qualys&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;the existence of a heap-based buffer overflow, which it said had been "hiding in plain sight" for almost 10 years.   The vulnerability, which was introduced in the code back in July 2011, impacts sudo versions 1.7.7 through 1.7.10p9, 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2, and 1.9.0

Cisco has rolled out fixes for multiple critical vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Small Business routers that could potentially allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on an affected device.  The&nbsp; flaws &nbsp;— tracked from CVE-2021-1289 through CVE-2021-1295 (CVSS score 9.8) — impact RV160, RV160W, RV260, RV260P, and RV260W VPN routers running a firmware release earlier than Release 1.0.01.02.  Along with the aforementioned three vulnerabilities, patches have also been released for two more&nbsp; arbitrary file write flaws &nbsp;(CVE-2021-1296 and CVE-2021-1297) affecting the same set of VPN routers that could have made it possible for an adversary to overwrite arbitrary files on the vulnerable system.   All the nine security issues were reported to the networking equipment maker by security researcher Takeshi Shiomitsu, who has previously uncovered&nbsp; similar critical flaws &nbsp;in RV110W, RV130W, and RV215W Routers that could be lever

Critical Bugs Found in Popular Realtek Wi-Fi Module for Embedded Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/critical-bugs-found-in-popular-realtek.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Major vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Realtek RTL8195A Wi-Fi module that could have been exploited to gain root access and take complete control of a device's wireless communications.  The six flaws were&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by researchers from Israeli IoT security firm Vdoo.  The&nbsp; Realtek RTL8195A &nbsp;module is a standalone, low-power-consumption Wi-Fi hardware module targeted at embedded devices used in several industries such as agriculture, smart home, healthcare, gaming, and automotive sectors.  It also makes use of an "Ameba" API, allowing developers to communicate with the device via Wi-Fi, HTTP, and&nbsp; MQTT , a lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices.   Although the issues uncovered by Vdoo were verified only on RTL8195A, the researchers said they extend to other modules as well, including RTL8711AM, RTL8711AF, and RTL8710AF.  The flaws concern a mix of stack overflow, and out-of-bounds reads that stem from the Wi-Fi module's WPA2&nbsp; fo

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed three severe security vulnerabilities impacting SolarWinds products, the most severe of which could have been exploited to achieve remote code execution with elevated privileges.  Two of the flaws (CVE-2021-25274 and CVE-2021-25275) were identified in the SolarWinds Orion Platform, while a third separate weakness (CVE-2021-25276) was found in the company's Serv-U FTP server for Windows,&nbsp; said &nbsp;cybersecurity firm Trustwave in technical analysis.  None of the three security issues have been exploited in the unprecedented&nbsp; supply chain attack &nbsp;targeting the Orion Platform that came to light last December.   The two sets of vulnerabilities in Orion and Serv-U FTP were disclosed to SolarWinds on December 30, 2020, and January 4, 2021, respectively, following which the company resolved the issues on January 22 and January 25.  It's highly recommended that users install the latest versions of&nbsp; Orion Platform &nbsp;and Serv-U FTP ( 15.2.2 Ho

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A "severe" vulnerability in GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG)'s Libgcrypt encryption software&nbsp;could have allowed an attacker to write arbitrary data to the target machine, potentially leading to remote code execution.  The flaw, which affects version 1.9.0 of libgcrypt, was discovered on January 28 by Tavis Ormandy of Project Zero, a security research unit within Google dedicated to finding zero-day bugs in hardware and software systems.  No other versions of Libgcrypt are affected by the vulnerability.  "There is a&nbsp; heap buffer overflow &nbsp;in libgcrypt due to an incorrect assumption in the block buffer management code," Ormandy&nbsp; said . "Just decrypting some data can overflow a heap buffer with attacker controlled data, no verification or signature is validated before the vulnerability occurs."   GnuPG addressed the weakness almost immediately within a day after disclosure, while urging users to&nbsp; stop using &nbsp;the vulnerable version. The latest version can be dow

Cybersecurity researchers today disclosed an unpatched vulnerability in Microsoft Azure Functions that could be used by an attacker to escalate privileges and escape the Docker container used for hosting them.  The findings come as part of Intezer Lab 's investigations into the Azure compute infrastructure.  Following disclosure to Microsoft, the Windows maker is said to have "determined that the vulnerability has no security impact on Function users, since the host itself is still protected by another defense boundary against the elevated position we reached in the container host."   Azure Functions , analogous to Amazon AWS Lambda, is a serverless solution that allows users to run event-triggered code without having to provision or manage infrastructure explicitly while simultaneously making it possible to scale and allocate compute and resources based on demand.  By incorporating Docker into the mix, it makes it possible for developers to easily deploy and run Azure F

Newly discovered security vulnerabilities in ADT's Blue (formerly LifeShield) home security cameras could have been exploited to hijack both audio and video streams.  The&nbsp; vulnerabilities &nbsp;(tracked as CVE-2020-8101) were identified in the video doorbell camera by Bitdefender researchers in February 2020 before they were eventually addressed on August 17, 2020.  LifeShield was acquired by Florida-based ADT Inc. in 2019, with Lifeshield's DIY home security solutions rebranded as Blue as of January 2020. The company's products had a 33.6% market share in the U.S. last year.   The security issues in the doorbell camera allow an attacker to   Obtain the administrator password of the camera by simply knowing its MAC address, which is used to identify a device uniquely  Inject commands locally to gain root access, and  Access audio and video feeds using an unprotected&nbsp; RTSP &nbsp;(Real-Time Streaming Protocol) server   The doorbell is designed to periodically send heartbeat messages t

Apple on Tuesday released updates for iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS with fixes for three security vulnerabilities that it says may have been actively exploited in the wild.  Reported by an anonymous researcher, the three&nbsp; zero-day &nbsp; flaws &nbsp;— CVE-2021-1782, CVE-2021-1870, and CVE-2021-1871 — could have allowed an attacker to elevate privileges and achieve remote code execution.  The iPhone maker did not disclose how widespread the attack was or reveal the identities of the attackers actively exploiting them.   While the privilege escalation bug in the kernel (CVE-2021-1782) was noted as a race condition that could cause a malicious application to elevate its privileges, the other two shortcomings — dubbed a "logic issue" — were discovered in the WebKit browser engine (CVE-2021-1870 and CVE-2021-1871), permitting an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution inside Safari.  Apple said the race condition and the WebKit flaws were addressed with improved locking and restrictions, resp

Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed a now-patched security flaw in TikTok that could have potentially enabled an attacker to build a database of the app's users and their associated phone numbers for future malicious activity.  Although this flaw only impacts those users who have linked a phone number with their account or logged in with a phone number, successful exploitation of the vulnerability could have resulted in data leakage and privacy violation, Check Point Research said in an analysis  shared with The Hacker News.  TikTok has deployed a fix to address the shortcoming following responsible disclosure from Check Point researchers.   The newly discovered bug resides in TikTok's " Find friends " feature that allows users to sync their contacts with the service to identify potential people to follow.  The contacts are uploaded to TikTok via an HTTP request in the form of a list that consists of hashed contact names and the corresponding phone numbers

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More details have emerged about a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows NT LAN Manager ( NTLM ) that was addressed by Microsoft as part of its monthly&nbsp; Patch Tuesday updates &nbsp;earlier this month.  The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-1678 &nbsp;(CVSS score 4.3), was described as a "remotely exploitable" flaw found in a vulnerable component bound to the network stack, although exact details of the flaw remained unknown.  Now according to researchers from Crowdstrike, the security bug, if left unpatched, could allow a bad actor to achieve remote code execution via an NTLM relay.   "This vulnerability allows an attacker to relay NTLM authentication sessions to an attacked machine, and use a printer spooler&nbsp; MSRPC &nbsp;interface to remotely execute code on the attacked machine," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Friday advisory.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have warned of a publicly available fully-functional exploit that could be used to target SAP enterprise software.  The exploit leverages a vulnerability, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2020-6207 , that stems from a missing authentication check in SAP Solution Manager (SolMan) version 7.2  SAP&nbsp; SolMan &nbsp;is an application management and administration solution that offers end-to-end application lifecycle management in distributed environments, acting as a centralized hub for implementing and maintaining SAP systems such as ERP, CRM, HCM, SCM, BI, and others.   "A successful exploitation could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute highly privileged administrative tasks in the connected&nbsp; SAP SMD Agents ," researchers from Onapsis&nbsp; said , referring to the Solution Manager Diagnostics toolset used to analyze and monitor SAP systems.

Amazon has addressed a number of flaws in its Kindle e-reader platform that could have allowed an attacker to take control of victims' devices by simply sending them a malicious e-book.  Dubbed " KindleDrip ," the exploit chain takes advantage of a feature called " Send to Kindle " to send a malware-laced document to a Kindle device that, when opened, could be leveraged to remotely execute arbitrary code on the device and make unauthorized purchases.  "The code runs as root, and the attacker only needs to know the email address assigned to the victim's device,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Yogev Bar-On, a security researcher for Readlmode Labs, in a technical write-up on Thursday.  The first vulnerability lets a bad actor send an e-book to a Kindle, the second flaw allows for remote code execution while the e-book is parsed, and a third issue makes it possible to escalate privileges and run the code as the "root" user.   When linked together, these weaknesses

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In January 2019, a&nbsp; critical flaw &nbsp;was reported in Apple's FaceTime group chats feature that made it possible for users to initiate a FaceTime video call and eavesdrop on targets by adding their own number as a third person in a group chat even before the person on the other end accepted the incoming call.  The vulnerability was deemed so severe that the iPhone maker removed the FaceTime group chats feature altogether before the issue was resolved in a subsequent iOS update.  Since then, a number of similar shortcomings have been discovered in multiple video chat apps such as Signal, JioChat, Mocha, Google Duo, and Facebook Messenger — all thanks to the work of Google Project Zero researcher Natalie Silvanovich.  "While [the Group FaceTime] bug was soon fixed, the fact that such a serious and easy to reach vulnerability had occurred due to a logic bug in a calling state machine — an attack scenario I had never seen considered on any platform — made me wonder whether other sta

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered multiple vulnerabilities in Dnsmasq, a popular open-source software used for caching Domain Name System (DNS) responses, thereby potentially allowing an adversary to mount DNS&nbsp; cache poisoning attacks &nbsp;and remotely execute malicious code.  The flaws, collectively called "DNSpooq" by Israeli research firm JSOF, echoes previously disclosed weaknesses in the DNS architecture, making Dnsmasq servers powerless against a range of attacks.  "We found that Dnsmasq is vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning attack by an off-path attacker (i.e., an attacker that does not observe the communication between the DNS forwarder and the DNS server)," the researchers noted in a report published today.  "Our attack allows for poisoning of multiple domain names at once, and is a result of several vulnerabilities found. The attack can be completed successfully under seconds or few minutes, and have no special requirements. We also found that many

Introduced in 2014,&nbsp; CAPTCHAs &nbsp;(or Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a type of challenge-response test designed to protect against automated account creation and service abuse by presenting users with a question that is easy for humans to solve but difficult for computers.  reCAPTCHA &nbsp;is a popular version of the CAPTCHA technology that was acquired by Google in 2009.

Zyxel has released a patch to address a critical vulnerability in its firmware concerning a hardcoded undocumented secret account that could be abused by an attacker to login with administrative privileges and compromise its networking devices.  The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2020-29583 &nbsp;(CVSS score 7.8), affects&nbsp; version 4.60 &nbsp;present in wide-range of Zyxel devices, including Unified Security Gateway (USG), USG FLEX, ATP, and VPN firewall products.   EYE researcher&nbsp; Niels Teusink &nbsp;reported the vulnerability to Zyxel on November 29, following which the company released a firmware patch (ZLD V4.60 Patch1) on December 18.  According to the&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;published by Zyxel, the undocumented account ("zyfwp") comes with an unchangeable password (" PrOw!aN_fXp ") that's not only stored in plaintext but could also be used by a malicious third-party to login to the SSH server or web interface with admin privileges.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has patched a bug in its feedback tool incorporated across its services that could be exploited by an attacker to potentially steal screenshots of sensitive Google Docs documents simply by embedding them in a malicious website.  The flaw was discovered on July 9 by security researcher&nbsp; Sreeram KL , for which he was awarded $3133.70 as part of Google's Vulnerability Reward Program.   Many of Google's products, including Google Docs, come with a " Send feedback " or "Help Docs improve" option that allows users to send feedback along with an option to include a screenshot — something that's automatically loaded to highlight specific issues.  But instead of having to duplicate the same functionality across its services, the feedback feature is deployed in Google's main website ("www.google.com") and integrated to other domains via an iframe element that loads the pop-up's content from "feedback.googleusercontent.com."

Google's Project Zero team has made public details of an improperly patched zero-day security vulnerability in Windows print spooler API that could be leveraged by a bad actor to execute arbitrary code.  Details of the flaw were revealed after Microsoft failed to patch it within 90 days of responsible disclosure on September 24.  Originally tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2020-0986 , the flaw concerns an elevation of privilege exploits in the GDI Print /&nbsp; Print Spooler &nbsp;API ("splwow64.exe") that was reported to Microsoft by an anonymous user working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) back in late December 2019.   But with no patch in sight for about six months, ZDI ended up posting a public&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;as a zero-day on May 19 earlier this year, after which it was&nbsp; exploited &nbsp;in the wild in a campaign dubbed " Operation PowerFall " against an unnamed South Korean company.

The US Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; warned &nbsp;of critical vulnerabilities in a low-level TCP/IP software library developed by Treck that, if weaponized, could allow remote attackers to run arbitrary commands and mount denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  The four flaws affect Treck TCP/IP stack version 6.0.1.67 and earlier and were reported to the company by Intel. Two of these are rated critical in severity.  Treck's embedded TCP/IP stack is deployed worldwide in manufacturing, information technology, healthcare, and transportation systems.   The most severe of them is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability ( CVE-2020-25066 ) in the Treck HTTP Server component that could permit an adversary to crash or reset the target device and even execute remote code. It has a CVSS score of 9.8 out of a maximum of 10.  The second flaw is an out-of-bounds write in the IPv6 component ( CVE-2020-27337 , CVSS score 9.1) that could be exploited by an unauthenticated

A team of researchers today unveils two critical security vulnerabilities it discovered in Dell Wyse Thin clients that could have potentially allowed attackers to remotely execute malicious code and access arbitrary files on affected devices.  The flaws, which were uncovered  by healthcare cybersecurity provider CyberMDX and reported to Dell in June 2020, affects all devices running ThinOS versions 8.6 and below.  Dell has addressed both the vulnerabilities in an&nbsp; update &nbsp;released today. The flaws also have a CVSS score of 10 out of 10, making them critical in severity.  Thin clients are typically computers that run from resources stored on a central server instead of a localized hard drive. They work by establishing a remote connection to the server, which takes care of launching and running applications and storing relevant data.  Tracked as CVE-2020-29491  and CVE-2020-29492 , the security shortcomings in Wyse's thin clients stem from the fact that the FTP sessions used to pull

Everyone makes mistakes. That one sentence was drummed into me in my very first job in tech, and it has held true since then. In the cybersecurity world, misconfigurations can create exploitable issues that can haunt us later - so let's look at a few common security misconfigurations.

The issues arise when security reviews aren't carefully performed prior to pushing the code live, no matter if that push is for the initial launch of a platform or for updates.  The result is straight-forward; a bucket goes live with the ability for anyone to read and write to and from it.
