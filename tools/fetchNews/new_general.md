Unifying Security Tech Beyond the Stack: Integrating SecOps with Managed Risk and Strategy<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/01/unifying-security-tech-beyond-stack.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity is an infinite journey in a digital landscape that never ceases to change. According to Ponemon Institute 1 , "only 59% of organizations say their cybersecurity strategy has changed over the past two years." This stagnation in strategy adaptation can be traced back to several key issues. Talent Retention Challenges: &nbsp;The cybersecurity field is rapidly advancing, requiring a skilled and knowledgeable workforce. However, organizations face a critical shortage of such talent, making it difficult to keep strategies agile and relevant. Leadership Focus : Often, the attention of leadership teams is divided across various priorities, and cybersecurity may not be at the forefront. This can result in strategies becoming outdated and less effective. Board Engagement: &nbsp;Adequate board support is essential for strategy evolution. A lack of comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity issues at the board level can lead to insufficient resources and support for strategic updates.

John Hanley of IBM Security shares 4 key findings from the highly acclaimed annual Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023 What is the IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report? The IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report is an annual report that provides organizations with quantifiable information about the financial impacts of breaches. With this data, they can make data driven decisions about how they implement security in their organization. The report is conducted by the Ponemon Institute and sponsored, analyzed, and published by IBM Security. In 2023, the 18th year the report was published, the report analyzed 553 breaches across 16 countries and 17 industries. According to Etay Maor, Senior Director of Security Strategy at&nbsp; Cato Networks , "We tend to talk a lot about security issues and solutions. This report puts a number behind threats and solutions and provides a lot of information to support claims of how a threat actor, a solution or a process impacts you financially." Key Finding #1: The

Some of you have already started budgeting for 2024 and allocating funds to security areas within your organization. It is safe to say that employee security awareness training is one of the expenditure items, too. However, its effectiveness is an open question with people still engaging in insecure behaviors at the workplace. Besides, social engineering remains one of the most prevalent attacks, followed by a successful data breach.&nbsp; Microsoft found &nbsp;that a popular form of video-based training reduces phish-clicking behavior by about 3%, at best. This number has been stable over the years, says Microsoft, while phishing attacks are increasing yearly.&nbsp; Regardless, organizations have faith in training and tend to increase their security investments in employee training after attacks. It comes second in the priority list for 51% of organizations, right after incident response planning and testing, according to the IBM Security&nbsp; "Cost of the Data Breach Report 2023" .&nbsp; So, wh

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Over the past few years, SaaS has developed into the backbone of corporate IT. Service businesses, such as medical practices, law firms, and financial services firms, are almost entirely SaaS based. Non-service businesses, including manufacturers and retailers, have about 70% of their software in the cloud.&nbsp; These applications contain a wealth of data, from minimally sensitive general corporate information to highly sensitive intellectual property, customer records, and employee data. Threat actors have noted this shift, and are actively working to breach apps to access the data. Here are the top trends influencing the state of SaaS Security for 2024 — and what you can do about it.&nbsp; Democratization of SaaS&nbsp; SaaS apps have transformed the way organizations purchase and use software.

Low-code/no-code (LCNC) and robotic process automation (RPA) have gained immense popularity, but how secure are they? Is your security team paying enough attention in an era of rapid digital transformation, where business users are empowered to create applications swiftly using platforms like Microsoft PowerApps, UiPath, ServiceNow, Mendix, and OutSystems? The simple truth is often swept under the rug. While low-code/no-code (LCNC) apps and robotic process automations (RPA) drive efficiency and agility, their dark security side demands scrutiny. LCNC application security emerges as a relatively new frontier, and even seasoned security practitioners and security teams grapple with the dynamic nature and sheer volume of citizen-developed applications. The accelerated pace of LCNC development poses a unique challenge for security professionals, underscoring the need for dedicated efforts and solutions to effectively address the security nuances of low-code development environments.

2023 has seen its fair share of cyber attacks, however there's one attack vector that proves to be more prominent than others - non-human access.

Threat actors look for the path of least resistance, and it seems that in 2023 this path was non-user access credentials (API keys, tokens, service accounts and secrets).&nbsp; " 50% of the active access tokens connecting Salesforce and third-party apps are unused. In GitHub and GCP the numbers reach 33%." These non-user access credentials are used to connect apps and resources to other cloud services.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Compromising the browser is a high-return target for adversaries. Browser extensions, which are small software modules that are added to the browser and can enhance browsing experiences, have become a popular browser attack vector. This is because they are widely adopted among users and can easily turn malicious through developer actions or attacks on legitimate extensions. Recent incidents like&nbsp; DataSpii &nbsp;and the&nbsp; Nigelthorn &nbsp;malware attack have exposed the extent of damage that malicious extensions can inflict. In both cases, users innocently installed extensions that compromised their privacy and security. The underlying issue lies in the permissions granted to extensions. These permissions, often excessive and lacking granularity, allow attackers to exploit them. What can organizations do to protect themselves from the risks of browser extensions without barring them from use altogether (an act that would be nearly impossible to enforce)?&nbsp; A new report by LayerX, "Unveiling the

As work ebbs with the typical end-of-year slowdown, now is a good time to review user roles and privileges and remove anyone who shouldn't have access as well as trim unnecessary permissions.

First, they are removed from the company's identity provider (IdP), which kicks off an automated workflow that deactivates their email and removes access to all internal systems. When enterprises use an SSO (single sign-on), these former employees lose access to any online properties – including SaaS applications – that require SSO for login.&nbsp; However, that doesn't mean that former employee

SOC teams tend to spend about a&nbsp; third of their day &nbsp;on events that don't pose any threat to their organization, and this has accelerated the adoption of automated solutions to take the place of (or augment) inefficient and cumbersome SIEMs. With an estimated&nbsp; 80% of these threats &nbsp;being common across most organizations, today's SOCs are able to confidently rely on automation to cover this large percentage of threat signals.&nbsp; But, while it is true that automation can greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of security teams, it will never be able to cover all detection and response use cases infallibly.&nbsp; In the recently released&nbsp; GigaOm Radar for Autonomous Security Operations Center (SOC) , they accurately state that "the SOC will not—and should not—be fully autonomous."&nbsp; As more vendors attempt to challenge the dominant players in the SIEM c

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Numerous industries—including technology, financial services, energy, healthcare, and government—are rushing to incorporate cloud-based and containerized web applications.&nbsp; The benefits are undeniable; however, this shift presents new security challenges.&nbsp; OPSWAT's 2023 Web Application Security report &nbsp;reveals: 75% of organizations have modernized their infrastructure this year. 78% have increased their security budgets. Yet just 2% are confident in their security posture. Let's explore why confidence in security lags infrastructure upgrades and how OPSWAT closes that gap. Evolving Infrastructure Outpaces Security Upgrades. The pace of security upgrades struggles to keep up with technological advancements. This gap is especially visible in file upload security. Companies are updating their infrastructure by embracing distributed, scalable applications that leverage microservices and cloud solutions—creating new avenues of attack for criminals.

ChatGPT: Productivity tool, great for writing poems, and… a security risk?! In this article, we show how threat actors can exploit ChatGPT, but also how defenders can use it for leveling up their game. ChatGPT is the most swiftly growing consumer application to date. The extremely popular generative AI chatbot has the ability to generate human-like, coherent and contextually relevant responses. This makes it very valuable for applications like content creation, coding, education, customer support, and even personal assistance. However, ChatGPT also comes with security risks. ChatGPT can be used for data exfiltration, spreading misinformation, developing cyber attacks and writing phishing emails. On the flip side, it can help defenders who can use it for identifying vulnerabilities and learning about various defenses.

Here is what matters most when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity: Outcomes.&nbsp; As the threat landscape evolves and&nbsp; generative AI is added &nbsp;to the toolsets available to defenders and attackers alike, evaluating the relative effectiveness of various&nbsp; AI-based security &nbsp;offerings is increasingly important — and difficult. Asking the right questions can help you spot solutions that deliver value and ROI, instead of just marketing hype. Questions like, "Can your predictive AI tools sufficiently block what's new?" and, "What actually signals success in a cybersecurity platform powered by artificial intelligence?" As BlackBerry's AI and ML (machine learning) patent portfolio attests, BlackBerry is a leader in this space and has developed an exceptionally well-informed point of view on what works and why.

Google has announced that it's expanding its Vulnerability Rewards Program ( VRP ) to compensate researchers for finding attack scenarios tailored to generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems in an effort to&nbsp; bolster AI safety and security . "Generative AI raises new and different concerns than traditional digital security, such as the potential for unfair bias, model manipulation or misinterpretations of data (hallucinations)," Google's Laurie Richardson and Royal Hansen&nbsp; said . Some of the categories that are in scope&nbsp; include &nbsp;prompt injections, leakage of sensitive data from training datasets, model manipulation, adversarial perturbation attacks that trigger misclassification, and model theft. It's worth noting that Google earlier this July instituted an&nbsp; AI Red Team &nbsp;to help address threats to AI systems as part of its Secure AI Framework ( SAIF ).

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The time between a vulnerability being discovered and hackers exploiting it is narrower than ever –&nbsp; just 12 days . So it makes sense that organizations are starting to recognize the importance of not leaving long gaps between their scans, and the term "continuous vulnerability scanning" is becoming more popular. Hackers won't wait for your next scan One-off scans can be a simple 'one-and-done' scan to prove your security posture to customers, auditors or investors, but more commonly they refer to periodic scans kicked off at semi-regular intervals – the industry standard has traditionally been quarterly. These periodic scans give you a point-in-time snapshot of your vulnerability status – from SQL injections and XSS to misconfigurations and weak passwords. Great for compliance if they only ask for a quarterly vulnerability scan, but not so good for ongoing oversight of your security posture, or a robust attack surface management program.

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, attackers are always searching for vulnerabilities and exploits within organizational environments. They don't just target single weaknesses; they're on the hunt for combinations of exposures and attack methods that can lead them to their desired objective. Despite the presence of numerous security tools, organizations often have to deal with two major challenges; First, these tools frequently lack the ability to effectively prioritize threats, leaving security professionals in the dark about which issues need immediate attention. Second, these tools often fail to provide context about how individual issues come together and how they can be leveraged by attackers to access critical assets. This lack of insight can lead organizations to either attempt to fix everything or, more dangerously, address nothing at all.

In what's the latest evolution of threat actors abusing legitimate infrastructure for nefarious ends, new findings show that nation-state hacking groups have entered the fray in leveraging the social platform for targeting critical infrastructure. Discord, in recent years, has become a lucrative target, acting as a fertile ground for&nbsp; hosting malware &nbsp;using its content delivery network (CDN) as well as allowing information stealers to&nbsp; siphon sensitive data &nbsp;off the app and&nbsp; facilitating data exfiltration &nbsp;by means of webhooks. "The usage of Discord is largely limited to information stealers and grabbers that anyone can buy or download from the Internet," Trellix researchers Ernesto Fernández Provecho and David Pastor Sanz&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday report.

Certain online risks to children are on the rise, according to a recent report from Thorn , a technology nonprofit whose mission is to build technology to defend children from sexual abuse. Research shared in the&nbsp; Emerging Online Trends in Child Sexual Abuse 2023 report , indicates that minors are increasingly taking and sharing sexual images of themselves. This activity may occur consensually or coercively, as youth also report an increase in risky online interactions with adults. "In our digitally connected world, child sexual abuse material is easily and increasingly shared on the platforms we use in our daily lives," said John Starr, VP of Strategic Impact at Thorn. "Harmful interactions between youth and adults are not isolated to the dark corners of the web. As fast as the digital community builds innovative platforms, predators are co-opting these spaces to exploit children and share this egregious content."

The landscape of browser security has undergone significant changes over the past decade. While Browser Isolation was once considered the gold standard for protecting against browser exploits and malware downloads, it has become increasingly inadequate and insecure in today's SaaS-centric world. The limitations of Browser Isolation, such as degraded browser performance and inability to tackle modern web-borne threats like phishing and malicious extensions, necessitate a shift towards more advanced solutions. These are the findings of a new report, titled " The Dark Side of Browser Isolation and the Next Generation of Browser Security " ( Download here ). The Roots of Browser Isolation In the past, traditional signature-based antiviruses were commonly used to protect against on-device malware infections. However, they failed to block two main types of threats. The first, browser exploit, especially in Microsoft's Internet Explorer. The second, drive-by malware down

Weak password policies leave organizations vulnerable to attacks. But are the standard password complexity requirements enough to secure them?&nbsp; 83% of compromised passwords &nbsp;would satisfy the password complexity and length requirements of compliance standards. That's because bad actors already have access to billions of stolen credentials that can be used to compromise additional accounts by reusing those same credentials. To strengthen password security, organizations need to look beyond complexity requirements and block the use of compromised credentials. Need stolen credentials? There's a market for that Every time an organization gets breached or a subset of customers' credentials is stolen, there's a high possibility all those passwords end up for sale on the dark web. Remember the&nbsp; Dropbox and LinkedIn hack &nbsp;that resulted in 71 million and 117 million stolen passwords?

Well, you shouldn't. It may already be hiding vulnerabilities. It's the modular nature of modern web applications that has made them so effective. They can call on dozens of third-party web components, JS frameworks, and open-source tools to deliver all the different functionalities that keep their customers happy, but this chain of dependencies is also what makes them so vulnerable. Many of those components in the web application supply chain are controlled by a third party—the company that created them. This means that no matter how rigorous you were with your own static code analysis, code reviews, penetration testing, and other SSDLC processes, most of your supply chain's security is in the hands of whoever built its third-party components. With their huge potential for weak spots, and their widespread use in the lucrative ecommerce, financial and medical industries, web application supply chains present a juicy target for cyber attackers.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
IBM's 2023 installment of their annual " Cost of a Breach " report has thrown up some interesting trends. Of course, breaches being costly is no longer news at this stage! What's interesting is the difference in how organizations respond to threats and which technologies are helping reduce the costs associated with every IT team's nightmare scenario.&nbsp; The average cost of a breach rose once again to $4.45 million, increasing 15% over the last three years. Costs associated with escalation and detection have rocketed up 42% during the same period. With that in mind, I was surprised to learn that only 51% of the breached entities surveyed by IBM decided to bolster their security investments, despite the rising financial consequences of dealing with a breach. Headline stats around breach costs are interesting – but can digging into these trends actually help you save money? Organizations want to know where to invest their security budget and which technologies offer the bes

There's been a great deal of AI hype recently, but that doesn't mean the robots are here to replace us. This article sets the record straight and explains how businesses should approach AI. From musing about self-driving cars to fearing AI bots that could destroy the world, there has been a great deal of AI hype in the past few years. AI has captured our imaginations, dreams, and occasionally, our nightmares. However, the reality is that AI is currently much less advanced than we anticipated it would be by now. Autonomous cars, for example, often considered the poster child of AI's limitless future, represent a narrow use case and are not yet a common application across all transportation sectors. In this article, we de-hype AI, provide tools for businesses approaching AI and share information to help stakeholders educate themselves.&nbsp; AI Terminology De-Hyped AI vs. ML AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) are terms that are often used interchangeably, but the

Cybersecurity and intelligence agencies from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. on Thursday disclosed details of a mobile malware strain targeting Android devices used by the Ukrainian military. The malicious software, dubbed&nbsp; Infamous Chisel &nbsp;and attributed to a Russian state-sponsored actor called Sandworm, has&nbsp; capabilities &nbsp;to "enable unauthorized access to compromised devices, scan files, monitor traffic, and periodically steal sensitive information." Some aspects of the malware were&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) earlier in August, highlighting unsuccessful attempts on part of the adversary to penetrate Ukrainian military networks and gather valuable intelligence. It's said that Russian forces captured tablets used by Ukraine on the battlefield, using them as a foothold to remotely disseminate the malware to other devices by using the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ) command-line tool. Sandworm, also known by the names FROZENBARENTS, Ir

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing attack likely targeting civil society groups in South Korea has led to the discovery of a novel remote access trojan called&nbsp; SuperBear . The intrusion singled out an unnamed activist, who was contacted in late August 2023 and received a malicious LNK file from an address impersonating a member of the organization, non-profit entity Interlabs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. The LNK file, upon execution, launches a PowerShell command to execute a Visual Basic script that, in turn, fetches the next-stage payloads from a legitimate but compromised WordPress website. This includes the Autoit3.exe binary ("solmir.pdb") and an AutoIt script ("solmir_1.pdb") that's launched using the former. The AutoIt script, for its part, performs process injection using a&nbsp; process hollowing technique , in which malicious code is inserted into a process that's in a suspended state. In this case, an instance of Explorer.exe is spawned to inject a never-before-seen RAT referred to as SuperBear th

An open-source .NET-based information stealer malware dubbed&nbsp; SapphireStealer &nbsp;is being used by multiple entities to enhance its capabilities and spawn their own bespoke variants. "Information-stealing malware like SapphireStealer can be used to obtain sensitive information, including corporate credentials, which are often resold to other threat actors who leverage the access for additional attacks, including operations related to espionage or ransomware/extortion," Cisco Talos researcher Edmund Brumaghin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. An entire ecosystem has developed over time that allows both financially motivated and nation-state actors to use services from purveyors of stealer malware to carry out various kinds of attacks. Viewed in that light, such malware not only represents an evolution of the cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS) model, they also offer other threat actors to monetize the stolen data to distribute ransomware, conduct data theft, and other maliciou

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New findings show that malicious actors could leverage a sneaky malware detection evasion technique and bypass endpoint security solutions by manipulating the Windows Container Isolation Framework. The findings were presented by Deep Instinct security researcher Daniel Avinoam at the&nbsp; DEF CON security conference &nbsp;held earlier this month. Microsoft's&nbsp; container architecture &nbsp;(and by extension,&nbsp; Windows Sandbox ) uses what's called a&nbsp; dynamically generated image &nbsp;to separate the file system from each container to the host and at the same time avoid duplication of system files. It's nothing but an "operating system image that has clean copies of files that can change, but links to files that cannot change that are in the Windows image that already exists on the host," thereby bringing down the overall size for a full OS. "The result is images that contain 'ghost files,' which store no actual data but point to a different volume on the system,"

MMRat Android Trojan Executes Remote Financial Fraud Through Accessibility Feature<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/mmrat-android-trojan-executes-remote.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Android banking trojan dubbed&nbsp; MMRat &nbsp;has been observed targeting mobile users in Southeast Asia since late June 2023 to remotely commandeer the devices and perform financial fraud. "The malware, named after its distinctive package name com.mm.user, can capture user input and screen content, and can also remotely control victim devices through various techniques, enabling its operators to carry out bank fraud on the victim's device," Trend Micro&nbsp; said . What makes MMRat stand apart from others of its kind is the use of a customized command-and-control (C2) protocol based on protocol buffers (aka&nbsp; protobuf ) to efficiently transfer large volumes of data from compromised handsets, demonstrating the growing sophistication of Android malware. Possible targets based on the language used in the phishing pages include Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, and the Philippines. The entry point of the attacks is a network of phishing sites that mimic offici

An unknown threat actor is leveraging malicious npm packages to target developers with an aim to steal source code and configuration files from victim machines, a sign of how threats lurk consistently in open-source repositories.

Recently disclosed security flaws impacting Juniper firewalls, Openfire, and Apache RocketMQ servers have come under active exploitation in the wild, according to multiple reports. The Shadowserver Foundation&nbsp; said &nbsp;that it's "seeing exploitation attempts from multiple IPs for Juniper J-Web CVE-2023-36844 (&amp; friends) targeting /webauth_operation.php endpoint," the same day a proof-of-concept (PoC) became available. The&nbsp; issues , tracked as CVE-2023-36844, CVE-2023-36845, CVE-2023-36846, and CVE-2023-36847, reside in the J-Web component of Junos OS on Juniper SRX and EX Series. They could be chained by an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to execute arbitrary code on susceptible installations. Patches for the flaw were released on August 17, 2023, a week after which watchTowr Labs published a proof-of-concept (PoC) by combining CVE-2023-36846 and CVE-2023-36845 to execute a PHP file containing malicious shellcode.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware has released software updates to correct two security vulnerabilities in Aria Operations for Networks that could be potentially exploited to bypass authentication and gain remote code execution. The most severe of the flaws is CVE-2023-34039 (CVSS score: 9.8), which relates to a case of authentication bypass arising as a result of a lack of unique cryptographic key generation. "A malicious actor with network access to Aria Operations for Networks could bypass SSH authentication to gain access to the Aria Operations for Networks CLI," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. ProjectDiscovery researchers Harsh Jaiswal and Rahul Maini have been credited with discovering and reporting the issue. The second weakness, CVE-2023-20890 (CVSS score: 7.2), is an arbitrary file write vulnerability impacting Aria Operations for Networks that could be abused by an adversary with administrative access to write files to arbitrary locations and achieve remote code execution.

A coordinated law enforcement effort codenamed&nbsp; Operation Duck Hunt &nbsp;has felled&nbsp; QakBot , a notorious Windows malware family that's estimated to have compromised over 700,000 computers globally and facilitated financial fraud as well as ransomware. To that end, the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ)&nbsp; said &nbsp;the malware is "being deleted from victim computers, preventing it from doing any more harm," adding it seized more than $8.6 million in cryptocurrency in illicit profits. The cross-border exercise involved the participation of France, Germany, Latvia, Romania, the Netherlands, the U.K., and the U.S., alongside technical assistance from cybersecurity company Zscaler. The dismantling has been hailed as "the largest U.S.-led financial and technical disruption of a botnet infrastructure leveraged by cybercriminals." No arrests were announced.

Ask any security professional and they'll tell you that remediating risks from various siloed security scanning tools requires a tedious and labor-intensive series of steps focused on deduplication, prioritization, and routing of issues to an appropriate "fixer" somewhere in the organization. This burden on already resource-strapped security teams is an efficiency killer.&nbsp; A new study , commissioned by Seemplicity and conducted by Dark Reading, provides fresh insight into how security pros handle the challenging remediation life cycle from discovery to resolution. The research reveals the obstacles security professionals face when coordinating remediation activities. The data exposes the outcomes — in increased workload and diminished risk posture — that arise from lengthy remediation times, inefficient and uncontrolled manual processes, the lack of managerial visibility and oversight across the risk life cycle.&nbsp; Remediation Process Broken Down to Steps and Time Spent on Each Step

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning of an increase in adversary-in-the-middle ( AiTM ) phishing techniques, which are being propagated as part of the phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) cybercrime model. In addition to an uptick in AiTM-capable PhaaS platforms, the tech giant noted that existing phishing services like PerSwaysion are incorporating AiTM capabilities. "This development in the PhaaS ecosystem enables attackers to conduct high-volume phishing campaigns that attempt to circumvent MFA protections at scale," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). Phishing kits with AiTM capabilities work in two ways, one of which concerns the use of reverse proxy servers (i.e., the phishing page) to relay traffic to and from the client and legitimate website and stealthily capture user credentials, two-factor authentication codes, and session cookies. A second method involves synchronous relay servers. "In AiTM through synchronous relay s

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a case of privilege escalation associated with a Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) application by taking advantage of an abandoned reply URL. "An attacker could leverage this abandoned URL to redirect authorization codes to themselves, exchanging the ill-gotten authorization codes for access tokens," Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published last week. "The threat actor could then call Power Platform API via a middle-tier service and obtain elevated privileges." Following responsible disclosure on April 5, 2023, the issue was addressed by Microsoft via an update released a day later. Secureworks has also made available an&nbsp; open-source tool &nbsp;that other organizations can use to scan for abandoned reply URLs. Reply URL , also called redirect URI, refers to the location where the authorization server sends the user once the app has been successfully authorized and grant

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In yet another sign that developers continue to be targets of software supply chain attacks, a number of malicious packages have been discovered on the Rust programming language's crate registry. The libraries, uploaded between August 14 and 16, 2023, were published by a user named "amaperf," Phylum&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. The names of the packages, now taken down, are as follows: postgress, if-cfg, xrvrv, serd, oncecell, lazystatic, and envlogger. It's not clear what the end goal of the campaign was, but the suspicious modules were found to harbor functionalities to capture the operating system information (i.e., Windows, Linux, macOS, or Unknown) and transmit the data to a hard-coded Telegram channel via the messaging platform's API. This suggests that the campaign may have been in its early stages and that the threat actor may have been casting a wide net to compromise as many developer machines as possible to deliver rogue updates with imp

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cyber attacks on e-commerce applications are a common trend in 2023 as e-commerce businesses become more omnichannel, they build and deploy increasingly more API interfaces, with threat actors constantly exploring more ways to exploit vulnerabilities. This is why regular testing and ongoing monitoring are necessary to fully protect web applications, identifying weaknesses so they can be mitigated quickly. In this article, we will discuss the recent Honda e-commerce platform attack, how it happened, and its impact on the business and its clients. In addition, to the importance of application security testing, we will also discuss the different areas of vulnerability testing and its various phases. Finally, we will provide details on how a long-term preventative solution such as&nbsp; PTaaS &nbsp;can protect e-commerce businesses and the differences between continuous testing (PTaaS) and standard pen testing.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An updated version of a botnet malware called&nbsp; KmsdBot &nbsp;is now targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices, simultaneously branching out its capabilities and the attack surface. "The binary now includes support for&nbsp; Telnet scanning &nbsp;and support for more CPU architectures," Akamai security researcher Larry W. Cashdollar&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published this month. The latest iteration, observed since July 16, 2023, comes months after it emerged that the botnet is being offered as a&nbsp; DDoS-for-hire service &nbsp;to other threat actors. The fact that it's being actively maintained indicates its effectiveness in real-world attacks. KmsdBot was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by the web infrastructure and security company in November 2022. It's mainly designed to target private gaming servers and cloud hosting providers, although it has since set its eyes on some Romanian government and Spanish educational sites. The malware is designed to scan random IP addresses for open SSH ports and

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The leak of the&nbsp; LockBit 3.0 ransomware &nbsp;builder last year has led to threat actors abusing the tool to spawn new variants. Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky said it detected a ransomware intrusion that deployed a version of LockBit but with a markedly different ransom demand procedure. "The attacker behind this incident decided to use a different ransom note with a headline related to a previously unknown group, called NATIONAL HAZARD AGENCY," security researchers Eduardo Ovalle and Francesco Figurelli&nbsp; said . The revamped ransom note directly specified the amount to be paid to obtain the decryption keys, and directed communications to a Tox service and email, unlike the LockBit group, which doesn't mention the amount and uses its own communication and negotiation platform. NATIONAL HAZARD AGENCY is far from the only cybercrime gang to use the leaked LockBit 3.0 builder. Some of the other threat actors known to leverage it include&nbsp; Bl00dy and Buhti . Kaspersk

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Risk and financial advisory solutions provider Kroll on Friday disclosed that one of its employees fell victim to a "highly sophisticated" SIM swapping attack. The incident, which took place on August 19, 2023, targeted the employee's T-Mobile account, the company said. "Specifically, T-Mobile, without any authority from or contact with Kroll or its employee, transferred that employee's phone number to the threat actor's phone at their request," it&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. This enabled the unidentified actor to gain access to certain files containing personal information of bankruptcy claimants in the matters of BlockFi , FTX , and Genesis. SIM swapping (aka SIM splitting or simjacking), while generally a benign process, could be exploited by threat actors to fraudulently activate a SIM card under their control with a victim's phone number. This makes it possible to intercept SMS messages and voice calls and receive MFA-related messages that cont

Two U.K. teenagers have been convicted by a jury in London for being part of the notorious LAPSUS$ transnational gang and for orchestrating a series of brazen, high-profile hacks against major tech firms and demanding a ransom in exchange for not leaking the stolen information. This includes Arion Kurtaj (aka White, Breachbase, WhiteDoxbin, and TeaPotUberHacker), an 18-year-old from Oxford, and an unnamed minor, who began collaborating in July 2021 after having met online, BBC&nbsp; reported &nbsp;this week. Both the defendants were initially arrested and released under investigation in January 2022, only to be&nbsp; re-arrested and charged &nbsp;by the City of London Police in April 2022. Kurtaj was subsequently granted bail and moved to a hotel in Bicester after he was doxxed in an online cybercrime forum. He, however, continued his hacking spree, targeting companies like&nbsp; Uber ,&nbsp; Revolut , and&nbsp; Rockstar Games , as a result of which he was&nbsp; arrested again &nbsp;in September.

Every company has some level of tech debt. Unless you're a brand new start-up, you most likely have a patchwork of solutions that have been implemented throughout the years, often under various leadership teams with different priorities and goals. As those technologies age, they can leave your organization vulnerable to cyber threats. While replacing legacy technologies can be costly, those costs may pale in comparison to a breach – both in terms of immediate financial impact and reputational damage.&nbsp; Here are three ways you can communicate risk to your leadership team as you work to replace legacy infrastructure. 1: Make the Risk Real Leadership teams are driven by quantifiable business implications. The best way to get support for updating or replacing legacy technology is to make the risk to the business real - and measurable - in a language they understand. One way to do this is to look at the list of critical vulnerabilities that you've identified, then evaluate the impact t

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning that Barracuda Networks Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances patched against a recently disclosed critical flaw continue to be at risk of potential compromise from suspected Chinese hacking groups. It also&nbsp; deemed &nbsp;the fixes as "ineffective" and that it "continues to observe active intrusions and considers all affected Barracuda ESG appliances to be compromised and vulnerable to this exploit." Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-2868 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the zero-day bug is said to have been weaponized as early as October 2022, more than seven months before the security hole was plugged.

The fact that the Lazarus Group continues to rely on the same tradecraft despite those components being well-documented over the years underscores the threat actor's confidence in their operations, Talos pointed out.

A new financially motivated operation is leveraging a malicious Telegram bot to help threat actors scam their victims. Dubbed&nbsp; Telekopye , a portmanteau of Telegram and kopye (meaning "spear" in Russian), the toolkit functions as an&nbsp; automated means &nbsp;to create a phishing web page from a premade template and send the URL to potential victims, codenamed Mammoths by the criminals. "This toolkit is implemented as a Telegram bot that, when activated, provides several easy-to-navigate menus in the form of clickable buttons that can accommodate many scammers at once," ESET researcher Radek Jizba&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The exact origins of the threat actors, dubbed Neanderthals, are unclear, but evidence points to Russia as the country of origin of the toolkit's authors and users, owing to the use of Russian SMS templates and the fact that a majority of the targeted online marketplaces are popular in the country.

Public Wi-Fi, which has long since become the norm, poses threats to not only individual users but also businesses. With the rise of remote work, people can now work from virtually anywhere: a cafe close to home, a hotel in a different city, or even while waiting for a plane at the airport. Next, let's explore the risks of connecting to public Wi-Fi, both for you personally and for businesses. According to the&nbsp; Forbes Advisor &nbsp;the majority of people (56%) connect to public Wi-Fi networks that don't require a password. This convenience comes at a price, and many are unaware that attackers can steal card details, passwords, and other sensitive information. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: &nbsp;This is one of the most common threats on public Wi-Fi. In an MITM attack, the hacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties.

The SmokeLoader malware is being used to deliver a new Wi-Fi scanning malware strain called&nbsp; Whiffy Recon &nbsp;on compromised Windows machines. "The new malware strain has only one operation.

"The location returned by Google's&nbsp; Geolocation API &nbsp;is then sent back to the adversary." SmokeLoader , as the name implies, is a loader malware whose sole purpose is to drop additional payloads onto a host. Since 2014, the malware has been&nbsp; offered for sale &nbsp;to Russian-based threat actors. It's traditionally distributed via phishing emails.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recently patched security flaw in the popular WinRAR archiving software has been exploited as a zero-day since April 2023, new findings from Group-IB reveal. The vulnerability, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38831 , allows threat actors to spoof file extensions, thereby making it possible to launch malicious scripts contained within an archive that masquerades as seemingly innocuous image or text files. It was addressed in&nbsp; version 6.23 &nbsp;released on August 2, 2023, alongside CVE-2023-40477. In attacks discovered by the Singapore-based firm in July 2023, specially crafted ZIP or RAR archive files distributed via trading-related forums such as Forex Station have been used to deliver a variety of malware families such as DarkMe,&nbsp; GuLoader , and&nbsp; Remcos RAT . "After infecting devices, the cybercriminals withdraw money from broker accounts," Group-IB malware analyst Andrey Polovinkin&nbsp; said , adding as many as 130 traders' devices have been compromised as part of the campaign.

Thousands of&nbsp; Openfire XMPP servers &nbsp;are unpatched against a recently disclosed high-severity flaw and are susceptible to a new exploit, according to a&nbsp; new report &nbsp;from VulnCheck. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-32315 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5), the vulnerability relates to a path traversal vulnerability in Openfire's administrative console that could permit an unauthenticated attacker to access otherwise restricted pages reserved for privileged users. It affects all versions of the software released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0. It was remediated by its developer, Ignite Realtime, earlier this May with the release of versions 4.6.8, 4.7.5, and 4.8.0. "Path traversal protections were already in place to protect against exactly this kind of attack, but didn't defend against certain non-standard URL encoding for UTF-16 characters that were not supported by the embedded web server that was in use at the time," the maintainers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a detailed advisory.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) on Wednesday&nbsp; unsealed an indictment &nbsp;against two founders of the now-sanctioned Tornado Cash cryptocurrency mixer service, charging them with laundering more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds. Both the individuals, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Storm, 34, is said to have been arrested in the U.S. state of Washington. Semenov, 35, remains at large in Dubai. They are alleged to have "made millions of dollars in profits" from promoting and operating the service. Tornado Cash is estimated to have processed upwards of $7 billion worth of crypto assets over a period of three years. In a related move, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned &nbsp;Semenov and&nbsp; eight cryptocurrency addresses &nbsp;connected to him, days after a U.S. cou

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Tuesday warned that threat actors affiliated with North Korea may attempt to cash out stolen cryptocurrency worth more than $40 million. The law enforcement agency&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the blockchain activity to an adversary the U.S. government tracks as TraderTraitor, which is also known by the name Jade Sleet. An investigation undertaken by the FBI found that the group moved approximately 1,580 bitcoin from several cryptocurrency heists over the past 24 hours and are currently said to be holding those funds in six different wallets. North Korea is known to blur the lines among cyber warfare, espionage, and financial crime.&nbsp; TraderTraitor , in particular, has been linked to a series of attacks targeting blockchain and cryptocurrency exchanges with the goal of plundering digital assets to generate illicit revenue for the sanctions-hit nation. This includes the $60 million theft of virtual currency from Alphapo on June 22, 2023; the $37 m

Developers are not the only people who have adopted the agile methodology for their development processes. From 2023-06-15 to 2023-07-11, Permiso Security's p0 Labs team identified and tracked an attacker developing and deploying eight (8) incremental iterations of their credential harvesting malware while continuing to develop infrastructure for an upcoming (spoiler: now launched) campaign targeting various cloud services. While last week Aqua Security published a blog&nbsp;detailing this under-development campaign's stages related to infected Docker images, today&nbsp; Permiso p0 Labs &nbsp;and&nbsp; SentinelLabs &nbsp;are releasing joint research highlighting the incremental updates to the cloud credential harvesting malware samples systematically collected by monitoring the attacker's infrastructure. So get out of your seats and enjoy this scrum meeting stand-up dedicated to sharing knowledge about this actors campaign and the tooling they will use to steal more cloud credentials.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Syrian threat actor named&nbsp; EVLF &nbsp;has been outed as the creator of malware families CypherRAT and CraxsRAT. "These RATs are designed to allow an attacker to remotely perform real-time actions and control the victim device's camera, location, and microphone," Cybersecurity firm Cyfirma&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. CypherRAT and CraxsRAT are said to be offered to other cybercriminals as part of a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) scheme. As many as 100 unique threat actors are estimated to have purchased the twin tools on a lifetime license over the past three years. EVLF is said to be operating a web shop to advertise their warez since at least September 2022. CraxsRAT is billed as an Android trojan that enables a threat actor to remote control an infected device from a Windows computer, with the developer consistently releasing new updates based on feedback from the customers. The malicious package is generated using a builder, which comes with options to cus

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious toolset dubbed&nbsp; Spacecolon &nbsp;is being deployed as part of an ongoing campaign to spread variants of the Scarab ransomware across victim organizations globally. "It probably finds its way into victim organizations by its operators compromising vulnerable web servers or via brute forcing RDP credentials," ESET security researcher Jakub Souček&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a detailed technical write-up published Tuesday. The Slovak cybersecurity firm, which dubbed the threat actor CosmicBeetle, said the origins of the Spacecolon date back to May 2020. The highest concentration of victims has been detected in France, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and Turkey. While the exact provenance of the adversary is unclear, several Spacecolon variants are said to contain Turkish strings, likely pointing to the involvement of a Turkish-speaking developer. There is no evidence currently linking it to any other known threat actor group. Some of the targets include a hospital and a tourist reso

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More than a dozen malicious packages have been discovered on the npm package repository since the start of August 2023 with capabilities to deploy an open-source information stealer called&nbsp; Luna Token Grabber &nbsp;on systems belonging to Roblox developers. The ongoing campaign, first detected on August 1 by ReversingLabs, employs modules that masquerade as the legitimate package&nbsp; noblox.js , an API wrapper that's used to create scripts that interact with the Roblox gaming platform. The software supply chain security company described the activity as a "replay of an attack&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;two years ago" in October 2021. "The malicious packages [...] reproduce code from the legitimate noblox.js package but add malicious, information-stealing functions," software threat researcher Lucija Valentić&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. The packages were cumulatively downloaded 963 times before they were taken down. The names of the rogue packages are as follows - noblox.js-v

A previously undocumented threat cluster has been linked to a software supply chain attack targeting organizations primarily located in Hong Kong and other regions in Asia. The Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, is tracking the activity under its insect-themed moniker Carderbee. The attacks, per the cybersecurity firm, leverage a trojanized version of a legitimate software called EsafeNet Cobra DocGuard Client to deliver a known backdoor called&nbsp; PlugX &nbsp;(aka Korplug) on victim networks. "In the course of this attack, the attackers used malware signed with a legitimate Microsoft certificate," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The use of Cobra DocGuard Client to pull off a supply chain attack was previously highlighted by ESET in its&nbsp; quarterly Threat Report &nbsp;this year, detailing a September 2022 intrusion in which an unnamed gambling company in Hong Kong was compromised via a malicious update pushed by the software.

"If exploited, this vulnerability enables an unauthenticated actor to access some sensitive APIs that are used to configure the Ivanti Sentry on the administrator portal (port 8443, commonly MICS)," the company&nbsp; said . "While the issue has a high CVSS score, there is a low risk of exploitation for customers who do not expose port 8443 to the internet." Successful exploitation of the bug could allow an attacker to change configuration, run system commands, or write files onto the system. It's recommen

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; added &nbsp;a critical security flaw in Adobe ColdFusion to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. The vulnerability, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-26359 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), relates to a deserialization flaw present in Adobe ColdFusion 2018 (Update 15 and earlier) and ColdFusion 2021 (Update 5 and earlier) that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user without requiring any interaction. Deserialization &nbsp;(aka unmarshaling) refers to the process of reconstructing a data structure or an object from a byte stream. But when it's performed without validating its source or sanitizing its contents, it can lead to&nbsp; unexpected consequences &nbsp;such as code execution or denial-of-service (DoS). It was&nbsp; patched &nbsp;by Adobe as part of updates issued in March 2023. As of writing, it's immediately not clear how the flaw is being&nbsp; abused in the wil

A high-severity security flaw has been disclosed in the WinRAR utility that could be potentially exploited by a threat actor to achieve remote code execution on Windows systems. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-40477 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), the vulnerability has been described as a case of improper validation while processing recovery volumes. "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer," the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process." Successful exploitation of the flaw requires user interaction in that the target must be lured into visiting a malicious page or by simply opening a booby-trapped archive file. A security researcher, who goes by the alias goodbyeselene, has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on June 8, 2023. The issue has been address

From a user's perspective, OAuth works like magic. In just a few keystrokes, you can whisk through the account creation process and gain immediate access to whatever new app or integration you're seeking. Unfortunately, few users understand the implications of the permissions they allow when they create a new OAuth grant, making it easy for malicious actors to manipulate employees into giving away unintended access to corporate environments. In one of the&nbsp; highest-profile examples , Pawn Storm's attacks against the Democratic National Convention and others leveraged OAuth to target victims through social engineering.&nbsp; Security and IT teams would be wise to establish a practice of reviewing new and existing OAuth grants programmatically to catch risky activity or overly-permissive scopes. And, there are new solutions for&nbsp; SaaS security &nbsp;cropping up that can make this process easier. Let's take a look at some best practices for prioritizing and investigating your organization's grants

"Although the proxy website claims that its exit nodes come only from users who have been informed and agreed to the use of their device," the cybersecurity company&nbsp; said &nbsp;it found evidence where "malware writers are installing the proxy silently in infected systems." Multiple malware families have been observed delivering the proxy to users searching for cracked software and games.

The threat actors behind the HiatusRAT malware have returned from their hiatus with a new wave of reconnaissance and targeting activity aimed at Taiwan-based organizations and a U.S. military procurement system. Besides recompiling malware samples for different architectures, the artifacts are said to have been hosted on new virtual private servers (VPSs), Lumen Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. The cybersecurity firm described the activity cluster as "brazen" and "one of the most audacious," indicating no signs of slowing down. The identity and the origin of the threat actors are presently unknown. Targets included commercial firms, such as semiconductor and chemical manufacturers, and at least one municipal government organization in Taiwan as well as a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) server associated with submitting and retrieving proposals for defense contracts.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed an updated version of an advanced fingerprinting and redirection toolkit called&nbsp; WoofLocker &nbsp;that's engineered to conduct tech support scams. The sophisticated traffic redirection scheme was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Malwarebytes in January 2020, leveraging JavaScript embedded in compromised websites to perform anti-bot and web traffic filtering checks to serve next-stage JavaScript that redirects users to a browser locker (aka browlock). This redirection mechanism, in turn, makes use of steganographic tricks to conceal the JavaScript code within a PNG image that's served only when the validation phase is successful. Should a user be detected as a bot or not interesting traffic, a decoy PNG file without the malicious code is used. WoofLocker is also known as 404Browlock due to the fact that visiting the browlock URL directly without the appropriate redirection or one-time session token results in a 404 error page.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Networking hardware company Juniper Networks has released an "out-of-cycle" security update to address multiple flaws in the J-Web component of Junos OS that could be combined to achieve remote code execution on susceptible installations. The four vulnerabilities have a cumulative CVSS rating of 9.8, making them Critical in severity. They affect all versions of Junos OS on SRX and EX Series. "By chaining exploitation of these vulnerabilities, an unauthenticated, network-based attacker may be able to remotely execute code on the devices," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory released on August 17, 2023. The J-Web interface allows users to configure, manage, and monitor Junos OS devices. A brief description of the flaws is as follows - CVE-2023-36844 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-36845 &nbsp;(CVSS scores: 5.3) - Two PHP external variable modification vulnerabilities in J-Web of Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX Series and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are using Android Package (APK) files with unknown or unsupported compression methods to elude malware analysis. That's according to findings from Zimperium, which found 3,300 artifacts leveraging such compression algorithms in the wild. 71 of the identified samples can be loaded on the operating system without any problems. There is no evidence that the apps were available on the Google Play Store at any point in time, indicating that the apps were distributed through other means, typically via untrusted app stores or social engineering to trick the victims into sideloading them. The APK files use "a technique that limits the possibility of decompiling the application for a large number of tools, reducing the possibilities of being analyzed," security researcher Fernando Ortega&nbsp; said . "In order to do that, the APK (which is in essence a ZIP file), is using an unsupported decompression method." The advantage of such an approach is its abilit

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coordinated law enforcement operation across 25 African countries has led to the arrest of 14 suspected cybercriminals, INTERPOL&nbsp; announced &nbsp;Friday. The exercise, conducted in partnership with AFRIPOL, enabled investigators to identify 20,674 cyber networks that were linked to financial losses of more than $40 million. "The four-month Africa Cyber Surge II operation was launched in April 2023 and focused on identifying cybercriminals and compromised infrastructure," the agency said. As part of the operation, three suspects were arrested in Cameroon in connection with an online scam involving the fraudulent sale of works of art worth $850,000. Another suspect was arrested in Nigeria for defrauding a Gambian victim. Also arrested were two money mules linked to scams initiated through messaging platforms. The cyber networks comprised 3,786 command-and-control (C2) servers, 14,134 victim IP addresses tied to data stealer infections, 1,415 phishing links and domains, 939

They used fake digital authentication tokens to access webmail accounts running on Microsoft's Outlook service. In this incident, the attackers stole a signing key from Microsoft, enabling them to issue functional access tokens for Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Outlook.com and to download emails and attachments. Due to a plausibility check error, the digital signature, which was only intended for private customer accounts (MSA), also worked in the Azure Active Directory for business customers.&nbsp; Embracing the Zero Trust Revolution Acc

Microsoft on Thursday disclosed that it found a new version of the&nbsp; BlackCat &nbsp;ransomware (aka ALPHV and Noberus) that embeds tools like Impacket and RemCom to facilitate lateral movement and remote code execution.

RemCom, billed as an open-source alternative to PsExec, has been put to use by Chinese and Iranian nation-state threat actors like&nbsp; Dalbit &nbsp;and&nbsp; Chafer &nbsp;(aka Remix Kitten) to move across the victim environments in the past.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has announced plans to add a new feature in the upcoming version of its Chrome web browser to alert users when an extension they have installed has been removed from the Chrome Web Store. The feature, set for release alongside Chrome 117, allows users to be notified when an add-on has been unpublished by a developer, taken down for violating Chrome Web Store policy, or marked as malware. The tech giant said it intends to highlight such extensions under a "Safety check" category in the "Privacy and security" section of the browser settings page. "When a user clicks 'Review,' they will be taken to their extensions and given the choice to either remove the extension or hide the warning if they wish to keep the extension installed," Oliver Dunk, a developer relations engineer for Chrome extensions,&nbsp; said . "As in previous versions of Chrome, extensions marked as malware are automatically disabled." The development comes as the c

NoFilter Attack: Sneaky Privilege Escalation Method Bypasses Windows Security<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/nofilter-attack-sneaky-privilege.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undetected attack method called&nbsp; NoFilter &nbsp;has been found to abuse the Windows Filtering Platform ( WFP ) to achieve privilege escalation in the Windows operating system. "If an attacker has the ability to execute code with admin privilege and the target is to perform&nbsp; LSASS Shtinkering , these privileges are not enough," Ron Ben Yizhak, a security researcher at Deep Instinct, told The Hacker News. "Running as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" is required. The techniques described in this research can escalate from admin to SYSTEM." The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;were presented at the DEF CON security conference over the weekend. The starting point of the&nbsp; research &nbsp;is an in-house tool called RPC Mapper the cybersecurity company used to map remote procedure call ( RPC ) methods, specifically those that invoke&nbsp; WinAPI , leading to the discovery of a method named "BfeRpcOpenToken," which is part of WFP.

An ongoing cyber attack campaign originating from China is targeting the Southeast Asian gambling sector to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons on compromised systems.&nbsp; Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne said the tactics, techniques, and procedures point to the involvement of a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; Bronze Starlight &nbsp;(aka Emperor Dragonfly or Storm-0401), which has been linked to the use of&nbsp; short-lived &nbsp; ransomware families &nbsp;as a smokescreen to conceal its espionage motives. "The threat actors abuse Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Edge, and McAfee VirusScan executables vulnerable to DLL hijacking to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons," security researchers Aleksandar Milenkoski and Tom Hegel&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published today. It also bears noting that the campaign exhibits overlaps with an intrusion set monitored by ESET under the name&nbsp; Operation ChattyGoblin .

New Apple iOS 16 Exploit Enables Stealthy Cellular Access Under Fake Airplane Mode<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-apple-ios-16-exploit-enables.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have documented a novel post-exploit persistence technique on iOS 16 that could be abused to fly under the radar and maintain access to an Apple device even when the victim believes it is offline. The method "tricks the victim into thinking their device's Airplane Mode works when in reality the attacker (following successful device exploit) has planted an artificial Airplane Mode which edits the UI to display Airplane Mode icon and cuts internet connection to all apps except the attacker application," Jamf Threat Labs researchers Hu Ke and Nir Avraham said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Airplane Mode , as the name implies, allows users to turn off wireless features in their devices, effectively preventing them from connecting to Wi-Fi networks, cellular data, and Bluetooth as well as sending or receiving calls and text messages. The approach devised by Jamf, in a nutshell, provides an illusion to the user that the Airplane Mode is

New LABRAT Campaign Exploits GitLab Flaw for Cryptojacking and Proxyjacking Activities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-labrat-campaign-exploits-gitlab.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new, financially motivated operation dubbed&nbsp; LABRAT &nbsp;has been observed weaponizing a now-patched critical flaw in GitLab as part of a cryptojacking and proxyjacking campaign. "The attacker utilized undetected signature-based tools, sophisticated and stealthy cross-platform malware, command-and-control (C2) tools which bypassed firewalls, and kernel-based rootkits to hide their presence," Sysdig&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Furthermore, the attacker abused a legitimate service,&nbsp; TryCloudflare , to obfuscate their C2 network." Proxyjacking &nbsp;allows the attacker to rent the compromised host out to a proxy network, making it possible to monetize the unused bandwidth. Cryptojacking, on the other hand, refers to the abuse of the system resources to mine cryptocurrency. A notable aspect of the campaign is the use of compiled binaries written in Go and .NET to fly under the radar, with LABRAT also providing backdoor access to the infected systems.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hitherto undocumented threat actor operating for nearly a decade and codenamed&nbsp; MoustachedBouncer has been attributed to cyber espionage attacks aimed at foreign embassies in Belarus. "Since 2020, MoustachedBouncer has most likely been able to perform adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks at the ISP level, within Belarus, in order to compromise its targets," ESET security researcher Matthieu Faou&nbsp; said , describing the group as skilled and advanced. The adversary, active since at least 2014, is assessed to be aligned with Belarusian interests, likely employing a lawful interception system such as&nbsp; SORM &nbsp;to conduct its AitM attacks as well as deploy disparate tools called NightClub and Disco. Both the Windows malware frameworks support additional spying plugins including a screenshotter, an audio recorder, and a file stealer. The oldest sample of NightClub dates back to November 19, 2014, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal from Ukraine. Embassy staff from four differ

Google has announced plans to add support for quantum-resistant encryption algorithms in its Chrome browser, starting with version 116.

The encryption algorithm has already been adopted by&nbsp; Cloudflare ,&nbsp; Amazon Web Services , and IBM. X25519Kyber768 is a hybrid algorithm that combines the output of&nbsp; X25519 , an elliptic curve algorithm widely used for key agreement in TLS, and Kyber-768 to create a strong session key to encrypt TLS connections.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Chinese threat actor known as APT31 (aka Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, or Violet Typhoon) has been linked to a set of advanced backdoors that are capable of exfiltrating harvested sensitive information to Dropbox. The malware is part of a broader collection of&nbsp; more than 15 implants &nbsp;that have been put to use by the adversary in attacks targeting industrial organizations in Eastern Europe in 2022. "The attackers aimed to establish a permanent channel for data exfiltration, including data stored on air-gapped systems," Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis spotlighting APT31's previously undocumented tradecraft. The intrusions employ a three-stage malware stack, each focused on disparate aspects of the attack chain: setting up persistence, gathering sensitive data, and transmitting the information to a remote server under the threat actor's control. Some variants of the second-stage backdoors also come with features designed to look up file names in the Microso

New SystemBC Malware Variant Targets Southern African Power Company<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-systembc-malware-variant-targets.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been linked to a cyber attack on a power generation company in southern Africa with a new variant of the SystemBC malware called DroxiDat as a precursor to a suspected ransomware attack. "The proxy-capable backdoor was deployed alongside Cobalt Strike Beacons in a south African nation's critical infrastructure," Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT),&nbsp; said . The Russian cybersecurity company said the attack, which took place in late March 2023, was in its early stages and involved the use of DroxiDat to profile the system and proxy network traffic using the&nbsp; SOCKS5 protocol &nbsp;to and from command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. SystemBC &nbsp;is a C/C++-based commodity malware and remote administrative tool that was&nbsp; first seen in 2019 . Its main feature is to set up&nbsp; SOCKS5 proxies &nbsp;on victim computers that can then be used by threat actors to tunnel malicious traffic associ

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A set of 16 high-severity security flaws have been disclosed in the&nbsp; CODESYS V3 &nbsp;software development kit (SDK) that could result in remote code execution and denial-of-service under specific conditions, posing risks to operational technology (OT) environments. The flaws, tracked from CVE-2022-47378 through CVE-2022-47393 and dubbed&nbsp; CoDe16 , carry a CVSS score of 8.8 with the exception of CVE-2022-47391, which has a severity rating of 7.5. Twelve of the flaws are buffer overflow vulnerabilities. "Exploitation of the discovered vulnerabilities, which affect all versions of CODESYS V3 prior to version 3.5.19.0, could put operational technology (OT) infrastructure at risk of attacks, such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial-of-service (DoS)," Vladimir Tokarev of the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Community&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; added &nbsp;a recently patched security flaw in Microsoft's .NET and Visual Studio products to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38180 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5), the high-severity flaw relates to a case denial-of-service (DoS) impacting .NET and Visual Studio. It was&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;by Microsoft as part of its August 2023 Patch Tuesday updates shipped earlier this week, tagging it with an "Exploitation More Likely" assessment. While exact details surrounding the nature of exploitation are unclear, the Windows maker has acknowledged the existence of a proof-of-concept (PoC) in its advisory. It also said that attacks leveraging the flaw can be pulled off without any additional privileges or user interaction. "Proof-of-concept exploit code is available, or an attack demonstration is not practical for most systems," the company

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors are using a legitimate Rust-based injector called&nbsp; Freeze[.]rs &nbsp;to deploy a commodity malware called XWorm in victim environments. The novel attack chain, detected by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs on July 13, 2023, is initiated via a phishing email containing a booby-trapped PDF file. It has also been used to introduce Remcos RAT by means of a crypter called SYK Crypter, which was first documented by Morphisec in May 2022. "This file redirects to an HTML file and utilizes the 'search-ms' protocol to access an LNK file on a remote server," security researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . "Upon clicking the LNK file, a PowerShell script executes Freeze[.]rs and SYK Crypter for further offensive actions." Freeze[.]rs, released on May 4, 2023, is a&nbsp; open-source red teaming tool &nbsp;from Optiv that functions as a payload creation tool used for circumventing security solutions and executing shellcode in a stealthy manner.

A new information malware strain called&nbsp; Statc Stealer &nbsp;has been found infecting devices running Microsoft Windows to siphon sensitive personal and payment information. "Statc Stealer exhibits a broad range of stealing capabilities, making it a significant threat," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Shivam Sharma and Amandeep Kumar&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published this week. "It can steal sensitive information from various web browsers, including login data, cookies, web data, and preferences. Additionally, it targets cryptocurrency wallets, credentials, passwords, and even data from messaging apps like Telegram." Written in C++, the malicious stealer finds its way into victim systems when potential victims are tricked into clicking on seemingly innocuous ads, with the stealer imitating an MP4 video file format on web browsers like Google Chrome.

Attackers continue to target Microsoft identities to gain access to connected Microsoft applications and federated SaaS applications. Additionally, attackers continue to progress their attacks in these environments, not by exploiting vulnerabilities, but by abusing native Microsoft functionality to achieve their objective. The attacker group Nobelium, linked with the SolarWinds attacks, has been documented using native functionality like the creation of Federated Trusts&nbsp; [1] &nbsp;to enable persistent access to a Microsoft tenant. This article demonstrates an additional native functionality that when leveraged by an attacker enables persistent access to a Microsoft cloud tenant and lateral movement capabilities to another tenant. This attack vector enables an attacker operating in a compromised tenant to abuse a misconfigured Cross-Tenant Synchronization (CTS) configuration and gain access to other connected tenants or deploy a rogue CTS configuration to maintain persistence within the te

The findings from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which carried out an analysis of the encryption mechanism used in Tencent's Sogou Input Method , an app that has over 455 million monthly active users across Windows, Android, and iOS. The vulnerabilities are rooted in EncryptWall, the service's custom encryption system, allowing network eavesdroppers to extract the textual content and access sensitive data. "The Windows and Android versions of Sogou Input Method contain vulnerabilities in this encryption system, including a vulnerability to a CBC&nbsp; padding oracle attack , which allow network eavesdroppers to recover the plaintext of encrypted network transmissions, revealing sensitive information including what users have typed," the researchers&nbsp; said .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are increasingly using a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit dubbed EvilProxy to pull off account takeover attacks aimed at high-ranking executives at prominent companies. According to Proofpoint, an ongoing hybrid campaign has leveraged the service to target thousands of Microsoft 365 user accounts, sending approximately 120,000 phishing emails to hundreds of organizations worldwide between March and June 2023. Nearly 39% of the hundreds of compromised users are said to be C-level executives, including CEOs (9%) and CFOs (17%). The attacks have also singled out personnel with access to financial assets or sensitive information. At least 35% of all compromised users had additional account protections enabled. The campaigns are seen as a response to the increased adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in enterprises, prompting threat actors to evolve their tactics to bypass new security layers by incorporating adversary-in-the-middle ( AitM ) phishing kits to

Interpol has announced the takedown of a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform called 16Shop, in addition to the arrests of three individuals in Indonesia and Japan. 16Shop specialized in the sales of phishing kits that other cybercriminals can purchase to mount phishing attacks on a large scale, ultimately facilitating the theft of credentials and payment details from users of popular services such as Apple, PayPal, American Express, Amazon, and Cash App, among others. "Victims typically receive an email with a pdf file or link that redirects to a site requesting the victims' credit card or other personally identifiable information," Interpol&nbsp; said . "This information is then stolen and used to extract money from the victims." No less than 70,000 users across 43 countries are estimated to have been compromised via services offered on 16Shop.

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a trio of side-channel attacks that could be exploited to leak sensitive data from modern CPUs. Called&nbsp; Collide+Power &nbsp;( CVE-2023-20583 ),&nbsp; Downfall &nbsp;( CVE-2022-40982 ), and&nbsp; Inception &nbsp;( CVE-2023-20569 ), the novel methods follow the disclosure of another newly discovered security vulnerability affecting AMD's Zen 2 architecture-based processors known as&nbsp; Zenbleed &nbsp;(CVE-2023-20593). "Downfall attacks target a critical weakness found in billions of modern processors used in personal and cloud computers,"&nbsp; Daniel Moghimi , senior research scientist at Google,&nbsp; said . "This vulnerability [...] enables a user to access and steal data from other users who share the same computer." In a hypothetical attack scenario, a malicious app installed on a device could weaponize the method to steal sensitive information like passwords and encryption keys, effectively undermining Intel's Software Guard eXtensions ( SGX

Hackers associated with China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) have been linked to attacks in 17 different countries in Asia, Europe, and North America from 2021 to 2023. Cybersecurity firm Recorded Future attributed the intrusion set to a nation-state group it tracks under the name&nbsp; RedHotel &nbsp;(previously Threat Activity Group-22 or TAG-22), which overlaps with a cluster of activity broadly monitored as&nbsp; Aquatic Panda ,&nbsp; Bronze University , Charcoal Typhoon,&nbsp; Earth Lusca , and&nbsp; Red Scylla &nbsp;(or Red Dev 10). Active since 2019, some of the prominent sectors targeted by the prolific actor encompass academia, aerospace, government, media, telecommunications, and research.

Validate security continuously across your full stack with Pen Testing as a Service. In today's modern security operations center (SOC), it's a battle between the defenders and the cybercriminals. Both are using tools and expertise – however, the cybercriminals have the element of surprise on their side, and a host of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that have evolved. These external threat actors have now been further emboldened in the era of AI with open-source tools like ChatGPT. With the potential of an attack leading to a breach within minutes, CISOs now are looking to prepare all systems and assets for cyber resilience and rapid response when needed. With tools and capabilities to validate security continuously – including penetration testing as a service – DevSecOps teams can remediate critical vulnerabilities fast due to the easy access to tactical support to the teams that need it the most.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has introduced a new security feature in Android 14 that allows IT administrators to disable support for 2G cellular networks in their managed device fleet. The search giant said it's introducing a second user setting to turn off support, at the model level, for&nbsp; null-ciphered cellular connections . "The Android Security Model assumes that all networks are hostile to keep users safe from network packet injection, tampering, or eavesdropping on user traffic," Roger Piqueras Jover, Yomna Nasser, and Sudhi Herle&nbsp; said . "Android does not rely on link-layer encryption to address this threat model. Instead, Android establishes that all network traffic should be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)." 2G networks, in particular, employ weak encryption and lack mutual authentication,&nbsp; rendering &nbsp;them&nbsp; susceptible &nbsp;to over-the-air interception and traffic decryption attacks by impersonating a real 2G tower.

The U.K. Electoral Commission on Tuesday disclosed a "complex" cyber attack on its systems that went undetected for over a year, allowing the threat actors to access years worth of voter data belonging to 40 million people. "The incident was identified in October 2022 after suspicious activity was detected on our systems," the regulator&nbsp; said . "It became clear that hostile actors had first accessed the systems in August 2021." The intrusion enabled unauthorized access to the Commission's servers hosting email, control systems, and copies of the electoral registers it maintains for research purposes. The identity of the intruders are presently unknown. The registers included the name and address of anyone in the U.K. who registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, as well as the names of those registered as overseas voters. However, they did not contain information of those who qualified to register anonymously and addresses of overseas electors regi

Exposed Kubernetes (K8s) clusters are being exploited by malicious actors to deploy cryptocurrency miners and other backdoors.

In total, Kubernetes clusters belonging to more than 350 organizations, open-source projects, and individuals were discovered, 60% of which were the target of an active crypto-mining campaign. The publicly-accessible clusters, per Aqua, are said to suffer from two different kinds of misconfigurations: allowing anonymous access with high privileges and running kubectl proxy with the flags "--address=`0.0.0.0` --accept-hosts `.*`" "Housing a wide array of sensitive and valuable assets, Kubernetes clusters can store customer data, financial records, intellectual property, a

QakBot Malware Operators Expand C2 Network with 15 New Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/qakbot-malware-operators-expand-c2.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators associated with the QakBot (aka QBot) malware have set up 15 new command-and-control (C2) servers as of late June 2023. The findings are a continuation of the malware's infrastructure analysis from Team Cymru, and arrive a little over two months after Lumen Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that 25% of its C2 servers are only active for a single day. "QakBot has a history of taking an extended break each summer before returning sometime in September, with this year's spamming activities ceasing around 22 June 2023," the cybersecurity firm&nbsp; said . "But are the QakBot operators actually on vacation when they aren't spamming, or is this 'break' a time for them to refine and update their infrastructure and tools?" QakBot's C2 network, like in the case of Emotet and IcedID, is&nbsp; characterized &nbsp;by a tiered architecture in which C2 nodes communicate with upstream Tier 2 (T2) C2 nodes hosted on VPS providers geolocated in Russia.

Hackers Abusing Cloudflare Tunnels for Covert Communications<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/hackers-abusing-cloudflare-tunnels-for.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has revealed that threat actors are abusing Cloudflare Tunnels to establish covert communication channels from compromised hosts and retain persistent access. "Cloudflared is functionally very similar to ngrok," Nic Finn, a senior threat intelligence analyst at GuidePoint Security, said . "However, Cloudflared differs from ngrok in that it provides a lot more usability for free, including the ability to host TCP connectivity over cloudflared." A command-line tool for Cloudflare Tunnel, cloudflared allows users to create secure connections between an origin web server and Cloudflare's nearest data center so as to hide the web server IP addresses as well as block volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and brute-force login attacks. For a threat actor with elevated access on an infected host, this feature presents a lucrative approach to set up a foothold by generating a token required to establish the tunnel from the victim machine.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Introduced in 1999, Microsoft Active Directory is the default identity and access management service in Windows networks, responsible for assigning and enforcing security policies for all network endpoints. With it, users can access various resources across networks. As things tend to do, times, they are a'changin' – and a few years back, Microsoft introduced Azure Active Directory, the cloud-based version of AD to extend the AD paradigm, providing organizations with an Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solution across both the cloud and on-prem apps. (Note that as of July 11th 2023, this service was renamed to&nbsp; Microsoft Entra ID , but for the sake of simplicity, we'll refer to it as Azure AD in this post) Both Active Directory and Azure AD are critical to the functioning of on-prem, cloud-based, and hybrid ecosystems, playing a key role in uptime and business continuity. And with 90% of organizations using the service for employee authentication, access control and ID manag

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor is using a variant of the Yashma ransomware to target various entities in English-speaking countries, Bulgaria, China, and Vietnam at least since June 4, 2023. Cisco Talos, in a new write-up, attributed the operation with moderate confidence to an adversary of likely Vietnamese origin. "The threat actor uses an uncommon technique to deliver the ransom note," security researcher Chetan Raghuprasad&nbsp; said . "Instead of embedding the ransom note strings in the binary, they download the ransom note from the actor-controlled GitHub repository by executing an embedded batch file." Yashma,&nbsp; first described &nbsp;by the BlackBerry research and intelligence team in May 2022, is a rebranded version of another ransomware strain called Chaos. A month prior to its emergence, the Chaos ransomware builder was leaked in the wild. A notable aspect of the ransom note is its resemblance to the well-known WannaCry ransomware, possibly done so in an attempt to obs

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a set of 11 living-off-the-land binaries-and-scripts ( LOLBAS ) that could be maliciously abused by threat actors to conduct post-exploitation activities.&nbsp; "LOLBAS is an attack method that uses binaries and scripts that are already part of the system for malicious purposes," Pentera security researcher Nir Chako&nbsp; said . "This makes it hard for security teams to distinguish between legitimate and malicious activities, since they are all performed by trusted system utilities." To that end, the Israeli cybersecurity company said it uncovered nine LOLBAS downloaders and three executors that could enable adversaries to download and execute "more robust malware" on infected hosts. This includes: MsoHtmEd.exe, Mspub.exe, ProtocolHandler.exe, ConfigSecurityPolicy.exe, InstallUtil.exe, Mshta.exe, Presentationhost.exe, Outlook.exe, MSAccess.exe, scp.exe, and sftp.exe.&nbsp; "In a complete attack chain, a hacker will us

In today's interconnected world, evolving security solutions to meet growing demand is more critical than ever. Collaboration across multiple solutions for intelligence gathering and information sharing is indispensable. The idea of multiple-source intelligence gathering stems from the concept that threats are rarely isolated. Hence, their detection and prevention require a comprehensive understanding of the broader landscape. A comprehensive and robust security framework should be established by aggregating resources, knowledge, and expertise from various sources. This collaborative effort allows for the analysis of diverse data sets, the identification of emerging patterns, and the timely dissemination of crucial information.&nbsp; In this article, we discuss a versatile security platform that can operate in two distinct roles within a security ecosystem. This platform can function as a subscriber, actively collecting and aggregating security data from various endpoints and other so

A group of academics has devised a "deep learning-based acoustic side-channel attack" that can be used to classify laptop keystrokes that are recorded using a nearby phone with 95% accuracy. "When trained on keystrokes recorded using the video conferencing software Zoom, an accuracy of 93% was achieved, a new best for the medium," researchers Joshua Harrison, Ehsan Toreini, and Maryam Mehrnezhad&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new study published last week. Side-channel attacks&nbsp; refer &nbsp;to a class of&nbsp; security exploits &nbsp;that aim to glean insights from a system by monitoring and measuring its physical effects during the processing of sensitive data. Some of the common observable effects include runtime behavior, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, acoustics, and cache accesses. Although a completely side-channel-free implementation does not exist, practical attacks of this kind can have damaging consequences for user privacy and security as they could be weaponized by a ma

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Vulnerable&nbsp; Redis services &nbsp;have been targeted by a "new, improved, dangerous" variant of a malware called SkidMap that's engineered to target a wide range of Linux distributions. "The malicious nature of this malware is to adapt to the system on which it is executed," Trustwave security researcher Radoslaw Zdonczyk&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. Some of the Linux distribution SkidMap sets its eyes on include Alibaba, Anolis, openEuler, EulerOS, Stream, CentOS, RedHat, and Rocky. SkidMap was&nbsp; first disclosed &nbsp;by Trend Micro in September 2019 as a cryptocurrency mining botnet with capabilities to load malicious kernel modules that can obfuscate its activities as well as monitor the miner process. The operators of the malware have also been found camouflaging their backup command-and-control (C2) IP address on the Bitcoin blockchain, evocative of another botnet malware known as&nbsp; Glupteba .

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning about cyber crooks masquerading as legitimate non-fungible token (NFT) developers to steal cryptocurrency and other digital assets from unsuspecting users. In these fraudulent schemes, criminals either obtain direct access to NFT developer social media accounts or create look-alike accounts to promote "exclusive" new NFT releases, often employing misleading advertising campaigns that create a sense of urgency to pull them off. "Links provided in these announcements are phishing links directing victims to a spoofed website that appears to be a legitimate extension of a particular NFT project," the FBI&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory last week. The replica websites urge potential targets to connect their cryptocurrency wallets and purchase the NFT, only for the threat actors to siphon the funds and NFTs to wallets under their control.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are using an open-source rootkit called&nbsp; Reptile &nbsp;to target Linux systems in South Korea. "Unlike other rootkit malware that typically only provide concealment capabilities, Reptile goes a step further by offering a reverse shell, allowing threat actors to easily take control of systems," the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. "Port knocking is a method where the malware opens a specific port on an infected system and goes on standby. When the threat actor sends a magic packet to the system, the received packet is used as a basis to establish a connection with the C&amp;C server." A rootkit is a malicious software program that's designed to provide privileged, root-level access to a machine while concealing its presence. At least four different campaigns have leveraged Reptile since 2022. The first use of the rootkit was&nbsp; recorded &nbsp;by Trend Micro in May 2022 in connection with an intrusion

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new high-severity security flaw in PaperCut print management software for Windows that could result in remote code execution under specific circumstances. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-39143 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.4), the flaw impacts PaperCut NG/MF prior to version 22.1.3. It has been described as a combination of a path traversal and file upload vulnerability. "CVE-2023-39143 enables unauthenticated attackers to potentially read, delete, and upload arbitrary files to the PaperCut MF/NG application server, resulting in remote code execution in certain configurations," Horizon3.ai's Naveen Sunkavally&nbsp; said . The cybersecurity firm said that file upload leading to remote code execution is possible when the external device integration setting is enabled, which is on by default in some installations of PaperCut. Earlier this April, another remote code execution vulnerability in the same product (CVE-2023-27350, CVSS score: 9.8) and an infor

NYC Couple Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering in $3.6 Billion Bitfinex Hack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/nyc-couple-pleads-guilty-to-money.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A married couple from New York City has pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in connection with the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency stock exchange Bitfinex, resulting in the theft of about 120,000 bitcoin. The development comes more than a year after Ilya Lichtenstein, 35, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 33, were&nbsp; arrested in February 2022 , following the seizure of roughly 95,000 of the stolen crypto assets that were held by the defendants. The funds were valued at $3.6 billion at the time. Since then, the U.S. government said it has since seized another approximately $475 million tied to the breach. "Lichtenstein used a number of advanced hacking tools and techniques to gain access to Bitfinex's network," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)&nbsp; said . "Once inside their systems, Lichtenstein fraudulently authorized more than 2,000 transactions in which 119,754 bitcoin was transferred from Bitfinex to a cryptocurrency wallet in Lichtenstein's control."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new bunch of malicious packages on the npm package registry that are designed to exfiltrate sensitive developer information. Software supply chain firm Phylum, which first identified the "test" packages on July 31, 2023, said they "demonstrated increasing functionality and refinement," hours after which they were removed and re-uploaded under different, legitimate-sounding package names. While the end goal of the undertaking is not clear, it's suspected to be a highly targeted campaign&nbsp; aimed at the cryptocurrency sector &nbsp;based on references to modules such as "rocketrefer" and "binarium." All the packages were published by the npm user malikrukd4732. A common feature across all the modules is the ability to launch JavaScript ("index.js") that's equipped to exfiltrate valuable information to a remote server.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A four-year-old critical security flaw impacting Fortinet FortiOS SSL has emerged as one of the most routinely and frequently exploited vulnerabilities in 2022. "In 2022, malicious cyber actors exploited older software vulnerabilities more frequently than recently disclosed vulnerabilities and targeted unpatched, internet-facing systems," cybersecurity and intelligence agencies from the Five Eyes nations, which comprises Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S.,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a joint alert. The continued weaponization of&nbsp; CVE-2018-13379 , which was also one among the most exploited bugs in&nbsp; 2020 &nbsp;and&nbsp; 2021 , suggests a failure on the part of organizations to apply patches in a timely manner, the authorities said.

Threat actors are leveraging a technique called versioning to evade Google Play Store's malware detections and target Android users. "Campaigns using versioning commonly target users' credentials, data, and finances," Google Cybersecurity Action Team (GCAT)&nbsp; s aid &nbsp;in its August 2023 Threat Horizons Report shared with The Hacker News. While versioning is not a new phenomenon, it's sneaky and hard to detect. In this method, a developer releases an initial version of an app on the Play Store that passes Google's pre-publication checks, but is later updated with a malware component. This is achieved by pushing an update from an attacker-controlled server to serve malicious code on the end user device using a method called dynamic code loading (DCL), effectively turning the app into a backdoor. Earlier this May, ESET&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;a screen recording app named "iRecorder - Screen Recorder" that remained innocuous for nearly a year after it was first

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new version of malware called&nbsp; Rilide &nbsp;that targets Chromium-based web browsers to steal sensitive data and steal cryptocurrency.

Rilide was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by the cybersecurity company in April 2023, uncovering two different attack chains that made use of Ekipa RAT and Aurora Stealer to deploy rogue browser extensions capable of data and crypto theft. It's sold on dark web forums by an actor named "friezer" for $5,000.

Hundreds of Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway servers have been breached by malicious actors to deploy web shells, according to the Shadowserver Foundation. The non-profit&nbsp; said &nbsp;the attacks take advantage of&nbsp; CVE-2023-3519 , a critical code injection vulnerability that could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. The flaw, patched by Citrix last month, carries a CVSS score of 9.8. The&nbsp; largest number &nbsp;of impacted IP addresses are based in Germany, followed by France, Switzerland, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Japan, China, Austria, and Brazil. The&nbsp; exploitation &nbsp;of CVE-2023-3519 to deploy web shells was previously disclosed by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which&nbsp; said &nbsp;the attack was directed against an unnamed critical infrastructure organization in June 2023. The disclosure comes as GreyNoise&nbsp; said &nbsp;it detected three IP addresses&nbsp; attempting &nbsp;to exploit CVE-2023-24489 (CVSS score: 9.1), another critical flaw in Citrix ShareFile software that

The frequency and complexity of cyber threats are constantly evolving. At the same time, organizations are now collecting sensitive data that, if compromised, could result in severe financial and reputational damage.&nbsp; According to Cybersecurity Ventures , the cost of cybercrime is predicted to hit $8 trillion in 2023 and will grow to $10.5 trillion by 2025. There is also increasing public and regulatory scrutiny over data protection. Compliance regulations (such as PCI DSS and ISO 27001), as well as the need for a better understanding of your cybersecurity risks, are driving the need to conduct regular penetration tests.&nbsp; Pen testing helps to identify security flaws in your IT infrastructure before threat actors can detect and exploit them. This gives you visibility into the risks posed by potential attacks and enables you to take swift corrective action to address them. Here, we outline key factors to consider before, during, and post the penetration testing process. Pre-Penetrati

A hacktivist group known as&nbsp; Mysterious Team Bangladesh &nbsp;has been linked to over 750 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and 78 website defacements since June 2022.

Microsoft on Wednesday disclosed that it identified a set of highly targeted social engineering attacks mounted by a Russian nation-state threat actor using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats. The tech giant attributed the attacks to a group it tracks as&nbsp; Midnight Blizzard &nbsp;(previously Nobelium). It's also called APT29, BlueBravo, Cozy Bear, Iron Hemlock, and The Dukes. "In this latest activity, the threat actor uses previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities," the company&nbsp; said . "Using these domains from compromised tenants, Midnight Blizzard leverages Teams messages to send lures that attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and eliciting approval of multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts."

According to data compiled by SynSaber, a total of 670 ICS product flaws were reported via the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in the first half of 2023, down from&nbsp; 681 reported &nbsp;during the first half of 2022. Of the 670 CVEs, 88 are rated Critical, 349 are rated High, 215 are rated Medium, and 18 are rated Low in Severity. 227 of the flaws have no fixes in comparison to 88 in H1 2022. "Critical manufacturing (37.3% of total reported CVEs) and Energy (24.3% of the total reported) sectors are the most likely to be affected," the OT cybersecurity and asset monitoring company said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Other prominent industry verticals include water and wastewater systems, commercial facilities, communication

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new post-exploitation technique in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows the AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) to be run as a remote access trojan on Windows and Linux environments "The SSM agent, a legitimate tool used by admins to manage their instances, can be re-purposed by an attacker who has achieved high privilege access on an endpoint with SSM agent installed, to carry out malicious activities on an ongoing basis," Mitiga researchers Ariel Szarf and Or Aspir&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This allows an attacker who has compromised a machine, hosted on AWS or anywhere else, to maintain access to it and perform various malicious activities." SSM Agent is a&nbsp; software &nbsp;installed on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that makes it possible for administrators to update, manage, and configure their AWS resources through a unified interface.

Services offered by an obscure Iranian company known as Cloudzy are being leveraged by multiple threat actors, including cybercrime groups and nation-state crews.

Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a Python variant of a stealer malware&nbsp; NodeStealer &nbsp;that's equipped to fully take over Facebook business accounts as well as siphon cryptocurrency. Palo Alto Network Unit 42 said it detected the previously undocumented strain as part of a campaign that commenced in December 2022.

While the prior samples were written in JavaScript, the latest versions are coded in Python. "NodeStealer poses great risk for both individuals and organizations," Unit 42 researcher Lior Rochberger&nbsp; said . "Besides the direct impact on Facebook business accounts, which is mainly financial, the malware also steals credentials from browsers, which can be used for further attacks."

Various European customers of different banks are being targeted by an Android banking trojan called&nbsp; SpyNote &nbsp;as part of an aggressive campaign detected in June and July 2023. "The spyware is distributed through email phishing or smishing campaigns and the fraudulent activities are executed with a combination of remote access trojan (RAT) capabilities and vishing attack," Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical analysis released Monday. SpyNote , also called SpyMax, is similar to other Android banking Trojans in that it requires&nbsp; Android's accessibility permissions &nbsp;in order to grant itself other necessary permissions and gather sensitive data from infected devices. What makes the malware strain notable is its dual functions as spyware and perform bank fraud.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Data Security Posture Management is an approach to securing cloud data by ensuring that sensitive data always has the correct security posture - regardless of where it's been duplicated or moved to. So, what is DSPM? Here's a quick example: Let's say you've built an excellent&nbsp; security posture &nbsp;for your cloud data. For the sake of this example, your data is in production, it's protected behind a firewall, it's not publicly accessible, and your IAM controls have limited access properly. Now along comes a developer and replicates that data into a lower environment. What happens to that fine security posture you've built?&nbsp; Well, it's gone - and now the data is only protected by the security posture in that lower environment. So if that environment is exposed or improperly secured - so is all that sensitive data you've been trying to protect. Security postures just don't travel with their data .

A nation-state actor with links to China is suspected of being behind a series of attacks against industrial organizations in Eastern Europe that took place last year to siphon data stored on air-gapped systems. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky attributed the intrusions with medium to high confidence to a hacking crew called&nbsp; APT31 , which is also tracked under the monikers Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, and Violet Typhoon (formerly Zirconium), citing commonalities in the tactics observed. The attacks entailed the use of more than 15 distinct implants and their variants, broken down into three broad categories based on their ability to establish persistent remote access, gather sensitive information, and transmit the collected data to actor-controlled infrastructure. "One of the implant types appeared to be a sophisticated modular malware, aimed at profiling removable drives and contaminating them with a worm to exfiltrate data from isolated, or air-gapped, networks of indus

Cybercriminals Renting WikiLoader to Target Italian Organizations with Banking Trojan<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/cybercriminals-renting-wikiloader-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Organizations in Italy are the target of a new phishing campaign that leverages a new strain of malware called&nbsp; WikiLoader &nbsp;with an ultimate aim to install a banking trojan, stealer, and spyware referred to as&nbsp; Ursnif &nbsp;(aka Gozi). "It is a sophisticated downloader with the objective of installing a second malware payload," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. "The malware uses multiple mechanisms to evade detection and was likely developed as a malware that can be rented out to select cybercriminal threat actors." WikiLoader is so named due to the malware making a request to Wikipedia and checking that the response has the string "The Free." The enterprise security firm said it first detected the malware in the wild on December 27, 2022, in connection with an intrusion set mounted by a threat actor it tracks as&nbsp; TA544 , which is also known as Bamboo Spider and Zeus Panda. The campaigns are centered around the use of emails containing either Micro

New P2PInfect Worm Targets Redis Servers with Undocumented Breach Methods<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/new-p2pinfect-worm-targets-redis.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The P2PInfect peer-to-peer (P2) worm has been observed employing previously undocumented initial access methods to breach susceptible Redis servers and rope them into a botnet. "The malware compromises exposed instances of the Redis data store by exploiting the replication feature," Cado Security researchers Nate Bill and Matt Muir&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "A common attack pattern against Redis in cloud environments is to exploit this feature using a malicious instance to enable replication. This is achieved via connecting to an exposed Redis instance and issuing the SLAVEOF command." The Rust-based malware was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, calling out the malware's ability to exploit a critical Lua sandbox escape vulnerability ( CVE-2022-0543 , CVSS score: 10.0) to obtain a foothold into Redis instances. The campaign is believed to have commenced on or after June 29, 2023. However, the latest discovery suggests th

Patchwork Hackers Target Chinese Research Organizations Using EyeShell Backdoor<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/patchwork-hackers-target-chinese.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the hacking crew known as Patchwork have been spotted targeting universities and research organizations in China as part of a recently observed campaign. The activity, according to&nbsp; KnownSec 404 Team , entailed the use of a backdoor codenamed&nbsp; EyeShell . Patchwork , also known by the names Operation Hangover and Zinc Emerson, is suspected to be a threat group that operates on behalf of India. Active since at least December 2015, attack chains mounted by the outfit have a narrow focus and tend to single out Pakistan and China with custom implants such as BADNEWS via spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. The adversarial collective has been found to share tactical overlaps with other cyber-espionage groups with an Indian connection, including&nbsp; SideWinder &nbsp;and the&nbsp; DoNot Team . Earlier this May, Meta&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;that it took down 50 accounts on Facebook and Instagram operated by Patchwork, which took advantage of rogue messaging apps uploaded to the

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Demand for Virtual CISO services is soaring. According to Gartner, the use of vCISO services among small and mid-size businesses and non-regulated enterprises was expected to grow by a whopping 1900% in just one year, from only 1% in 2021 to 20% in 2022! Offering vCISO services can be especially attractive for MSPs and MSSPs. By addressing their customers' needs for proactive cyber resilience, they can generate a growing amount of recurring revenue from existing and new customers. And all while differentiating themselves from the competition. vCISO services also enable upselling of additional products and services the MSP or MSSP specializes in. However, not all MSPs and MSSPs fully understand how to provide vCISO services . Some may be unsure about which services are expected from them. Others may not realize they are already providing vCISO services and have the potential to effortlessly broaden their offerings into a complete vCISO suite or package it differently to make it more

More details have emerged about a botnet called&nbsp; AVRecon , which has been observed making use of compromised small office/home office (SOHO) routers as part of a multi-year campaign active since at least May 2021. AVRecon was&nbsp; first disclosed &nbsp;by Lumen Black Lotus Labs earlier this month as malware capable of executing additional commands and stealing victim's bandwidth for what appears to be an illegal proxy service made available for other actors. It has also surpassed QakBot in terms of scale, having infiltrated over 41,000 nodes located across 20 countries worldwide. "The malware has been used to create residential proxy services to shroud malicious activity such as password spraying, web-traffic proxying, and ad fraud," the researchers said in the report.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Android malware strain called&nbsp; CherryBlos &nbsp;has been observed making use of optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to gather sensitive data stored in pictures. CherryBlos, per&nbsp; Trend Micro , is distributed via bogus posts on social media platforms and comes with capabilities to steal cryptocurrency wallet-related credentials and act as a&nbsp; clipper &nbsp;to substitute wallet addresses when a victim copies a string matching a predefined format is copied to the clipboard. Once installed, the apps seek users' permissions to grant it accessibility permissions, which allows it to automatically grant itself additional permissions as required. As a defense evasion measure, users attempting to kill or uninstall the app by entering the Settings app are redirected back to the home screen. Besides displaying fake overlays on top of legitimate crypto wallet apps to steal credentials and make fraudulent fund transfers to an attacker-controlled address, CherryBlos utilizes OCR to recog

Apple has announced plans to require developers to submit reasons to use certain APIs in their apps starting later this year with the release of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS Sonoma, tvOS 17, and watchOS 10 to prevent their abuse for data collection. "This will help ensure that apps only use these APIs for their intended purpose," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. "As part of this process, you'll need to select one or more approved reasons that accurately reflect how your app uses the API, and your app can only use the API for the reasons you've selected." The APIs that&nbsp; require &nbsp;reasons for use relate to the following - File timestamp APIs System boot time APIs Disk space APIs Active keyboard APIs, and User defaults APIs The iPhone maker said it's making the move to ensure that such APIs are not abused by app developers to collect device signals to carry out&nbsp; fingerprinting , which could be employed to&nbsp; uniquely identify users &nbsp;across different a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday disclosed details of a "novel persistent backdoor" called&nbsp; SUBMARINE &nbsp;deployed by threat actors in connection with the hack on Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances. "SUBMARINE comprises multiple artifacts — including a SQL trigger, shell scripts, and a loaded library for a Linux daemon — that together enable execution with root privileges, persistence, command and control, and cleanup," the agency&nbsp; said . The findings come from an analysis of malware samples obtained from an unnamed organization that had been compromised by threat actors exploiting a critical flaw in ESG devices,&nbsp; CVE-2023-2868 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), which allows for remote command injection. Evidence gathered so far shows that the attackers behind the activity, a suspected China nexus-actor tracked by Mandiant as&nbsp; UNC4841 , leveraged the flaw as a zero-day in October 2022 to gain initial access to victim envir

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ivanti has disclosed yet another security flaw impacting Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron Core, that it said has been weaponized as part of an exploit chain by malicious actors in the wild. The new vulnerability, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-35081 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), impacts supported versions 11.10, 11.9, and 11.8, as well as those that are currently end-of-life (EoL). "CVE-2023-35081 enables an authenticated administrator to perform arbitrary file writes to the EPMM server," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "This vulnerability can be used in conjunction with&nbsp; CVE-2023-35078 , bypassing administrator authentication and ACLs restrictions (if applicable)." A successful exploit could allow a threat actor to write arbitrary files on the appliance, thereby enabling the malicious party to execute OS commands on the appliance as the tomcat user.

IcedID Malware Adapts and Expands Threat with Updated BackConnect Module<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/icedid-malware-adapts-and-expands.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors linked to the malware loader known as IcedID have made updates to the BackConnect (BC) module that's used for post-compromise activity on hacked systems, new findings from Team Cymru reveal. IcedID, also called BokBot , is a strain of malware similar to&nbsp; Emotet &nbsp;and&nbsp; QakBot &nbsp;that started off as a banking trojan in 2017, before switching to the role of an initial access facilitator for other payloads. Recent versions of the malware have been&nbsp; observed &nbsp;removing functionality related to online banking fraud to prioritize ransomware delivery. The BackConnect (BC) module,&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Netresec in October 2022, relies on a proprietary command-and-control (C2) protocol to exchange commands between a server and the infected host. The protocol, which comes with a VNC component for remote access, has also been identified in other malware such as the now-discontinued&nbsp; BazarLoader &nbsp;and QakBot. In December 2022, Team Cymru&nbsp; reported &nbsp;the discovery of 11 BC C2s a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As part of&nbsp; Checkmarx's mission &nbsp;to help organizations develop and deploy secure software, the Security Research team started looking at the security posture of major car manufacturers. Porsche has a well-established Vulnerability Reporting Policy (Disclosure Policy) [1] , it was considered in scope for our research, so we decided to start there, and see what we could find. What we found is an attack scenario that results from chaining security issues found on different Porsche's assets, a website and a GraphQL API, that could lead to data exfiltration. Data exfiltration is an attack technique that can impact businesses and organizations, regardless of size. When malicious users breach a company's or organization's systems and exfiltrate data, it can be a jarring and business-critical moment.

A legitimate Windows search feature is being exploited by malicious actors to download arbitrary payloads from remote servers and compromise targeted systems with remote access trojans such as AsyncRAT and Remcos RAT.

"Attackers are directing users to websites that exploit the 'search-ms' functionality using JavaScript hosted on the page," security researchers Mathanraj Thangaraju and Sijo Jacob&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday write-up.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Russian nation-state actor known as&nbsp; BlueBravo &nbsp;has been observed targeting diplomatic entities throughout Eastern Europe with the goal of delivering a new backdoor called GraphicalProton, exemplifying the continuous evolution of the threat. The phishing campaign is characterized by the use of legitimate internet services (LIS) for command-and-control (C2) obfuscation, Recorded Future said in a new report published Thursday. The activity was observed between March and May 2023. BlueBravo , also known by the names APT29, Cloaked Ursa, and Midnight Blizzard (formerly Nobelium), is attributed to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and has in the past&nbsp; used &nbsp;Dropbox, Firebase, Google Drive, Notion, and Trello to evade detection and stealthily establish communications with infected hosts. To that end, GraphicalProton is the latest addition to a long list of malware targeting diplomatic organizations after&nbsp; GraphicalNeutrino &nbsp;(aka SNOWYAMBER),&nbsp; HALFRIG, and QUARTERRIG .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Users of Metabase, a popular business intelligence and data visualization software package, are being advised to update to the latest version following the discovery of an "extremely severe" flaw that could result in pre-authenticated remote code execution on affected installations. Tracked as CVE-2023-38646 , the issue impacts open-source editions prior to 0.46.6.1 and Metabase Enterprise versions before 1.46.6.1. "An unauthenticated attacker can run arbitrary commands with the same privileges as the Metabase server on the server you are running Metabase on," Metabase said in an advisory released last week. The issue has also been addressed in the following older versions - 0.45.4.1 and 1.45.4.1 0.44.7.1 and 1.44.7.1, and 0.43.7.2 and 1.43.7.2 While there is no evidence that the issue has been exploited in the wild, data gathered by the Shadowserver Foundation shows that 5,488 out of the total 6,936 Metabase instances are vulnerable as of July 26, 202

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity agencies in Australia and the U.S. have&nbsp; published &nbsp;a joint cybersecurity advisory warning against security flaws in web applications that could be exploited by malicious actors to orchestrate data breach incidents and steal confidential data. This includes a specific class of bugs called Insecure Direct Object Reference ( IDOR ), a type of access control flaw that occurs when an application utilizes user-supplied input or an identifier for direct access to an internal resource, such as a database record, without any additional validations. A&nbsp; typical example &nbsp;of an IDOR flaw is the ability of a user to trivially change the URL (e.g., https://example[.]site/details.php?id= 12345 ) to obtain unauthorized data of another transaction (i.e., https://example[.]site/details.php?id= 67890 ). "IDOR vulnerabilities are access control vulnerabilities enabling malicious actors to modify or delete data or access sensitive data by issuing requests to a website or a web appli

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed two high-severity security flaws in the Ubuntu kernel that could pave the way for local privilege escalation attacks. Cloud security firm Wiz, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News, said the easy-to-exploit shortcomings have the potential to impact 40% of Ubuntu users. "The impacted Ubuntu versions are prevalent in the cloud as they serve as the default operating systems for multiple [cloud service providers]," security researchers Sagi Tzadik and Shir Tamari said. The&nbsp; vulnerabilities &nbsp;– tracked as CVE-2023-32629 and 2023-2640 (CVSS scores: 7.8) and dubbed&nbsp; GameOver(lay) &nbsp;– are present in a module called&nbsp; OverlayFS &nbsp;and arise as a result of inadequate permissions checks in certain scenarios, enabling a local attacker to gain elevated privileges.

A new malvertising campaign has been observed leveraging ads on Google Search and Bing to target users seeking IT tools like AnyDesk, Cisco AnyConnect VPN, and WinSCP, and trick them into downloading trojanized installers with an aim to breach enterprise networks and likely carry out future ransomware attacks. Dubbed&nbsp; Nitrogen , the "opportunistic" activity is designed to deploy second-stage attack tools such as Cobalt Strike, Sophos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday analysis. Nitrogen was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by eSentire in June 2023, detailing an infection chain that redirects users to compromised WordPress sites hosting malicious ISO image files that ultimately culminate in the delivery of Python scripts and Cobalt Strike Beacons onto the targeted system. Then earlier this month, Trend Micro&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;a similar attack sequence in which a fraudulent WinSCP application functioned as a stepping stone for a BlackCat ransomware attack.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As cloud applications are built, tested and updated, they wind their way through an ever-complex series of different tools and teams. Across hundreds or even thousands of technologies that make up the patchwork quilt of development and cloud environments, security processes are all too often applied in only the final phases of software development.&nbsp; Placing security at the very end of the production pipeline puts both devs and security on the back foot. Developers want to build and ship secure apps; security teams want to support this process by strengthening application security. However, today's security processes are legacy approaches that once worked brilliantly for the tight constraints of on-prem production, but struggle in quasi-public, ever-shifting cloud environments. As a result, security is an afterthought, and any attempt to squeeze siloed security into agile SDLC can&nbsp; swell the cost of patching by 600% . A new cloud security operating model is long overdue. Shift-le

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday approved new rules that require publicly traded companies to publicize details of a cyber attack within four days of identifying that it has a "material" impact on their finances, marking a major shift in how computer breaches are disclosed. "Whether a company loses a factory in a fire — or millions of files in a cybersecurity incident — it may be material to investors," SEC chair Gary Gensler&nbsp; said . "Currently, many public companies provide cybersecurity disclosure to investors. I think companies and investors alike, however, would benefit if this disclosure were made in a more consistent, comparable, and decision-useful way." To that end, the new obligations mandate that companies reveal the incident's nature, scope, and timing, as well as its impact. This disclosure, however, may be delayed by an additional period of up to 60 days should it be determined that giving out such specific

A deeper analysis of a recently discovered malware called&nbsp; Decoy Dog &nbsp;has revealed that it's a significant upgrade over the&nbsp; Pupy RAT , an open-source remote access trojan it's modeled on. "Decoy Dog has a full suite of powerful, previously unknown capabilities – including the ability to move victims to another controller, allowing them to maintain communication with compromised machines and remain hidden for long periods of time," Infoblox&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. "Some victims have actively communicated with a Decoy Dog server for over a year." Other new features allow the malware to execute arbitrary Java code on the client and connect to emergency controllers using a mechanism that's similar to a traditional DNS domain generation algorithm ( DGA ), with the Decoy Dog domains engineered to respond to replayed DNS queries from breached clients. The sophisticated toolkit was&nbsp; first discovered &nbsp;by the cybersecurity firm in early April 2023 after

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new study conducted by Uptycs has uncovered a stark increase in the distribution of information stealing (a.k.a. infostealer or stealer) malware. Incidents have more than doubled in Q1 2023, indicating an alarming trend that threatens global organizations. According to the new Uptycs' whitepaper,&nbsp; Stealers are Organization Killers , a variety of new info stealers have emerged this year, preying on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. Telegram has notably been used extensively by these malware authors for command, control, and data exfiltration. What is a Stealer? A stealer is a type of malware that targets its victim by stealing sensitive information that can include passwords, login credentials, and other personal data. After collecting such data, the stealer sends it to the threat actor's command and control (C2) system. RedLine and Vidar, two well-known stealers, took advantage of log-providing services to infiltrate private systems. RedLine primarily targets credenti

Tax-paying individuals in Mexico and Chile have been targeted by a Mexico-based cybercrime group that goes by the name&nbsp; Fenix &nbsp;to breach targeted networks and steal valuable data. A key hallmark of the operation entails cloning official portals of the Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT) in Mexico and the Servicio de Impuestos Internos (SII) in Chile and redirecting potential victims to those sites.&nbsp; "These fake websites prompt users to download a supposed security tool, claiming it will enhance their portal navigation safety," Metabase Q security researchers Gerardo Corona and Julio Vidal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a recent analysis. "However, unbeknownst to the victims, this download actually installs the initial stage of malware, ultimately enabling the theft of sensitive information such as credentials."

Following the footsteps of&nbsp; WormGPT , threat actors are advertising yet another cybercrime generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool dubbed&nbsp; FraudGPT &nbsp;on various dark web marketplaces and Telegram channels.

The cybersecurity firm said the offering has been circulating since at least July 22, 2023, for a subscription cost of $200 a month (or $1,000 for six months and $1,700 for a year). "If your [sic] looking for a Chat GPT alternative designed to provide a wide range of exclusive tools, features, and capabilities tailored to anyone's individuals with no boundaries then look no further!," claims the actor, who goes by the online alias CanadianKingpin.

A new malware family called&nbsp; Realst &nbsp;has become the latest to target Apple macOS systems, with a third of the samples already designed to infect macOS 14 Sonoma, the upcoming major release of the operating system. Written in the Rust programming language, the malware is distributed in the form of bogus blockchain games and is capable of "emptying crypto wallets and stealing stored password and browser data" from both Windows and macOS machines. Realst was first discovered in the wild by security researcher&nbsp; iamdeadlyz . "Realst Infostealer is distributed via malicious websites advertising fake blockchain games with names such as Brawl Earth, WildWorld, Dawnland, Destruction, Evolion, Pearl, Olymp of Reptiles, and SaintLegend," SentinelOne security researcher Phil Stokes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A severe privilege escalation issue impacting MikroTik RouterOS could be weaponized by remote malicious actors to execute arbitrary code and seize full control of vulnerable devices. Cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-30799 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.1), the shortcoming is expected to put approximately 500,000 and 900,000 RouterOS systems at risk of exploitation via their web and/or Winbox interfaces, respectively, VulnCheck disclosed in a Tuesday report. "CVE-2023-30799 does require authentication," security researcher Jacob Baines&nbsp; said . "In fact, the vulnerability itself is a simple privilege escalation from admin to 'super-admin' which results in access to an arbitrary function. Acquiring credentials to RouterOS systems is easier than one might expect." This is because the Mikrotik RouterOS operating system does not offer any protection against password brute-force attacks and ships with a well-known default "admin" user, with its password being an empty string

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
North Korean nation-state actors affiliated with the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) have been attributed to the&nbsp; JumpCloud hack &nbsp;following an operational security (OPSEC) blunder that exposed their actual IP address. Google-owned threat intelligence firm Mandiant attributed the activity to a threat actor it tracks under the name UNC4899, which likely shares overlaps with clusters already being monitored as Jade Sleet and TraderTraitor, a group with a history of striking blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. UNC4899 also overlaps with&nbsp; APT43 , another hacking crew associated with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) that was unmasked earlier this March as conducting a series of campaigns to gather intelligence and siphon cryptocurrency from targeted companies. The adversarial collective's modus operandi is characterized by the use of Operational Relay Boxes ( ORBs ) using L2TP IPsec tunnels along with commercial VPN providers to disguise the attacker's

As the number of people using macOS keeps going up, so does the desire of hackers to take advantage of flaws in Apple's operating system.&nbsp; What Are the Rising Threats to macOS? There is a common misconception among macOS fans that Apple devices are immune to hacking and malware infection. However, users have been facing more and more dangers recently. Inventive attackers are specifically targeting Mac systems, as seen with the "Geacon" Cobalt Strike tool attack. This tool enables them to perform malicious actions such as data theft, privilege elevation, and remote device control, placing the security and privacy of Mac users at grave risk. Earlier this year, researchers also uncovered the MacStealer malware, which also stole sensitive data from Apple users. Documents, iCloud keychain data, browser cookies, credit card credentials – nothing is safe from the prying eyes.&nbsp; But that's not all.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A set of five security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the Terrestrial Trunked Radio ( TETRA ) standard for radio communication used widely by government entities and critical infrastructure sectors, including what's believed to be an intentional backdoor that could have potentially exposed sensitive information. The issues, discovered by Midnight Blue in 2021 and held back until now, have been collectively called&nbsp; TETRA:BURST . There is no conclusive evidence to determine that the vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild to date. "Depending on infrastructure and device configurations, these vulnerabilities allow for real time decryption, harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks, message injection, user deanonymization, or session key pinning," the Netherlands-based cybersecurity company&nbsp; said . Standardized by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in 1995, TETRA is used in more than 100 countries and as a police radio communication system

How do you overcome today's talent gap in cybersecurity? This is a crucial issue — particularly when you find executive leadership or the board asking pointed questions about your security team's ability to defend the organization against new and current threats. This is why many security leaders find themselves turning to managed security services like MDR ( managed detection and response ), which can offer an immediate solution. The right MDR partner can act as an extension of your existing team, while offering a fast and budget-friendly option for uplevelling security at organizations of virtually any size. Here's a look at common staffing challenges that MDR helps solve: Overcoming Cybersecurity Talent Challenges From stopping ransomware to securing the attack surface of the environment, most security teams have more to do than they can manage. This leads to security gaps that increase both cyber risk and frustration for stakeholders across the business. The chall

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new security vulnerability has been discovered in AMD's Zen 2 architecture-based processors that could be exploited to extract sensitive data such as encryption keys and passwords. Discovered by Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy, the flaw – codenamed&nbsp; Zenbleed &nbsp;and tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-20593 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.5) – allows data exfiltration at the rate of 30 kb per core, per second. The issue is part of a broader category of weaknesses called&nbsp; speculative execution attacks , in which the optimization technique widely used in modern CPUs is abused to access cryptographic keys from CPU registers. "Under specific microarchitectural circumstances, a register in 'Zen 2' CPUs may not be written to 0 correctly," AMD&nbsp; explained &nbsp;in an advisory. "This may cause data from another process and/or thread to be stored in the YMM register , which may allow an attacker to potentially access sensitive information."

Apple has&nbsp; rolled out security updates &nbsp;to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and Safari to address several security vulnerabilities, including one actively exploited zero-day bug in the wild. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38606 , the shortcoming resides in the kernel and permits a malicious app to modify sensitive kernel state potentially. The company said it was addressed with improved state management. "Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited against versions of iOS released before iOS 15.7.1," the tech giant noted in its advisory. It's worth noting that CVE-2023-38606 is the third security vulnerability discovered in connection with&nbsp; Operation Triangulation , a sophisticated mobile cyber espionage campaign targeting iOS devices since 2019 using a zero-click exploit chain. The other two zero-days,&nbsp; CVE-2023-32434 and CVE-2023-32435 , were patched by Apple last month. Kaspersky researchers Valentin Pashkov, Mikhail Vinogradov, Georgy Kuc

Zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows Installers for the Atera remote monitoring and management software could act as a springboard to launch privilege escalation attacks. The flaws, discovered by Mandiant on February 28, 2023, have been assigned the identifiers&nbsp; CVE-2023-26077 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-26078 , with the issues remediated in versions 1.8.3.7 and 1.8.4.9 released by Atera on April 17, 2023, and June 26, 2023, respectively. "The ability to initiate an operation from a NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context can present potential security risks if not properly managed," security researcher Andrew Oliveau&nbsp; said . "For instance, misconfigured&nbsp; Custom Actions &nbsp;running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM can be exploited by attackers to execute local privilege escalation attacks." Successful exploitation of such weaknesses could pave the way for the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

The healthcare industry is under a constant barrage of cyberattacks. It has traditionally been one of the most frequently targeted industries, and things haven't changed in 2023. The U.S. Government's Office for Civil Rights reported&nbsp; 145 data breaches &nbsp;in the United States during the first quarter of this year. That follows 707 incidents a year ago, during which over 50 million records were stolen. Health records often include names, birth dates, social security numbers, and addresses. This treasure trove of data is used in identity theft, tax fraud, and other crimes. It is the high value of the data that makes healthcare applications such a promising target. The healthcare industry was hesitant to adopt SaaS applications. However, SaaS applications lead to better collaboration among medical professionals, leading to improved patient outcomes. That, combined with SaaS's ability to reduce costs and improve financial performance, has led to the industry fully embracing SaaS solutions

The recent attack against&nbsp; Microsoft's email infrastructure &nbsp;by a Chinese nation-state actor referred to as Storm-0558 is said to have a broader scope than previously thought. According to cloud security company Wiz, the inactive Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key used to forge Azure Active Directory (Azure AD or AAD) tokens to gain illicit access to Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Outlook.com could also have allowed the adversary to forge access tokens for various types of Azure AD applications. This&nbsp; includes &nbsp;every application that supports personal account authentication, such as OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams; customers applications that support the "Login with Microsoft functionality," and multi-tenant applications in certain conditions. "Everything in the world of Microsoft leverages Azure Active Directory auth tokens for access," Ami Luttwak, chief technology officer and co-founder of Wiz, said in a statement.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Regardless of the country, local government is essential in most citizens' lives. It provides many day-to-day services and handles various issues. Therefore, their effects can be far-reaching and deeply felt when security failures occur. In early 2023, Oakland, California, &nbsp;fell victim to a ransomware attack . Although city officials have not disclosed how the attack occurred, experts suspect a phishing email is the most likely cause. As a result, city officials brought down their servers to contain the attack. Governments have been the target to many ransomware attacks &nbsp;and breaches. As most local governments maintain a small IT staff, there is potential for shared passwords, reused credentials, and a lack of multi-factor authentication security, exposing vulnerabilities for a breach.&nbsp; Oakland is Breached It was first noticed on a Wednesday evening in early February; when Oakland, California city officials quickly took most services' backend servers offline and posted a m

Several distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnets have been observed exploiting a critical flaw in Zyxel devices that came to light in April 2023 to gain remote control of vulnerable systems. "Through the capture of exploit traffic, the attacker's IP address was identified, and it was determined that the attacks were occurring in multiple regions, including Central America, North America, East Asia, and South Asia," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . The flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-28771 (CVSS score: 9.8), is a command injection bug affecting multiple firewall models that could potentially allow an unauthorized actor to execute arbitrary code by sending a specifically crafted packet to the targeted appliance. Last month, the Shadowserver Foundation&nbsp; warned &nbsp;that the flaw was being "actively exploited to build a Mirai-like botnet" at least since May 26, 2023, an indication of how abuse of&nbsp; servers running unpatched software &nbsp;is on the rise.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an advisory on Thursday warning that the newly disclosed critical security flaw in Citrix NetScaler Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Gateway devices is being abused to drop web shells on vulnerable systems. "In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day to drop a web shell on a critical infrastructure organization's non-production environment NetScaler ADC appliance," the agency&nbsp; said . "The web shell enabled the actors to perform discovery on the victim's active directory (AD) and collect and exfiltrate AD data. The actors attempted to move laterally to a domain controller but network segmentation controls for the appliance blocked movement." The shortcoming in question is&nbsp; CVE-2023-3519 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), a code injection bug that could result in unauthenticated remote code execution.

Two more security flaws have been disclosed in AMI MegaRAC Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) software that, if successfully exploited, could allow threat actors to remotely commandeer vulnerable servers and deploy malware. "These new vulnerabilities range in severity from High to Critical, including unauthenticated remote code execution and unauthorized device access with superuser permissions," Eclypsium researchers Vlad Babkin and Scott Scheferman said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "They can be exploited by remote attackers having access to Redfish remote management interfaces, or from a compromised host operating system." To make matters worse, the shortcomings could also be weaponized to drop persistent firmware implants that are immune to operating system reinstalls and hard drive replacements, brick motherboard components, cause physical damage through overvolting attacks, and induce indefinite reboot loops.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mallox ransomware activities in 2023 have witnessed a 174% increase when compared to the previous year, new findings from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 reveal. "Mallox ransomware, like many other ransomware threat actors, follows the double extortion trend: stealing data before encrypting an organization's files, and then threatening to publish the stolen data on a leak site as leverage to convince victims to pay the ransom fee," security researchers Lior Rochberger and Shimi Cohen&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report shared with The Hacker News. Mallox is linked to a threat actor that's also linked to&nbsp; other ransomware strains , such as TargetCompany, Tohnichi, Fargo, and, most recently, Xollam. It first burst onto the scene in June 2021. Some of the prominent sectors targeted by Mallox are manufacturing, professional and legal services, and wholesale and retail. A notable aspect of the group is its pattern of exploiting poorly secured MS-SQL servers via&nbsp; dictionary attacks &nbsp;as

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple security flaws have been disclosed in Apache OpenMeetings, a web conferencing solution, that could be potentially exploited by malicious actors to seize control of admin accounts and run malicious code on susceptible servers. "Attackers can bring the application into an unexpected state, which allows them to take over any user account, including the admin account," Sonar vulnerability researcher Stefan Schiller&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The acquired admin privileges can further be leveraged to exploit another vulnerability allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Apache OpenMeetings server." Following responsible disclosure on March 20, 2023, the vulnerabilities were addressed with the release of&nbsp; Openmeetings version 7.1.0 &nbsp;that was released on May 9, 2023. The list of three flaws is as follows - CVE-2023-28936 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 5.3) - Insufficient check of invitation hash CVE-2023-29032 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.1) - An authenti

An analysis of the indicators of compromise ( IoCs ) associated with the JumpCloud hack has uncovered evidence pointing to the involvement of North Korean state-sponsored groups, in a style that's reminiscent of the&nbsp; supply chain attack targeting 3CX . The findings come from SentinelOne, which&nbsp; mapped out &nbsp;the infrastructure pertaining to the intrusion to uncover underlying patterns. It's worth noting that JumpCloud, last week,&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the attack to an unnamed "sophisticated nation-state sponsored threat actor." "The North Korean threat actors demonstrate a high level of creativity and strategic awareness in their targeting strategies," SentinelOne security researcher Tom Hegel told The Hacker News.

If it seems like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) has been around forever, it's because it has (at least compared to the many technologies that rise and fall within just a few years.) The initial version, known as "Remote Desktop Protocol 4.0," was released in 1996 as part of the Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server edition and allowed users to remotely access and control Windows-based computers over a network connection.&nbsp; In the intervening decades, RDP has become a widely used protocol for remote access and administration of Windows-based systems. RDP plays a crucial role in enabling remote work, IT support, and system management and has served as the foundation for various remote desktop and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solutions.&nbsp; The downside of RDP's widespread use is that a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in an RDP gateway can have severe consequences, potentially leading to significant damage and compromising the security and integrity of the affec

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The defense sector in Ukraine and Eastern Europe has been targeted by a novel .NET-based backdoor called&nbsp; DeliveryCheck &nbsp;(aka CAPIBAR or GAMEDAY) that's capable of delivering next-stage payloads. The Microsoft threat intelligence team, in&nbsp; collaboration &nbsp;with the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA), attributed the attacks to a Russian nation-state actor known as&nbsp; Turla , which is also tracked under the names Iron Hunter, Secret Blizzard (formerly Krypton), Uroburos, Venomous Bear, and Waterbug. It's linked to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB). "DeliveryCheck is distributed via email as documents with malicious macros," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets. "It persists via a scheduled task that downloads and launches it in memory.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new cloud targeting, peer-to-peer (P2P) worm called&nbsp; P2PInfect &nbsp;that targets vulnerable Redis instances for follow-on exploitation. "P2PInfect exploits Redis servers running on both Linux and Windows Operating Systems making it more scalable and potent than other worms," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers William Gamazo and Nathaniel Quist&nbsp; said . "This worm is also written in Rust, a highly scalable and cloud-friendly programming language." It's estimated that as many as 934 unique Redis systems may be vulnerable to the threat. The first known instance of P2PInfect was detected on July 11, 2023. A notable characteristic of the worm is its ability to infects vulnerable Redis instances by exploiting a critical Lua sandbox escape vulnerability,&nbsp; CVE-2022-0543 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 10.0), which has been previously exploited to deliver multiple&nbsp; malware families &nbsp;such as&nbsp; Muhstik ,&nbsp; Redigo , and&nbsp; HeadCrab &nbsp;over the past ye

Attack surfaces are growing faster than security teams can keep up. To stay ahead, you need to know what's exposed and where attackers are most likely to strike. With cloud migration dramatically increasing the number of internal and external targets, prioritizing threats and managing your attack surface from an attacker's perspective has never been more important. Let's look at why it's growing, and how to monitor and manage it properly with tools like&nbsp; Intruder . What is your attack surface? First, it's important to understand that your attack surface is the sum of your digital assets that are 'exposed' – whether the digital assets are secure or vulnerable, known or unknown, in active use or not. This attack surface changes continuously over time, and includes digital assets that are on-premises, in the cloud, in subsidiary networks, and in third-party environments. In short, it's anything that a hacker can attack.&nbsp; What is attack surface managemen

U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have&nbsp; released &nbsp;a set of recommendations to address security concerns with 5G standalone network slicing and harden them against possible threats. "The threat landscape in 5G is dynamic; due to this, advanced monitoring, auditing, and other analytical capabilities are required to meet certain levels of network slicing service level requirements over time," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Security Agency (NSA)&nbsp; said . 5G is the fifth-generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, offering increased data speeds and lower latency. Network slicing is an architectural model that allows mobile service providers to partition their network up into several independent "slices" in order to create virtual networks that cater to different clients and use cases.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The prolific China-linked nation-state actor known as APT41 has been linked to two previously undocumented strains of Android spyware called WyrmSpy and DragonEgg. "Known for its exploitation of web-facing applications and infiltration of traditional endpoint devices, an established threat actor like APT 41 including mobile in its arsenal of malware shows how mobile endpoints are high-value targets with coveted corporate and personal data," Lookout&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. APT41, also tracked under the names Axiom, Blackfly, Brass Typhoon (formerly Barium), Bronze Atlas, HOODOO, Wicked Panda, and Winnti, is known to be operational since at least 2007, targeting a wide range of industries to conduct intellectual property theft. Recent attacks mounted by the adversarial collective have&nbsp; leveraged &nbsp;an open-source red teaming tool known as Google Command and Control (GC2) as part of attacks aimed at media and job platforms in Taiwan and Italy.

On April 5, 2023, the FBI and Dutch National Police&nbsp; announced the takedown of Genesis Market , one of the largest dark web marketplaces. The operation, dubbed "Operation Cookie Monster," resulted in the arrest of 119 people and the seizure of over $1M in cryptocurrency. You can read the FBI's warrant&nbsp; here &nbsp;for details specific to this case. In light of these events, I'd like to discuss how OSINT can assist with dark web investigations. The Dark Web's anonymity attracts a variety of users, from whistleblowers and political activists to cybercriminals and terrorists. There are several techniques that can be used to try and identify the individuals behind these sites and personas. Technical Vulnerabilities While not considered OSINT, there have been instances when technical vulnerabilities have existed in the technology used to host dark websites. These vulnerabilities may exist in the software itself or be due to misconfigurations, but they can sometimes revea

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a privilege escalation vulnerability in Google Cloud that could enable malicious actors tamper with application images and infect users, leading to supply chain attacks. The issue, dubbed&nbsp; Bad.Build , is rooted in the&nbsp; Google Cloud Build service , according to cloud security firm Orca, which discovered and reported the issue. "By abusing the flaw and enabling an impersonation of the default Cloud Build service, attackers can manipulate images in the Google Artifact Registry and inject malicious code," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement shared with The Hacker News. "Any applications built from the manipulated images are then affected and, if the malformed applications are meant to be deployed on customer's environments, the risk crosses from the supplying organization's environment to their customers' environments, constituting a major supply chain risk."

The U.S. government on Tuesday added two foreign commercial spyware vendors, Cytrox and Intellexa, to an economic blocklist for weaponizing cyber exploits to gain unauthorized access to devices and "threatening the privacy and security of individuals and organizations worldwide." This includes the companies' corporate holdings in Hungary (Cytrox Holdings Crt), North Macedonia (Cytrox AD), Greece (Intellexa S.A.), and Ireland (Intellexa Limited). By adding to the economic denylist, it prohibits U.S. companies from transacting with these businesses. "Recognizing the increasingly key role that surveillance technology plays in enabling campaigns of repression and other human rights abuses, the Commerce Department's action today targets these entities' ability to access commodities, software, and technology that could contribute to the development of surveillance tools that pose a risk of misuse in violations or abuses of human rights," the Bureau of Indus

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unidentified threat actor compromised an application used by multiple entities in Pakistan to deliver&nbsp; ShadowPad , a successor to the PlugX backdoor that's commonly associated with&nbsp; Chinese hacking crews . Targets included a Pakistan government entity, a public sector bank, and a telecommunications provider, according to Trend Micro. The infections took place between mid-February 2022 and September 2022. The cybersecurity company said the incident could be the result of a supply-chain attack, in which a legitimate piece of software used by targets of interest is trojanized to deploy malware capable of gathering sensitive information from compromised systems. The attack chain takes the form of a malicious installer for&nbsp; E-Office , an application developed by the National Information Technology Board (NITB) of Pakistan to help government departments go paperless. It's currently not clear how the backdoored E-Office installer was delivered to the targets. That said, there&amp;

The financially motivated threat actor known as FIN8 has been observed using a "revamped" version of a backdoor called&nbsp; Sardonic &nbsp;to deliver the&nbsp; BlackCat ransomware . According to the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, the development is an attempt on the part of the e-crime group to diversify its focus and maximize profits from infected entities. The intrusion attempt took place in December 2022. FIN8 is being tracked by the cybersecurity company under the name Syssphinx. Known to be active since at least 2016, the adversary was originally attributed to attacks targeting point-of-sale (PoS) systems using malware such as PUNCHTRACK and BADHATCH. The group resurfaced after more than a year in March 2021 with an updated version of BADHATCH, following it up with a completely new bespoke implant called Sardonic , which was disclosed by Bitdefender in August 2021. "The C++-based Sardonic backdoor has the ability to harvest system information and execute co

Conor Brian Fitzpatrick , the owner of the now-defunct BreachForums website, has pleaded guilty to charges related to his operation of the cybercrime forum as well as having child pornography images. The development,&nbsp; first reported &nbsp;by DataBreaches.net last week, comes nearly four months after Fitzpatrick (aka pompompurin) was&nbsp; formally charged &nbsp;in the U.S. with conspiracy to commit access device fraud and possession of child pornography. BreachForums, launched in March 2022, operated as an illegal marketplace that allowed its members to trade hacked or stolen databases, enabling other criminal actors to gain unauthorized access to target systems. It was shut down in March 2023 shortly after&nbsp; Fitzpatrick's arrest &nbsp;in New York. As many as 888 databases consisting of 14 billion individual records are estimated to have been found in total. The forum had over 333,000 members prior to its takedown.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are actively exploiting a recently disclosed critical security flaw in the WooCommerce Payments WordPress plugin as part of a massive targeted campaign. The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-28121 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), is a case of authentication bypass that enables unauthenticated attackers to impersonate arbitrary users and perform some actions as the impersonated user, including an administrator, potentially leading to site takeover. "Large-scale attacks against the vulnerability, assigned CVE-2023-28121, began on Thursday, July 14, 2023 and continued over the weekend, peaking at 1.3 million attacks against 157,000 sites on Saturday, July 16, 2023," Wordfence security researcher Ram Gall&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday post. Versions 4.8.0 through 5.6.1 of WooCommerce Payments are vulnerable. The plugin is installed on over 600,000 sites. Patches for the bug were released by WooCommerce back in March 2023, with WordPress issuing auto-updates to sites using affected versions of

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A little over a week after&nbsp; JumpCloud reset API keys of customers &nbsp;impacted by a security incident, the company said the intrusion was the work of a sophisticated nation-state actor. The adversary "gained unauthorized access to our systems to target a small and specific set of our customers," Bob Phan, chief information security officer (CISO) at JumpCloud,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post-mortem report. "The attack vector used by the threat actor has been mitigated." The U.S. enterprise software firm said it identified anomalous activity on June 27, 2023, on an internal orchestration system, which it traced back to a spear-phishing campaign mounted by the attacker on June 22. While JumpCloud said it took security steps to shield its network by rotating credentials and rebuilding its systems, it wasn't until July 5 when it detected "unusual activity" in the commands framework for a small set of customers, prompting a forced-rotation of all admin API keys.

Threat actors are taking advantage of Android's&nbsp; WebAPK technology &nbsp;to trick unsuspecting users into installing malicious web apps on Android phones that are designed to capture sensitive personal information.

The application impersonates PKO Bank Polski, a multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in Warsaw. Details of the campaign were&nbsp; first shared &nbsp;by Polish cybersecurity firm RIFFSEC.

Microsoft Word documents exploiting known remote code execution flaws are being used as phishing lures to drop malware called&nbsp; LokiBot &nbsp;on compromised systems. "LokiBot, also known as Loki PWS, has been a well-known information-stealing Trojan active since 2015," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . "It primarily targets Windows systems and aims to gather sensitive information from infected machines." The cybersecurity company, which spotted the campaign in May 2023, said the attacks take advantage of&nbsp; CVE-2021-40444 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2022-30190 &nbsp;(aka Follina) to achieve code execution. The Word file that weaponizes CVE-2021-40444 contains an external GoFile link embedded within an XML file that leads to the download of an HTML file, which exploits Follina to download a next-stage payload, an injector module written in Visual Basic that decrypts and launches LokiBot.

"As a vector of primary compromise, for the most part, emails and messages in messengers (Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal) are used, in most cases, using previously compromised accounts," the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis of the group published last week. Gamaredon , also called Aqua Blizzard, Armageddon, Shuckworm, or UAC-0010, is a&nbsp; state-sponsored actor &nbsp;with ties to the SBU Main Office in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. The group is estimated to have infected thousands of government computers. It is also one of the&nbsp; many Russian hacking crews &nbsp;that have maintained an&nbsp; active presence &nbsp;since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war in February 2022, leveraging phishing campaigns to deliver PowerShell backdoors such as GammaSteel to conduct recon

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
With generative artificial intelligence (AI) becoming all the rage these days, it's perhaps not surprising that the technology has been repurposed by malicious actors to their own advantage, enabling avenues for accelerated cybercrime. According to findings from SlashNext, a new generative AI cybercrime tool called&nbsp; WormGPT &nbsp;has been advertised on underground forums as a way for adversaries to launch sophisticated phishing and business email compromise ( BEC ) attacks. "This tool presents itself as a blackhat alternative to GPT models, designed specifically for malicious activities," security researcher Daniel Kelley&nbsp; said . "Cybercriminals can use such technology to automate the creation of highly convincing fake emails, personalized to the recipient, thus increasing the chances of success for the attack." The author of the software has described it as the "biggest enemy of the well-known ChatGPT" that "lets you do all sorts of illegal stuff.

Microsoft on Friday said a validation error in its source code allowed for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tokens to be forged by a malicious actor known as&nbsp; Storm-0558 &nbsp;using a Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key to breach two dozen organizations. "Storm-0558 acquired an inactive MSA consumer signing key and used it to forge authentication tokens for Azure AD enterprise and MSA consumer to access OWA and Outlook.com," the tech giant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deeper analysis of the campaign. "The method by which the actor acquired the key is a matter of ongoing investigation." "Though the key was intended only for MSA accounts, a validation issue allowed this key to be trusted for signing Azure AD tokens. This issue has been corrected." It's not immediately clear if the token validation issue was exploited as a "zero-day vulnerability" or if Microsoft was already aware of the problem before it came under in-the-wild abuse.

Critical Security Flaws Uncovered in Honeywell Experion DCS and QuickBlox Services<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/critical-security-flaws-uncovered-in.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in various services, including Honeywell Experion distributed control system (DCS) and QuickBlox, that, if successfully exploited, could result in severe compromise of affected systems. Dubbed Crit.IX, the nine flaws in the Honeywell Experion DCS platform allow for "unauthorized remote code execution, which means an attacker would have the power to take over the devices and alter the operation of the DCS controller, whilst also hiding the alterations from the engineering workstation that manages the controller," Armis said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. Put differently, the issues relate to lack of encryption and adequate authentication mechanisms in a proprietary protocol called Control Data Access (CDA) that's used to communicate between Experion Servers and C300 controllers, effectively enabling a threat actor to take over the devices and alter the operation of the DCS controller.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As security practices continue to evolve, one primary concern persists in the minds of security professionals—the risk of employees unintentionally or deliberately exposing vital information. Insider threats, whether originating from deliberate actions or accidental incidents, pose a significant challenge to safeguarding sensitive data. To effectively address insider risks, organizations must adopt a holistic approach that encompasses technical, procedural, and human elements. While access controls, encryption, and monitoring systems are crucial for identifying and mitigating unauthorized access and suspicious activities, the increasing prevalence of cloud-based environments and the surge in SaaS application usage demand a fresh perspective on Insider Risk Management from a SaaS security standpoint. Stay ahead of the game by embracing the SaaS security lens. Join us for an enlightening webinar where we will demonstrate how security practitioners can proactively adapt their approach

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
All-In-One Security (AIOS), a WordPress plugin installed on over one million sites, has issued a security update after a bug introduced in version 5.1.9 of the software caused users' passwords being added to the database in plaintext format. "A malicious site administrator (i.e. a user already logged into the site as an admin) could then have read them," UpdraftPlus, the maintainers of AIOS,&nbsp; said . "This would be a problem if those site administrators were to try out those passwords on other services where your users might have used the same password. If those other services' logins are not protected by two-factor authentication, this could be a risk to the affected website." The issue surfaced nearly three weeks ago when a user of the plugin&nbsp; reported &nbsp;the behavior, stating they were "absolutely shocked that a security plugin is making such a basic security 101 error."

A malicious actor has been linked to a cloud credential stealing campaign in June 2023 that's focused on Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, marking the adversary's expansion in targeting beyond Amazon Web Services (AWS). The findings come from&nbsp; SentinelOne &nbsp;and&nbsp; Permiso , which said the "campaigns share similarity with tools attributed to the notorious TeamTNT cryptojacking crew," although it emphasized that "attribution remains challenging with script-based tools." They also overlap with an ongoing TeamTNT campaign&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by Aqua called Silentbob that leverages misconfigured cloud services to drop malware as part of what's said to be a testing effort, while also linking&nbsp; SCARLETEEL &nbsp;attacks to the threat actor, citing infrastructure commonalities.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware strain has been found covertly targeting small office/home office (SOHO) routers for more than two years, infiltrating over 70,000 devices and creating a botnet with 40,000 nodes spanning 20 countries. Lumen Black Lotus Labs has dubbed the malware&nbsp; AVrecon , making it the third such strain to focus on SOHO routers after&nbsp; ZuoRAT &nbsp;and&nbsp; HiatusRAT &nbsp;over the past year. "This makes AVrecon one of the largest SOHO router-targeting botnets ever seen," the company&nbsp; said . "The purpose of the campaign appears to be the creation of a covert network to quietly enable a range of criminal activities from password spraying to digital advertising fraud." A majority of the infections are located in the U.K. and the U.S., followed by Argentina, Nigeria, Brazil, Italy, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Russia, and South Africa, among others. AVrecon was&nbsp; first highlighted &nbsp;by Kaspersky senior security researcher Ye (Seth) Jin in May 2021, indicating that the malware has

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government entities, military organizations, and civilian users in Ukraine and Poland have been targeted as part of a series of campaigns designed to steal sensitive data and gain persistent remote access to the infected systems. The intrusion set, which stretches from April 2022 to July 2023, leverages phishing lures and decoy documents to deploy a downloader malware called PicassoLoader, which acts as a conduit to launch Cobalt Strike Beacon and njRAT. "The attacks used a multistage infection chain initiated with malicious Microsoft Office documents, most commonly using Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint file formats," Cisco Talos researcher Vanja Svajcer&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "This was followed by an executable downloader and payload concealed in an image file, likely to make its detection more difficult." Some &nbsp;of the&nbsp; activities &nbsp;have been attributed to a threat actor called GhostWriter (aka UAC-0057 or UNC1151), whose priorities are said to align with the Be

As many as 196 hosts have been infected as part of an aggressive cloud campaign mounted by the TeamTNT group called&nbsp; Silentbob . "The botnet run by TeamTNT has set its sights on Docker and Kubernetes environments, Redis servers, Postgres databases, Hadoop clusters, Tomcat and Nginx servers, Weave Scope, SSH, and Jupyter applications," Aqua security researchers Ofek Itach and Assaf Morag&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The focus this time seems to be more on infecting systems and testing the botnet, rather than deploying cryptominers for profit." The development arrives a week after the cloud security company&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;an intrusion set linked to the TeamTNT group that targets exposed JupyterLab and Docker APIs to deploy the Tsunami malware and hijack system resources to run a cryptocurrency miner.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In a sign that cybersecurity researchers continue to be under the radar of malicious actors, a proof-of-concept (PoC) has been discovered on GitHub, concealing a backdoor with a "crafty" persistence method. "In this instance, the PoC is a wolf in sheep's clothing, harboring malicious intent under the guise of a harmless learning tool," Uptycs researchers Nischay Hegde and Siddartha Malladi&nbsp; said . "Operating as a downloader, it silently dumps and executes a Linux bash script, all the while disguising its operations as a kernel-level process." The&nbsp; repository &nbsp;masquerades as a PoC for&nbsp; CVE-2023-35829 , a recently disclosed high-severity flaw in the Linux kernel. It has since been taken down, but not before it was forked 25 times.&nbsp; Another PoC &nbsp;shared by the same account, ChriSanders22, for&nbsp; CVE-2023-20871 , a privilege escalation bug impacting VMware Fusion, was forked twice.

Ransomware has emerged as the only cryptocurrency-based crime to grow in 2023, with cybercriminals extorting nearly $175.8 million more than they did a year ago, according to findings from Chainalysis. "Ransomware attackers are on pace for their second-biggest year ever, having extorted at least $449.1 million through June," the blockchain analytics firm&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a midyear crypto crime report shared with The Hacker News. "If this pace continues, ransomware attackers will extort $898.6 million from victims in 2023, trailing only 2021's $939.9 million." In contrast, crypto scams have pulled in 77% less revenue than they did through June of 2022, largely driven by the abrupt exit of&nbsp; VidiLook , which pays users VDL tokens in return for watching digital ads that then can be exchanged for large rewards. So have the inflows to illicit addresses associated with malware, darknet markets, child abuse material, and fraud shops. The development, following a&nbsp; decline

Microsoft on Tuesday&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that it repelled a cyber attack staged by a Chinese nation-state actor targeting two dozen organizations, some of which include government agencies, in a cyber espionage campaign designed to acquire confidential data. The attacks, which commenced on May 15, 2023, entailed access to email accounts affecting approximately 25 entities and a small number of related individual consumer accounts. The tech giant attributed the campaign to Storm-0558, describing it as a nation-state activity group based out of China that primarily singles out government agencies in Western Europe. "They focus on espionage, data theft, and credential access," Microsoft&nbsp; said . "They are also known to use custom malware that Microsoft tracks as Cigril and Bling, for credential access." The breach is said to have been detected a month later on June 16, 2023, after an unidentified customer reported the anomalous email activity to the company. Microsoft sai

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a novel rootkit signed by Microsoft that's engineered to communicate with an actor-controlled attack infrastructure. Trend Micro has attributed the activity cluster to the same actor that was previously identified as behind the&nbsp; FiveSys rootkit , which came to light in October 2021. "This malicious actor originates from China and their main victims are the gaming sector in China," Trend Micro's Mahmoud Zohdy, Sherif Magdy, and Mohamed Fahmy&nbsp; said . Their malware seems to have passed through the Windows Hardware Quality Labs ( WHQL ) process for getting a valid signature. Multiple variants of the rootkit spanning eight different clusters have been discovered, with 75 such drivers signed using Microsoft's WHQL program in 2022 and 2023. Trend Micro's analysis of some of the samples has revealed the presence of debug messages in the source code, indicating that the operation is still in the development and testing phas

"Actors are leveraging multiple open-source tools that alter the signing date of kernel mode drivers to load malicious and unverified drivers signed with expired certificates," Cisco Talos said in an&nbsp; exhaustive two-part report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News. "This is a major threat, as access to the kernel provides complete access to a system, and therefore total compromise." Following responsible disclosure, Microsoft&nbsp; said &nbsp;it has taken steps to block all certificates to mitigate the threat. It further stated that its investigation found "the activity was limited to the abuse of several developer program accounts and that no Microsoft account compromise has been identified." The tech giant, besides suspending developer program accounts involved in the incident, emphasized that the threat a

What is the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework? MITRE ATT&amp;CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a widely adopted framework and knowledge base that outlines and categorizes the&nbsp; tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in cyberattacks . Created by the nonprofit organization MITRE, this framework provides security professionals with insights and context that can help them comprehend, identify, and mitigate cyber threats effectively. The techniques and tactics in the framework are organized in a dynamic matrix. This makes navigation easy and also provides a holistic view of the entire spectrum of adversary behaviors. As a result, the framework is more actionable and usable than if it were a static list. The MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework can be found here:&nbsp; https://attack.mitre.org/ Look Out: MI

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud environments continue to be at the receiving end of an ongoing advanced attack campaign dubbed SCARLETEEL, with the threat actors now setting their sights on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Fargate. "Cloud environments are still their primary target, but the tools and techniques used have adapted to bypass new security measures, along with a more resilient and stealthy command and control architecture," Sysdig security researcher Alessandro Brucato said in a new report shared with The Hacker News. SCARLETEEL was&nbsp; first exposed &nbsp;by the cybersecurity company in February 2023, detailing a sophisticated attack chain that culminated in the theft of proprietary data from AWS infrastructure and the deployment of cryptocurrency miners to profit off the compromised systems' resources illegally. A follow-up analysis by Cado Security&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;potential links to a prolific cryptojacking group known as&nbsp; TeamTNT , although Sysdig told The Hacker News that it "could be some

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A developing piece of ransomware called&nbsp; Big Head &nbsp;is being distributed as part of a malvertising campaign that takes the form of bogus Microsoft Windows updates and Word installers. Big Head was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs last month, when it discovered multiple variants of the ransomware that are designed to encrypt files on victims' machines in exchange for a cryptocurrency payment. "One Big Head ransomware variant displays a fake Windows Update, potentially indicating that the ransomware was also distributed as a fake Windows Update," Fortinet researchers said at the time. "One of the variants has a Microsoft Word icon and was likely distributed as counterfeit software." A majority of the Big Head samples have been submitted so far from the U.S., Spain, France, and Turkey. In a new analysis of the .NET-based ransomware, Trend Micro detailed its inner workings, calling out its ability to deploy three encrypted binaries: 1.exe to propag

Apple has released&nbsp; Rapid Security Response &nbsp;updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Safari web browser to&nbsp; address &nbsp;a zero-day flaw that it said has been actively exploited in the wild. The WebKit bug, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-37450 , could allow threat actors to achieve arbitrary code execution when processing specially crafted web content. The iPhone maker said it addressed the issue with improved checks. Credited with discovering and reporting the flaw is an anonymous researcher. As with most cases like this, there are scant details about the nature and the scale of the attacks and the identity of the threat actor behind them. But Apple noted in a terse advisory that it's "aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited." The updates, iOS 16.5.1 (a), iPadOS 16.5.1 (a), macOS Ventura 13.4.1 (a), and Safari 16.5.2, are available for devices running the following operating system versions: iOS 16.5.1 and iPadOS 16.5.1 macOS Ventura 13.4.1 macOS Big

Businesses operating in the Latin American (LATAM) region are the target of a new Windows-based banking trojan called&nbsp; TOITOIN &nbsp;since May 2023.

Brick-and-mortar retailers and e-commerce sellers may be locked in a fierce battle for market share, but one area both can agree on is the need to secure their SaaS stack. From communications tools to order management and fulfillment systems, much of today's critical retail software lives in SaaS apps in the cloud. Securing those applications is crucial to ongoing operations, chain management, and business continuity.&nbsp; Breaches in retail send out seismic shockwaves. Ten years later, many still remember one national retailer that had 40 million credit card records stolen. Those attacks have continued. According to&nbsp; Verizon's &nbsp;Data Breach Investigations Report, last year saw 629 cybersecurity incidents in the sector. Clearly, retailers must take concrete steps to secure their SaaS stack.&nbsp; And yet, securing applications is complicated. Retailers tend to have multiple tenants of apps, which leads to confusion over which instances of the application were already secured and whic

The threat actors behind the RomCom RAT have been suspected of phishing attacks targeting the&nbsp; upcoming NATO Summit &nbsp;in Vilnius as well as an identified organization supporting Ukraine abroad. The findings come from the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team, which&nbsp; found &nbsp;two malicious documents submitted from a Hungarian IP address on July 4, 2023. RomCom, also tracked under the names Tropical Scorpius, UNC2596, and Void Rabisu, was recently observed staging cyber attacks against politicians in Ukraine who are working closely with Western countries and a U.S.-based healthcare organization involved with aiding refugees fleeing the war-torn country. Attack chains mounted by the group are geopolitically motivated and have employed spear-phishing emails to point victims to cloned websites hosting trojanized versions of popular software. Targets include militaries, food supply chains, and IT companies. The latest lure documents identified by BlackBerry impersonate Ukrainia

Hackers Steal $20 Million by Exploiting Flaw in Revolut's Payment Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/hackers-steal-20-million-by-exploiting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors exploited an unknown flaw in Revolut's payment systems to steal more than $20 million of the company's funds in early 2022. The development was&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by the Financial Times, citing multiple unnamed sources with knowledge of the incident. The breach has not been disclosed publicly. The fault stemmed from discrepancies between Revolut's U.S. and European systems, causing funds to be erroneously refunded using its own money when some transactions were declined. The problem was first detected in late 2021. But before it could be closed, the report said organized criminal groups leveraged the loophole by "encouraging individuals to try to make expensive purchases that would go on to be declined." The refunded amounts would then be withdrawn from ATMs. The exact technical details associated with the flaw are currently unclear. About $23 million was stolen in total, with some funds recovered by pursuing those who had withdrawn cash. The mass

Two file management apps on the Google Play Store have been discovered to be spyware, putting the privacy and security of up to 1.5 million Android users at risk. These apps engage in deceptive behaviour and secretly send sensitive user data to malicious servers in China. Pradeo, a leading mobile security company, has uncovered this alarming infiltration. The report shows that both spyware apps, namely File Recovery and Data Recovery (com.spot.music.filedate) with over 1 million installs, and File Manager (com.file.box.master.gkd) with over 500,000 installs, are developed by the same group. These seemingly harmless Android apps use similar malicious tactics and automatically launch when the device reboots without user input. Contrary to what they claim on the Google Play Store, where both apps assure users that no data is collected, Pradeo's analytics engine has found that various personal information is collected without users' knowledge. Stolen data includes contact list

Vishing Goes High-Tech: New 'Letscall' Malware Employs Voice Traffic Routing<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/vishing-goes-high-tech-new-letscall.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have issued a warning about an emerging and advanced form of voice phishing ( vishing ) known as " Letscall ." This technique is currently targeting individuals in South Korea. The criminals behind "Letscall" employ a multi-step attack to deceive victims into downloading malicious apps from a counterfeit Google Play Store website. Once the malicious software is installed, it redirects incoming calls to a call center under the control of the criminals. Trained operators posing as bank employees then extract sensitive information from unsuspecting victims. To facilitate the routing of voice traffic, "Letscall" utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as voice over IP (VOIP) and WebRTC. It also makes use of Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) and Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) protocols, including Google STUN servers, to ensure high-quality phone or video calls and bypass NAT and firewall restrictions.

Another Critical Unauthenticated SQLi Flaw Discovered in MOVEit Transfer Software<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/another-critical-unauthenticated-sqli.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Progress Software has announced the discovery and patching of a critical SQL injection vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer, popular software used for secure file transfer. In addition, Progress Software has patched two other high-severity vulnerabilities. The identified SQL injection vulnerability, tagged as CVE-2023-36934 , could potentially allow unauthenticated attackers to gain unauthorized access to the MOVEit Transfer database. SQL injection vulnerabilities are a well-known and dangerous security flaw that allows attackers to manipulate databases and run any code they want. Attackers can send specifically designed payloads to certain endpoints of the affected application, which could change or expose sensitive data in the database. The reason CVE-2023-36934 is so critical is that it can be exploited without having to be logged in. This means that even attackers without valid credentials can potentially exploit the vulnerability. However, as of now, there have been no reports of

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mastodon, a popular decentralized social network, has released a security update to fix critical vulnerabilities that could expose millions of users to potential attacks. Mastodon is known for its federated model, consisting of thousands of separate servers called "instances," and it has over 14 million users across more than 20,000 instances. The most critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-36460 , allows hackers to exploit a flaw in the media attachments feature, creating and overwriting files in any location the software could access on an instance. This software vulnerability could be used for DoS and arbitrary remote code execution attacks, posing a significant threat to users and the broader Internet ecosystem. If an attacker gains control over multiple instances, they could cause harm by instructing users to download malicious applications or even bring down the entire Mastodon infrastructure. Fortunately, there is no evidence of this vulnerability being exploited so fa

CISOs, security leaders, and SOC teams often struggle with limited visibility into all connections made to their company-owned assets and networks. They are hindered by a lack of open-source intelligence and powerful technology required for proactive, continuous, and effective discovery and protection of their systems, data, and assets. As advanced threat actors constantly search for easily exploitable vulnerabilities around the clock, CISOs are in pursuit of improved methods to reduce threat exposures and safeguard their assets, users, and data from relentless cyber-attacks and the severe consequences of breaches. In response to this need, an emerging solution addressing the most critical priorities at the initial stage of the attack chain has provided security leaders with a new tool to manage their most pressing threat exposures at their origin. Leading analyst firm Gartner Research describes the solution: "By 2026, organizations prioritizing their security investments based

Ransomware attacks are a major problem for organizations everywhere, and the severity of this problem continues to intensify. Recently, Microsoft's Incident Response team investigated the BlackByte 2.0 ransomware attacks and exposed these cyber strikes' terrifying velocity and damaging nature. The findings indicate that hackers can complete the entire attack process, from gaining initial access to causing significant damage, in just five days. They waste no time infiltrating systems, encrypting important data, and demanding a ransom to release it. This shortened timeline poses a significant challenge for organizations trying to protect themselves against these harmful operations. BlackByte ransomware is used in the final stage of the attack, using an 8-digit number key to encrypt the data. To carry out these attacks, hackers use a powerful combination of tools and techniques.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has released its monthly security updates for the Android operating system, addressing 46 new software vulnerabilities. Among these, three vulnerabilities have been identified as actively exploited in targeted attacks. One of the vulnerabilities tracked as CVE-2023-26083 is a memory leak flaw affecting the Arm Mali GPU driver for Bifrost, Avalon, and Valhall chips. This particular vulnerability was exploited in a previous attack that enabled spyware infiltration on Samsung devices in December 2022. This vulnerability was regarded as serious enough to prompt the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue a patching order for federal agencies in April 2023. Another significant vulnerability, identified as CVE-2021-29256, is a high-severity issue that affects specific versions of the Bifrost and Midgard Arm Mali GPU kernel drivers.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a newly identified security flaw in the Linux kernel that could allow a user to gain elevated privileges on a target host. Dubbed&nbsp; StackRot &nbsp;( CVE-2023-3269 , CVSS score: 7.8), the flaw impacts Linux versions 6.1 through 6.4. There is no evidence that the shortcoming has been exploited in the wild to date. "As StackRot is a Linux kernel vulnerability found in the memory management subsystem, it affects almost all kernel configurations and requires minimal capabilities to trigger," Peking University security researcher Ruihan Li&nbsp; said . "However, it should be noted that maple nodes are freed using RCU callbacks, delaying the actual memory deallocation until after the RCU grace period. Consequently, exploiting this vulnerability is considered challenging." Following&nbsp; responsible disclosure &nbsp;on June 15, 2023, it has been&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;in stable versions 6.1.37, 6.3.11, and 6.4.1 as of July 1, 2023, after a two-week effort led by Linus Tor

As technology advances and organizations become more reliant on data, the risks associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks also increase. The introduction of data privacy laws, such as the GDPR, has made it mandatory for organizations to disclose breaches of personal data to those affected. As such, it has become essential for businesses to protect themselves from the financial and reputational costs of cyber incidents. One solution to help organizations protect themselves is cyber insurance, despite the rising costs of cyber insurance, where the average&nbsp; price in the U.S. rose 79% &nbsp;in the second quarter of 2022. Also, with strict eligibility requirements that have emerged in response to risk and sharp spikes in successful breaches during and post-COVID-19, cyber insurance remains essential for organizations to protect sensitive customer information and their own data from falling into the wrong hands. While cyber insurance is not a one-size-fits-all solution and may not cover

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed an attack infrastructure that's being used as part of a "potentially massive campaign" against cloud-native environments. "This infrastructure is in early stages of testing and deployment, and is mainly consistent of an aggressive cloud worm, designed to deploy on exposed JupyterLab and Docker APIs in order to deploy&nbsp; Tsunami malware , cloud credentials hijack, resource hijack, and further infestation of the worm," cloud security firm Aqua&nbsp; said . The activity, dubbed&nbsp; Silentbob &nbsp;in reference to an AnonDNS domain set up by the attacker, is said to be linked to the infamous cryptojacking group tracked as&nbsp; TeamTNT , citing overlaps in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). However, the involvement of an "advanced copycat" hasn't been ruled out. Aqua's investigation was prompted in the aftermath of an attack targeting its honeypot in early June 2023, leading to the discovery of four malicious cont

A suspected senior member of a French-speaking hacking crew known as OPERA1ER has been arrested as part of an international law enforcement operation codenamed Nervone, Interpol has announced. "The group is believed to have stolen an estimated USD 11 million -- potentially as much as 30 million -- in more than 30 attacks across 15 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America," the agency&nbsp; said . The arrest was made by authorities in Côte d'Ivoire early last month. Additional insight was provided by the U.S. Secret Service's Criminal Investigative Division and Booz Allen Hamilton DarkLabs. The financially motivated collective is also known by the aliases Common Raven, DESKTOP-GROUP, and NX$M$. Its modus operandi was&nbsp; first exposed &nbsp;by Group-IB and Orange CERT Coordination Center (Orange-CERT-CC) in November 2022, detailing its intrusions on banks, financial services, and telecom companies between March 2018 and October 2022.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A sophisticated stealer-as-a-ransomware threat dubbed&nbsp; RedEnergy &nbsp;has been spotted in the wild targeting energy utilities, oil, gas, telecom, and machinery sectors in Brazil and the Philippines through their LinkedIn pages. The malware "possesses the ability to steal information from various browsers, enabling the exfiltration of sensitive data, while also incorporating different modules for carrying out ransomware activities," Zscaler researchers Shatak Jain and Gurkirat Singh&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a recent analysis. The goal, the researchers noted, is to couple data theft with encryption with the goal of inflicting maximum damage to the victims. The starting point for the multi-stage attack is a&nbsp; FakeUpdates &nbsp;(aka SocGholish) campaign that tricks users into downloading JavaScript-based malware under the guise of web browser updates. What makes it novel is the use of reputable LinkedIn pages to target victims, redirecting users clicking on the website URLs to a bogus landing page

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Secrets are meant to be hidden or, at the very least, only known to a specific and limited set of individuals (or systems). Otherwise, they aren't really secrets. In personal life, a secret revealed can damage relationships, lead to social stigma, or, at the very least, be embarrassing. In a developer's or application security engineer's professional life, the consequences of exposing secrets can lead to breaches of security, data leaks, and, well, also be embarrassing. And while there are tools available for detecting source code and code repositories, there are few options for identifying secrets in plain text, documents, emails, chat logs, content management systems, and more. What Are Secrets? In the context of applications, secrets are sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, cryptographic keys, and other confidential data that an application needs to function but should not be exposed to unauthorized users. Secrets are typically stored securely and access

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The npm registry for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment is susceptible to what's called a&nbsp; manifest confusion &nbsp;attack that could potentially allow threat actors to conceal malware in project dependencies or perform arbitrary script execution during installation. "A npm package's manifest is published independently from its tarball," Darcy Clarke, a former GitHub and npm engineering manager,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published last week. "Manifests are never fully validated against the tarball's contents." "The ecosystem has broadly assumed the contents of the manifest and tarball are consistent," Clarke added. The problem, at its core, stems from the fact that the manifest and package metadata are decoupled and that they are never cross-referenced against one another, thereby leading to unexpected behavior and misuse when there is a mismatch. As a result, a threat actor could exploit this loophole to publish a module with a ma

The Swedish data protection watchdog has warned companies against using Google Analytics due to risks posed by U.S. government surveillance, following similar moves by&nbsp; Austria, France , and&nbsp; Italy &nbsp;last year. The development comes in the aftermath of an audit initiated by the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) against four companies CDON, Coop, Dagens Industri, and Tele2. "In its audits, IMY considers that the data transferred to the U.S. via Google's statistics tool is personal data because the data can be linked with other unique data that is transferred," IMY&nbsp; said . "The authority also concludes that the technical security measures that the companies have taken are not sufficient to ensure a level of protection that essentially corresponds to that guaranteed within the EU/EEA." The data protection authority also fined $1.1 million for Swedish telecom service provider Tele2 and less than $30,000 for local online marketplace CDON failing to

The threat actors behind the&nbsp; DDoSia &nbsp;attack tool have come up with a new version that incorporates a new mechanism to retrieve the list of targets to be bombarded with junk HTTP requests in an attempt to bring them down. The updated variant, written in Golang, "implements an additional security mechanism to conceal the list of targets, which is transmitted from the [command-and-control] to the users," cybersecurity company Sekoia&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up. DDoSia is attributed to a pro-Russian hacker group called&nbsp; NoName(057)16 . Launched in 2022 and a successor of the&nbsp; Bobik botnet , the attack tool is&nbsp; designed &nbsp;for staging distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets primarily located in Europe as well as Australia, Canada, and Japan. Lithuania, Ukraine, Poland, Italy, Czechia, Denmark, Latvia, France, the U.K., and Switzerland have emerged as the most targeted countries over a period ranging from May 8 to June 26, 2023.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An e-crime actor of Mexican provenance has been linked to an Android mobile malware campaign targeting financial institutions globally, but with a specific focus on Spanish and Chilean banks, from June 2021 to April 2023. The activity is being attributed to an actor codenamed&nbsp; Neo_Net , according to security researcher Pol Thill. The findings were published by SentinelOne following a Malware Research Challenge in collaboration with vx-underground. "Despite using relatively unsophisticated tools, Neo_Net has achieved a high success rate by tailoring their infrastructure to specific targets, resulting in the theft of over 350,000 EUR from victims' bank accounts and compromising Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of thousands of victims," Thill&nbsp; said . Some of the major targets include banks such as Santander, BBVA, CaixaBank, Deutsche Bank, Crédit Agricole, and ING.

No less than 330,000 FortiGate firewalls are still unpatched and vulnerable to CVE-2023-27997, a critical security flaw affecting Fortinet devices that has come under active exploitation in the wild. Cybersecurity firm Bishop Fox, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;published last week, said that out of nearly 490,000 Fortinet SSL-VPN interfaces exposed on the internet, about 69 percent remain unpatched. CVE-2023-27997 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), also called XORtigate, is a critical vulnerability impacting Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy SSL-VPN appliances that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands via specifically crafted requests.

A Chinese nation-state group has been observed targeting Foreign Affairs ministries and embassies in Europe using&nbsp; HTML smuggling techniques &nbsp;to deliver the PlugX remote access trojan on compromised systems.

"The campaign uses new delivery methods to deploy (most notably – HTML Smuggling) a new variant of PlugX, an implant commonly associated with a wide variety of Chinese threat actors," Check Point&nbsp; said . "Although the payload itself remains similar to the one found in older PlugX variants, its delivery methods result in low detection rates, which until recently helped the campaign fly under the radar." The exact identity of the threat actor behind the operation is a little hazy, although existing clues point in the direction of&nbsp; Mustang Panda , which also shares overlaps with clusters tracked as Earth Preta, RedDelta, and Check Point's own d

BlackCat Operators Distributing Ransomware Disguised as WinSCP via Malvertising<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/blackcat-operators-distributing.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the&nbsp; BlackCat ransomware &nbsp;have been observed employing malvertising tricks to distribute rogue installers of the WinSCP file transfer application. "Malicious actors used malvertising to distribute a piece of malware via cloned webpages of legitimate organizations," Trend Micro researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. "In this case, the distribution involved a webpage of the well-known application WinSCP, an open-source Windows application for file transfer." Malvertising &nbsp; refers &nbsp;to the use of&nbsp; SEO poisoning techniques &nbsp;to spread malware via online advertising. It typically involves hijacking a chosen set of keywords to display bogus ads on Bing and Google search results pages with the goal of redirecting unsuspecting users to sketchy pages. The idea is to trick users searching for applications like WinSCP into downloading malware, in this instance, a backdoor that contains a&nbsp; Cobalt Strike Beacon &nbsp;that connects to a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have pulled back the curtain on an updated version of an Apple macOS malware called RustBucket that comes with improved&nbsp;capabilities to establish persistence and avoid detection by security software. "This variant of RustBucket, a malware family that targets macOS systems, adds persistence capabilities not previously observed," Elastic Security Labs researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week, adding it's "leveraging a dynamic network infrastructure methodology for command-and-control." RustBucket is the work of a North Korean threat actor known as BlueNoroff, which is part of a larger intrusion set tracked under the name&nbsp; Lazarus Group , an elite hacking unit supervised by the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), the country's primary intelligence agency. The malware came to light in April 2023, when Jamf Threat Labs&nbsp; described &nbsp;it as an AppleScript-based backdoor capable of retrieving a second-stage payload from a remote server. Elas

Charming Kitten, the nation-state actor affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has been attributed to a bespoke spear-phishing campaign that delivers an updated version of a fully-featured PowerShell backdoor called POWERSTAR. "There have been improved operational security measures placed in the malware to make it more difficult to analyze and collect intelligence," Volexity researchers Ankur Saini and Charlie Gardner said in a report published this week. The threat actor is something of an expert when it comes to employing social engineering to lure targets, often crafting tailored fake personas on social media platforms and engaging in sustained conversations to build rapport before sending a malicious link. It's also tracked under the names APT35, Cobalt Illusion, Mint Sandstorm (formerly Phosphorus), and Yellow Garuda.

Meta's WhatsApp has rolled out updates to its proxy feature, allowing more flexibility in the kind of content that can be shared in conversations. This includes the ability to send and receive images, voice notes, files, stickers and GIFs, WhatsApp told The Hacker News. The new features were&nbsp; first reported &nbsp;by BBC Persian. Some of the other improvements include streamlined steps to simplify the setup process as well as the introduction of shareable links to "share functioning/valid proxy addresses to their contacts for easy and automatic installation." Support for&nbsp; proxy servers &nbsp;was officially launched by the messaging service&nbsp; earlier this January , thereby helping users circumvent government-imposed censorship and internet shutdowns and obtain indirect access to WhatsApp. The company has also made available a&nbsp; reference implementation &nbsp;for setting up a proxy server with ports 80, 443 or 5222 available and domain name that points to the server's IP address. &amp;

An active financially motivated campaign is targeting vulnerable SSH servers to covertly ensnare them into a proxy network. "This is an active campaign in which the attacker leverages SSH for remote access, running malicious scripts that stealthily enlist victim servers into a peer-to-peer (P2P) proxy network, such as Peer2Profit or Honeygain," Akamai researcher Allen West said in a Thursday report. Unlike cryptojacking, in which a compromised system's resources are used to illicitly mine cryptocurrency, proxyjacking offers the ability for threat actors to leverage the victim's unused bandwidth to covertly run different services as a P2P node. This offers two-fold benefits: It not only enables the attacker to monetize the extra bandwidth with a significantly reduced resource load that would be necessary to carry out cryptojacking, it also reduces the chances of discovery. "It is a stealthier alternative to cryptojacking and has serious implications that ca

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
MITRE has released its annual list of the Top 25 "most dangerous software weaknesses" for the year 2023. "These weaknesses lead to serious vulnerabilities in software," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&nbsp; said . "An attacker can often exploit these vulnerabilities to take control of an affected system, steal data, or prevent applications from working." The&nbsp; list &nbsp;is based on an&nbsp; analysis &nbsp;of public vulnerability data in the National Vulnerability Data ( NVD ) for root cause mappings to CWE weaknesses for the previous two years. A total of 43,996 CVE entries were examined and a score was attached to each of them based on prevalence and severity. Coming out top is Out-of-bounds Write, followed by Cross-site Scripting, SQL Injection, Use After Free, OS Command Injection, Improper Input Validation, Out-of-bounds Read, Path Traversal, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian state-sponsored group dubbed MuddyWater has been attributed to a previously unseen command-and-control (C2) framework called&nbsp; PhonyC2 &nbsp;that's been put to use by the actor since 2021. Evidence shows that the custom made, actively developed framework has been leveraged in the&nbsp; February 2023 attack on Technion , an Israeli research institute, cybersecurity firm Deep Instinct said in a report shared with The Hacker News. What's more, additional links have been unearthed between the Python 3-based program and other attacks carried out by MuddyWater, including the&nbsp; ongoing exploitation of PaperCut servers . "It is structurally and functionally similar to&nbsp; MuddyC3 , a previous MuddyWater&nbsp; custom C2 framework &nbsp;that was written in Python 2," security researcher Simon Kenin said. "MuddyWater is continuously updating the PhonyC2 framework and changing TTPs to avoid detection." MuddyWater, also known as Mango Sandstorm (previously Mercury), is a cyber

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have shared the inner workings of an Android malware family called&nbsp; Fluhorse . The malware "represents a significant shift as it incorporates the malicious components directly within the Flutter code," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Axelle Apvrille&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. Fluhorse was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Check Point in early May 2023, detailing its attacks on users located in East Asia through rogue apps masquerading as ETC and VPBank Neo, which are popular in Taiwan and Vietnam. The initial intrusion vector for the malware is phishing. The ultimate goal of the app is to steal credentials, credit card details, and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes received as SMS to a remote server under the control of the threat actors. The latest findings from Fortinet, which reverse-engineered a&nbsp; Fluhorse sample &nbsp;uploaded to VirusTotal on June 11, 2023, suggest that the malware has evolved, incorporating additional sophistication b

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cyber threat intelligence is an effective weapon in the ongoing battle to protect digital assets and infrastructure - especially when combined with AI. But AI is only as good as the data feeding it. Access to unique, underground sources is key. Threat Intelligence offers tremendous value to people and companies. At the same time, its ability to address organizations' cybersecurity needs and the benefits it offers vary by company, industry, and other factors. A common challenge with cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is that the data it produces can be vast and overwhelming, creating confusion and inefficiencies among security teams' threat exposure management efforts. Additionally, organizations have different levels of security maturity, which can make access to and understanding of CTI data difficult. Enter generative AI. Many cybersecurity companies – and more specifically, threat intelligence companies – are bringing generative AI to market to simplify threat intelligence a

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical security flaw has been disclosed in miniOrange's&nbsp; Social Login and Register plugin &nbsp;for WordPress that could enable a malicious actor to log in as any user-provided information about email address is already known. Tracked as CVE-2023-2982 (CVSS score: 9.8), the authentication bypass flaw impacts all versions of the plugin, including and prior to 7.6.4. It was addressed on June 14, 2023, with the release of version 7.6.5 following responsible disclosure on June 2, 2023. "The vulnerability makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to any account on a site including accounts used to administer the site, if the attacker knows, or can find, the associated email address," Wordfence researcher István Márton&nbsp; said . The issue is rooted in the fact that the encryption key used to secure the information during login using social media accounts is hard-coded, thus leading to a scenario where attackers could create a valid request with a properl

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Windows-based information stealer called&nbsp; ThirdEye &nbsp;has been discovered in the wild with capabilities to harvest sensitive data from infected hosts. Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, which&nbsp; made the discovery , said it found the malware in an executable that masqueraded as a&nbsp; PDF file &nbsp;with a Russian name "CMK Правила оформления больничных листов.pdf.exe," which translates to "CMK Rules for issuing sick leaves.pdf.exe." The arrival vector for the malware is presently unknown, although the nature of the lure points to it being used in a phishing campaign. The very&nbsp; first ThirdEye sample &nbsp;was uploaded to VirusTotal on April 4, 2023, with relatively fewer features. The evolving stealer, like&nbsp; other malware families &nbsp;of its kind, is equipped to gather system metadata, including BIOS release date and vendor, total/free disk space on the C drive, currently running processes, register usernames, and volume information.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Drones that don't have any known security weaknesses could be the target of electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) attacks, potentially enabling a threat actor to achieve arbitrary code execution and compromise their functionality and safety. The research comes from IOActive, which&nbsp; found &nbsp;that it is "feasible to compromise the targeted device by injecting a specific EM glitch at the right time during a firmware update." "This would allow an attacker to gain code execution on the main processor, gaining access to the Android OS that implements the core functionality of the drone," Gabriel Gonzalez, director of hardware security at the company, said in a report published this month. The&nbsp; study , which was undertaken to determine the current security posture of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), was carried out on&nbsp; Mavic Pro , a popular quadcopter drone manufactured by DJI that employs various security features like signed and encrypted firmware, Trusted Executi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have exposed the workings of a scam ring called CryptosLabs that's estimated to have made €480 million in illegal profits by targeting users in French-speaking individuals in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg since April 2018. The syndicate's massive fake investment schemes primarily involve impersonating 40 well-known banks, fin-techs, asset management firms, and crypto platforms, setting up a scam infrastructure spanning over 350 domains hosted on more than 80 servers, Group-IB&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep-dive report. The Singapore-headquartered company described the criminal outfit as "operated by a hierarchy of kingpins, sales agents, developers, and call center operators" who are recruited to ensnare potential victims by promising high returns on their capital. "CryptoLabs made their scam schemes more convincing through region-focused tactics, such as hiring French-speaking callers as 'managers' and creating fake landing pages, socia

5 Things CISOs Need to Know About Securing OT Environments<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/5-things-cisos-need-to-know-about.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For too long the cybersecurity world focused exclusively on information technology (IT), leaving operational technology (OT) to fend for itself. Traditionally, few industrial enterprises had dedicated cybersecurity leaders. Any security decisions that arose fell to the plant and factory managers, who are highly skilled technical experts in other areas but often lack cybersecurity training or knowledge. In more recent years, an uptick in cyberattacks against industrial facilities and the trend of IT/OT convergence driven by Industry 4.0 have highlighted the vacuum of ownership around OT security.&nbsp; According to a new Fortinet report , most organizations are looking to Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) to solve the problem. Fortunately, CISOs are no strangers to change or difficult challenges. The position itself is less than 20 years old, yet in those two decades CISOs have navigated some of the most disruptive cybersecurity events that were truly watershed moments in techno

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A ransomware threat called 8Base that has been operating under the radar for over a year has been attributed to a "massive spike in activity" in May and June 2023. "The group utilizes encryption paired with 'name-and-shame' techniques to compel their victims to pay their ransoms," VMware Carbon Black researchers Deborah Snyder and Fae Carlisle&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "8Base has an opportunistic pattern of compromise with recent victims spanning across varied industries." 8Base, according to statistics gathered by&nbsp; Malwarebytes &nbsp;and&nbsp; NCC Group , has been linked to 67 attacks as of May 2023, with about 50% of the victims&nbsp; operating &nbsp;in the business services, manufacturing, and construction sectors. A majority of the targeted companies are located in the U.S. and Brazil. With very little known about the operators of the ransomware, its origins remain something of a cipher.

Soko is a Go software module that powers&nbsp; packages.gentoo.org , offering users an easy way to search through different Portage packages that are available for Gentoo Linux distribution.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new process injection technique dubbed Mockingjay could be exploited by threat actors to bypass security solutions to execute malicious code on compromised systems. "The injection is executed without space allocation, setting permissions or even starting a thread," Security Joes researchers Thiago Peixoto, Felipe Duarte, and Ido Naor&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The uniqueness of this technique is that it requires a vulnerable DLL and copying code to the right section." Process injection is an&nbsp; attack method &nbsp;that allows adversaries to inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses and elevate privileges. In doing so, it could allow for the execution of arbitrary code in the memory space of a separate live process. Some of the well-known process injection techniques include dynamic link library (DLL) injection, portable executable injection, thread execution hijacking, process hollowing, and process doppelgänging, amon

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new ongoing campaign aimed at the npm&nbsp;ecosystem that leverages a unique execution chain to deliver an unknown payload to targeted systems. "The packages in question seem to be published in pairs, each pair working in unison to fetch additional resources which are subsequently decoded and/or executed," software supply chain security firm Phylum&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report released last week. To that end, the order in which the pair of packages are installed is paramount to pulling off a successful attack, as the first of the two modules are designed to store locally a token retrieved from a remote server. The campaign was first discovered on June 11, 2023. The second package subsequently passes this token as a parameter alongside the operating system type to an&nbsp; HTTP GET request &nbsp;to acquire a second script from the remote server. A successful execution returns a Base64-encoded string that is immediately executed but only if that string is

Beyond Asset Discovery: How Attack Surface Management Prioritizes Vulnerability Remediation<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/beyond-asset-discovery-how-attack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the business environment becomes increasingly connected, organizations' attack surfaces continue to expand, making it challenging to map and secure both known and unknown assets. In particular, unknown assets present security challenges related to shadow IT, misconfigurations, ineffective scan coverage, among others. Given attack surface sprawl and evolving threats, many organizations are embracing&nbsp; attack surface management (ASM) &nbsp;tools to discover and address critical exposures. Asset discovery is an important capability to have, and one that's helping to drive the adoption of attack surface management tools and services. That said, asset discovery is only one aspect of effective attack surface management. Making the attack surface as impenetrable as possible takes offensive security that goes far beyond the discovery phase. Why Asset Discovery Isn't Enough&nbsp; Given the complexity and ever-expanding scale of the digital infrastructure at most companies, cataloging all the known

A new Android malware campaign has been observed pushing the Anatsa banking trojan to target banking customers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria, and Switzerland since the start of March 2023.

The Dutch cybersecurity company said Anatsa-infected Google Play Store&nbsp; dropper apps &nbsp;have accrued over 30,000 installations to date, indicating that the official app storefront has become an effective distribution vector for the malware. Anatsa, also known by the name TeaBot and Toddler, first&nbsp; emerged &nbsp;in&nbsp; early 2021 , and has been observed&nbsp; masquerading &nbsp;as&nbsp; seemingly innocuous utility apps &nbsp;like PDF readers, QR code scanners, and two-factor authentication (2FA) apps on Google Play to siphon users' credentials.

Researchers Find Way to Recover Cryptographic Keys by Analyzing LED Flickers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/researchers-find-way-to-recover.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's an ingenious&nbsp; side-channel attack , a group of academics has found that it's possible to recover secret keys from a device by analyzing video footage of its power LED. "Cryptographic computations performed by the CPU change the power consumption of the device which affects the brightness of the device's power LED," researchers from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Cornell University&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a study. By taking advantage of this observation, it's possible for threat actors to leverage video camera devices such as an iPhone 13 or an internet-connected surveillance camera to extract the cryptographic keys from a smart card reader­. Specifically, video-based cryptanalysis is accomplished by obtaining video footage of rapid changes in an LED's brightness and exploiting the video camera's&nbsp; rolling shutter &nbsp;effect to capture the physical emanations. "This is caused by the fact that the power LED is connected directly to the pow

Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Falls Victim to JokerSpy macOS Backdoor Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/japanese-cryptocurrency-exchange-falls.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown cryptocurrency exchange located in Japan was the target of a new attack earlier this month to deploy an Apple macOS backdoor called JokerSpy. Elastic Security Labs, which is monitoring the intrusion set under the name&nbsp; REF9134 ,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the attack led to the installation of Swiftbelt, a Swift-based enumeration tool inspired by an open-source utility called&nbsp; SeatBelt . JokerSky was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Bitdefender last week, describing it as a sophisticated toolkit designed to breach macOS machines. Very little is known about the threat actor behind the operation other than the fact that the attacks leverage a set of programs written in Python and Swift that come with capabilities to gather data and execute arbitrary commands on compromised hosts. A primary component of the toolkit is a self-signed multi-architecture binary known as xcc that's engineered to check for FullDiskAccess and ScreenRecording permissions. The file is signed as XProtectCheck, indicating an

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security and IT teams are routinely forced to adopt software before fully understanding the security risks. And AI tools are no exception. Employees and business leaders alike are flocking to generative AI software and similar programs, often unaware of the major SaaS security vulnerabilities they're introducing into the enterprise. A February 2023&nbsp; generative AI survey of 1,000 executives &nbsp;revealed that 49% of respondents use ChatGPT now, and 30% plan to tap into the ubiquitous generative AI tool soon. Ninety-nine percent of those using ChatGPT claimed some form of cost-savings, and 25% attested to reducing expenses by $75,000 or more. As the researchers conducted this survey a mere three months after ChatGPT's general availability, today's ChatGPT and AI tool usage is undoubtedly higher.&nbsp; Security and risk teams are already overwhelmed protecting their SaaS estate (which has now become the operating system of business) from common vulnerabilities such as misconfigurati

Microsoft has disclosed that it's detected a spike in credential-stealing attacks conducted by the Russian state-affiliated hacker group known as Midnight Blizzard. The intrusions, which made use of residential proxy services to obfuscate the source IP address of the attacks, target governments, IT service providers, NGOs, defense, and critical manufacturing sectors, the tech giant's threat intelligence team said. Midnight Blizzard, formerly known as Nobelium , is also tracked under the monikers APT29, Cozy Bear, Iron Hemlock, and The Dukes. The&nbsp; group , which drew worldwide attention for the SolarWinds supply chain compromise in December 2020, has&nbsp; continued &nbsp;to rely on&nbsp; unseen tooling &nbsp;in its targeted attacks aimed at foreign ministries and diplomatic entities. It's a sign of how determined they are to keep their operations up and running despite being exposed, which makes them a particularly formidable actor in the espionage area.

The newly discovered Chinese nation-state actor known as Volt Typhoon has been observed to be active in the wild since at least mid-2020, with the hacking crew linked to never-before-seen tradecraft to retain remote access to targets of interest.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has&nbsp; added &nbsp;a batch of six flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. This comprises three vulnerabilities that Apple patched this week ( CVE-2023-32434, CVE-2023-32435, and CVE-2023-32439 ), two flaws in VMware ( CVE-2023-20867 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-20887 ), and one shortcoming impacting Zyxel devices ( CVE-2023-27992 ). CVE-2023-32434 and CVE-2023-32435, both of which allow code execution, are said to have been exploited as zero-days to deploy spyware as part of a years-long cyber espionage campaign that commenced in 2019. Dubbed Operation Triangulation, the activity culminates in the deployment of&nbsp; TriangleDB &nbsp;that's designed to harvest a wide range of information from compromised devices, such as creating, modifying, removing, and stealing files, listing and terminating processes, gathering credentials from iCloud Keychain, and tracking a user's location.

The infamous Twitter breach allowed the defendant and his co-conspirators to obtain unauthorized access to backend tools used by Twitter, abusing them to hijack 130 popular accounts to perpetrate a crypto scam that netted them about $120,000 in illegal profits. "In other instances, the co-conspirators sold access to Twitter accounts to others," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)&nbsp; said .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor known as&nbsp; Muddled Libra &nbsp;is targeting the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry with persistent attacks that leverage advanced social engineering ploys to gain initial access. "The attack style defining Muddled Libra appeared on the cybersecurity radar in late 2022 with the release of the 0ktapus phishing kit, which offered a prebuilt hosting framework and bundled templates," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. Libra is the&nbsp; designation &nbsp;given by the cybersecurity company for cybercrime groups. The "muddled" moniker for the threat actor stems from the prevailing ambiguity with regards to the use of the 0ktapus framework. 0ktapus , also known as Scatter Swine, refers to an intrusion set that first came to light in August 2022 in connection with smishing attacks against over 100 organizations, including Twilio and Cloudflare.

The case for browser fingerprinting: personalizing user experience, improving fraud detection, and optimizing login security Have you ever heard of browser fingerprinting? You should! It's an online user identification technique that collects information about a visitor's web browser and its configuration preferences to associate individual browsing sessions with a single website visitor.&nbsp; With browser fingerprinting, many pieces of data can be collected about a user's web browser and device, such as screen resolution, location, language, and operating system. When you stitch these pieces together, they reveal a unique combination of information that forms every user's visitor ID or "digital fingerprint." Websites can use the visitor ID in various ways, including personalizing the user's experience, improving fraud detection, and optimizing login security.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new strain of JavaScript dropper has been observed delivering next-stage payloads like Bumblebee and IcedID. Cybersecurity firm Deep Instinct is tracking the malware as&nbsp; PindOS , which contains the name in its " User-Agent " string. Both&nbsp; Bumblebee &nbsp;and IcedID serve as loaders, acting as a vector for other malware on compromised hosts, including ransomware. A recent report from Proofpoint&nbsp; highlighted &nbsp;IcedID's abandoning of banking fraud features to solely focus on malware delivery. Bumblebee , notably, is a replacement for another loader called&nbsp; BazarLoader , which has been attributed to the now-defunct TrickBot and Conti groups. A report from Secureworks in April 2022&nbsp; found &nbsp;evidence of collaboration between several actors in the Russian cybercrime ecosystem, including that of&nbsp; Conti ,&nbsp; Emotet , and IcedID.

NSA Releases Guide to Combat Powerful BlackLotus Bootkit Targeting Windows Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/nsa-releases-guide-to-combat-powerful.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) on Thursday released guidance to help organizations detect and prevent infections of a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) bootkit called&nbsp; BlackLotus . To that end, the agency is&nbsp; recommending &nbsp;that "infrastructure owners take action by hardening user executable policies and monitoring the integrity of the boot partition." BlackLotus is an&nbsp; advanced &nbsp;crimeware solution that was first spotlighted in October 2022 by Kaspersky. A UEFI bootkit capable of bypassing Windows Secure Boot protections, samples of the malware have since emerged in the wild. This is accomplished by taking advantage of a known Windows flaw called Baton Drop ( CVE-2022-21894 , CVSS score: 4.4) discovered in vulnerable&nbsp; boot loaders &nbsp;not added into the&nbsp; Secure Boot DBX revocation list . The vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft in January 2022. This loophole could be exploited by threat actors to replace fully patched boot loaders with vulnerable v

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Internet-facing Linux systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being targeted as part of a new campaign designed to illicitly mine cryptocurrency. "The threat actors behind the attack use a backdoor that deploys a wide array of tools and components such as rootkits and an IRC bot to steal device resources for mining operations," Microsoft threat intelligence researcher Rotem Sde-Or&nbsp; said . "The backdoor also installs a patched version of OpenSSH on affected devices, allowing threat actors to hijack SSH credentials, move laterally within the network, and conceal malicious SSH connections." To pull off the scheme, misconfigured Linux hosts are brute-forced to gain initial access, following which the threat actors move to disable shell history and fetch a trojanized version of OpenSSH from a remote server. The rogue OpenSSH package is configured to install and launch the backdoor, a shell script that allows the attackers to distribute additional payloads a

A new phishing campaign codenamed&nbsp; MULTI#STORM &nbsp;has set its sights on India and the U.S. by leveraging JavaScript files to deliver remote access trojans on compromised systems. "The attack chain ends with the victim machine infected with multiple unique RAT (remote access trojan) malware instances, such as Warzone RAT and Quasar RAT," Securonix researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov&nbsp; said . "Both are used for command-and-control during different stages of the infection chain." The multi-stage attack chain commences when an email recipient clicks the embedded link pointing to a password-protected ZIP file ("REQUEST.zip") hosted on Microsoft OneDrive with the password "12345." Extracting the archive file reveals a heavily obfuscated JavaScript file ("REQUEST.js") that, when double clicked, activates the infection by executing two PowerShell commands that are responsible for retrieving two separate payloads from OneDri

The cybersecurity company, which found evidence of USB malware infections in Myanmar, South Korea, Great Britain, India, and Russia, said the findings are the result of a cyber incident that it investigated at an unnamed European hospital in early 2023. The probe found that the entity was not directly targeted by the adversary but rather suffered a breach via an employee's USB drive, which became infected when it was plugged into a colleague's computer at a conference in Asia.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Why Data Exfiltration Detection is Paramount? The world is witnessing an exponential rise in ransomware and data theft employed to extort companies. At the same time, the industry faces numerous critical vulnerabilities in database software and company websites. This evolution paints a dire picture of data exposure and exfiltration that every security leader and team is grappling with. This article highlights this challenge and expounds on the benefits that Machine Learning algorithms and Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) approaches bring to the table. Data exfiltration often serves as the final act of a cyberattack, making it the last window of opportunity to detect the breach before the data is made public or is used for other sinister activities, such as espionage. However, data leakage isn't only an aftermath of cyberattacks, it can also be a consequence of human error. While prevention of data exfiltration through security controls is ideal, the escalating complexity a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical security flaw has been disclosed in the WordPress "Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce" plugin that's&nbsp; installed &nbsp;on more than 30,000 websites. "This vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker to gain access to the accounts of users who have abandoned their carts, who are typically customers but can extend to other high-level users when the right conditions are met," Defiant's Wordfence&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. Tracked as CVE-2023-2986, the shortcoming has been rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS scoring system. It impacts all versions of the plugin, including and prior to versions 5.14.2. The problem, at its core, is a case of authentication bypass that arises as a result of insufficient encryption protections that are applied when customers are notified when they have abandoned their shopping carts on e-commerce sites without completing the purchase. Specifically, the encryption key is hard-coded in the plugin, thereby allowing

The North Korean threat actor known as ScarCruft has been observed using an information-stealing malware with previous undocumented wiretapping features as well as a backdoor developed using Golang that exploits the Ably real-time messaging service. "The threat actor sent their commands through the Golang backdoor that is using the Ably service," the AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC) said in a technical report. "The API key value required for command communication was saved in a GitHub repository." ScarCruft is a state-sponsored outfit with links to North Korea's Ministry of State Security (MSS). It's known to be active since at least 2012. Attack chains mounted by the group entail the use of spear-phishing lures to deliver RokRAT , although it has leveraged a wide range of other custom tools to harvest sensitive information.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More details have emerged about the spyware implant that's delivered to iOS devices as part of a campaign called Operation Triangulation. Kaspersky, which&nbsp; discovered the operation &nbsp;after becoming one of the targets at the start of the year, said the malware has a lifespan of 30 days, after which it gets automatically uninstalled unless the time period is extended by the attackers. The Russian cybersecurity company has codenamed the backdoor&nbsp; TriangleDB . "The implant is deployed after the attackers obtain root privileges on the target iOS device by exploiting a kernel vulnerability," Kaspersky researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today. "It is deployed in memory, meaning that all traces of the implant are lost when the device gets rebooted. Therefore, if the victim reboots their device, the attackers have to reinfect it by sending an iMessage with a malicious attachment, thus launching the whole exploitation chain again."

A security shortcoming in Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) Open Authorization ( OAuth ) process could have been exploited to achieve full account takeover, researchers said. California-based identity and access management service Descope, which discovered and reported the issue in April 2023, dubbed it&nbsp; nOAuth . "nOAuth is an authentication implementation flaw that can affect Microsoft Azure AD multi-tenant OAuth applications," Omer Cohen, chief security officer at Descope,&nbsp; said . The misconfiguration has to do with how a malicious actor can modify email attributes under "Contact Information" in the Azure AD account and exploit the "Log in with Microsoft" feature to hijack a victim account. To pull off the attack, all an adversary has to do is to create and access an Azure AD admin account and modify their email address to that of a victim and take advantage of the single sign-on scheme on a vulnerable app or website.

Foreign affairs ministries in the Americas have been targeted by a Chinese state-sponsored actor named&nbsp; Flea &nbsp;as part of a recent campaign that spanned from late 2022 to early 2023. The cyber attacks, per Broadcom's Symantec, involved a new backdoor codenamed Graphican.

"Flea used a large number of tools in this campaign," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News, describing the threat actor as "large and well-resourced." "As well as the new Graphican backdoor, the attackers leveraged a variety of living-off-the-land tools, as well as tools that have been previously linked to Flea."

New Condi Malware Hijacking TP-Link Wi-Fi Routers for DDoS Botnet Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-condi-malware-hijacking-tp-link-wi.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware called&nbsp; Condi &nbsp;has been observed exploiting a security vulnerability in TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800) Wi-Fi routers to rope the devices into a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet. Fortinet FortiGuard Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;the campaign has ramped up since the end of May 2023. Condi is the work of a threat actor who goes by the online alias zxcr9999 on Telegram and runs a Telegram channel called Condi Network to advertise their warez. "The Telegram channel was started in May 2022, and the threat actor has been monetizing its botnet by providing DDoS-as-a-service and selling the malware source code," security researchers Joie Salvio and Roy Tay said. An analysis of the malware artifact reveals its ability to terminate other competing botnets on the same host. It, however, lacks a persistence mechanism, meaning the program cannot survive a system reboot. To get around this limitation, the malware deletes multiple binaries that are used to shut down or reboot the

Three security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in operational technology (OT) products from Wago and Schneider Electric. The flaws, per Forescout, are part of a&nbsp; broader &nbsp; set &nbsp;of&nbsp; shortcomings &nbsp;collectively called&nbsp; OT:ICEFALL , which now comprises a total of 61 issues spanning 13 different vendors. "OT:ICEFALL demonstrates the need for tighter scrutiny of, and improvements to, processes related to secure design, patching and testing in OT device vendors," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The most severe of the flaws is&nbsp; CVE-2022-46680 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), which concerns the plaintext transmission of credentials in the ION/TCP protocol used by power meters from Schneider Electric. Successful exploitation of the bug could enable threat actors to gain control of vulnerable devices. It's worth noting that CVE-2022-46680 is one among the 56 flaws&nbsp; originally unearthed &nbsp;by Forescout in June 2022. The other two new security holes ( CVE-2023

The Quick Serve Restaurant (QSR) industry is built on consistency and shared resources. National chains like McDonald's and regional ones like Cracker Barrel grow faster by reusing the same business model, decor, and menu, with little change from one location to the next.&nbsp; QSR technology stacks mirror the consistency of the front end of each store. Despite each franchise being independently owned and operated, they share subscriptions to SaaS applications, or use multiple tenants of the same application. Each app is typically segmented by store. Corporate IT and Security has access to the entire database, while each franchise has visibility into its own data.&nbsp; These SaaS apps cover everything from CRMs to supply chains to marketing and HR. The data within is used to understand consumer habits, improve marketing campaigns, and manage employees.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A highly targeted cyber attack against an East Asian IT company involved the deployment of a custom malware written in Golang called&nbsp; RDStealer . "The operation was active for more than a year with the end goal of compromising credentials and data exfiltration," Bitdefender security researcher Victor Vrabie&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. Evidence gathered by the Romanian cybersecurity firm shows that the campaign started in early 2022. The target was an unspecified IT company located in East Asia. In the early phases, the operation relied on readily available remote access trojans like AsyncRAT and Cobalt Strike, before transitioning to bespoke malware in late 2021 or early 2022 in a bid to thwart detection. A primary evasion tactic concerns the use of Microsoft Windows folders that are likely to be excluded from scanning by security software (e.g., System32 and Program Files) to store the backdoor payloads.

Individuals in the Pakistan region have been targeted using two rogue Android apps available on the Google Play Store as part of a new targeted campaign. Cybersecurity firm Cyfirma attributed the campaign with moderate confidence to a threat actor known as&nbsp; DoNot Team , which is also tracked as APT-C-35 and Viceroy Tiger. The espionage activity involves duping Android smartphone owners into downloading a program that's used to extract contact and location data from unwitting victims. "The motive behind the attack is to gather information via the stager payload and use the gathered information for the second-stage attack, using malware with more destructive features," the company&nbsp; said . DoNot Team &nbsp;is a suspected India-nexus threat actor that has a reputation for carrying out attacks against various countries in South Asia. It has been active since at least 2016.

New Mystic Stealer Malware Targets 40 Web Browsers and 70 Browser Extensions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-mystic-stealer-malware-targets-40.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new information-stealing malware called&nbsp; Mystic Stealer &nbsp;has been found to steal data from about 40 different web browsers and over 70 web browser extensions. First advertised on April 25, 2023, for $150 per month, the malware also targets cryptocurrency wallets, Steam, and Telegram, and employs extensive mechanisms to resist analysis. "The code is heavily obfuscated making use of polymorphic string obfuscation, hash-based import resolution, and runtime calculation of constants,"&nbsp; InQuest &nbsp;and&nbsp; Zscaler &nbsp;researchers said in an analysis published last week. Mystic Stealer, like many other crimeware solutions that are offered for sale, focuses on pilfering data and is implemented in the C programming language. The control panel has been developed using Python. Updates to the malware in May 2023 incorporate a loader component that allows it to retrieve and execute next-stage payloads fetched from a command-and-control (C2) server, making it a more formidable threat.

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a set of malicious artifacts that they say is part of a sophisticated toolkit targeting Apple macOS systems. "As of now, these samples are still largely undetected and very little information is available about any of them," Bitdefender researchers Andrei Lapusneanu and Bogdan Botezatu&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a preliminary report published on Friday. The Romanian firm's analysis is based on an examination of four samples that were uploaded to VirusTotal by an unnamed victim. The earliest sample dates back to April 18, 2023. Two of the three malicious programs are said to be generic Python-based backdoors that are designed to target Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. The payloads have been collectively dubbed&nbsp; JokerSpy . The first constituent is shared.dat, which, once launched, runs an operating system check (0 for Windows, 1 for macOS, and 2 for Linux) and establishes contact with a remote server to fetch additional instructions for execut

Microsoft on Friday attributed a string of service outages aimed at Azure, Outlook, and OneDrive earlier this month to an uncategorized cluster it tracks under the name&nbsp; Storm-1359 . "These attacks likely rely on access to multiple virtual private servers (VPS) in conjunction with rented cloud infrastructure, open proxies, and DDoS tools," the tech giant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post on Friday. Storm-#### (previously DEV-####) is a temporary designation the Windows maker assigns to unknown, emerging, or developing groups whose identity or affiliation hasn't been definitively established yet. While there is no evidence that any customer data was accessed or compromised, the company noted the attacks "temporarily impacted availability" of some services. Redmond said it further observed the threat actor launching&nbsp; layer 7 DDoS attacks &nbsp;from multiple cloud services and open proxy infrastructures.

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered previously undocumented payloads associated with a Romanian threat actor named&nbsp; Diicot , revealing its potential for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

Diicot (née Mexals) was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Bitdefender in July 2021, uncovering the actor's use of a Go-based SSH brute-forcer tool called Diicot Brute to breach Linux hosts as part of a cryptojacking campaign. Then earlier this April, Akamai&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;what it described as a "resurgence" of the 2021 activity that's believed to have started around October 2022, netting the actor about $10,000 in illicit profits.

The threat actor known as&nbsp; ChamelGang &nbsp;has been observed using a previously undocumented implant to backdoor Linux systems, marking a new expansion of the threat actor's capabilities. The malware, dubbed&nbsp; ChamelDoH &nbsp;by Stairwell, is a C++-based tool for communicating via DNS-over-HTTPS ( DoH ) tunneling. ChamelGang was&nbsp; first outed &nbsp;by Russian cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies in September 2021, detailing its attacks on fuel, energy, and aviation production industries in Russia, the U.S., India, Nepal, Taiwan, and Japan. Attack chains mounted by the actor have leveraged vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application to gain initial access and carry out data theft attacks using a passive backdoor called DoorMe. "This is a native&nbsp; IIS module &nbsp;that is registered as a filter through which HTTP requests and responses are processed," Positive Technologies said at the time.

As Threat Actors Continuously Adapt their TTPs in Today's Threat Landscape, So Must You Earlier this year, threat researchers at Cybersixgill released the annual report,&nbsp; The State of the Cybercrime Underground . &nbsp;The research stems from an analysis of Cybersixgill's collected intelligence items throughout 2022, gathered from the deep, dark and clear web. The report examines the continuous evolution of threat actors' tactics, tools, and procedures (TTPs) in the Digital Age – and how organizations can adapt to reduce risk and maintain business resilience. This article summarizes a few of the report's findings, including trends in credit card fraud, observations about cryptocurrency, AI developments and how they're lowering barriers to entry to cybercrime, and the rise of cybercriminal "as-a-service" activities. Further below, I also discuss the need for a new security approach, combining attack surface management (ASM) and cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Thursday unveiled charges against a Russian national for his alleged involvement in deploying LockBit ransomware to targets in the U.S., Asia, Europe, and Africa. Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov, 20, of Chechen Republic has been accused of perpetrating at least five attacks between August 2020 and March 2023. He was arrested in the state of Arizona last month. "Astamirov allegedly participated in a conspiracy with other members of the LockBit ransomware campaign to commit wire fraud and to intentionally damage protected computers and make ransom demands through the use and deployment of ransomware," the DoJ&nbsp; said . Astamirov, as part of his LockBit-related activities, managed various email addresses, IP addresses, and other online accounts to deploy the ransomware and communicate with the victims. Law enforcement agencies said they were able to trace a chunk of an unnamed victim's ransom payment to a virtual currency address operated by Astam

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Progress Software on Thursday&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a third vulnerability impacting its MOVEit Transfer application, as the Cl0p cybercrime gang deployed extortion tactics against affected companies. The&nbsp; new flaw , which is being tracked as CVE-2023-35708 , also concerns an SQL injection vulnerability that "could lead to escalated privileges and potential unauthorized access to the environment." The company is urging its customers to disable all HTTP and HTTPs traffic to MOVEit Transfer on ports 80 and 443 to safeguard their environments while a fix is being prepared to address the weakness. The cloud managed file transfer solution has been fully patched. The revelation comes a week after Progress&nbsp; divulged &nbsp;another set of SQL injection vulnerabilities ( CVE-2023-35036 ) that it said could be weaponized to access the application's database content. The vulnerabilities join&nbsp; CVE-2023-34362 , which was&nbsp; exploited &nbsp;as a zero-day by the Clop ransomware gang in data theft attacks

Ask any security professional and they'll tell you that remediating risks from various siloed security scanning tools requires a tedious and labor-intensive series of steps focused on deduplication, prioritization, and routing of issues to an appropriate "fixer" somewhere in the organization. This burden on already resource-strapped security teams is an efficiency killer.&nbsp; A new study , commissioned by Seemplicity and conducted by Dark Reading, provides fresh insight into how security pros handle the challenging remediation life cycle from discovery to resolution. The research reveals the obstacles security professionals face when coordinating remediation activities. The data exposes the outcomes — in increased workload and diminished risk posture — that arise from lengthy remediation times, inefficient and uncontrolled manual processes, the lack of managerial visibility and oversight across the risk life cycle.&nbsp; Remediation Process Broken Down to Steps and Time Spent on Each Step

Cyber attacks on e-commerce applications are a common trend in 2023 as e-commerce businesses become more omnichannel, they build and deploy increasingly more API interfaces, with threat actors constantly exploring more ways to exploit vulnerabilities. This is why regular testing and ongoing monitoring are necessary to fully protect web applications, identifying weaknesses so they can be mitigated quickly. In this article, we will discuss the recent Honda e-commerce platform attack, how it happened, and its impact on the business and its clients. In addition, to the importance of application security testing, we will also discuss the different areas of vulnerability testing and its various phases. Finally, we will provide details on how a long-term preventative solution such as&nbsp; PTaaS &nbsp;can protect e-commerce businesses and the differences between continuous testing (PTaaS) and standard pen testing.

Public Wi-Fi, which has long since become the norm, poses threats to not only individual users but also businesses. With the rise of remote work, people can now work from virtually anywhere: a cafe close to home, a hotel in a different city, or even while waiting for a plane at the airport. Next, let's explore the risks of connecting to public Wi-Fi, both for you personally and for businesses. According to the&nbsp; Forbes Advisor &nbsp;the majority of people (56%) connect to public Wi-Fi networks that don't require a password. This convenience comes at a price, and many are unaware that attackers can steal card details, passwords, and other sensitive information. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: &nbsp;This is one of the most common threats on public Wi-Fi. In an MITM attack, the hacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties.

What's the State of Credential theft in 2023?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/whats-state-of-credential-theft-in-2023.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
At a little overt halfway through 2023, credential theft is still a major thorn in the side of IT teams. The heart of the problem is the value of data to cybercriminals and the evolution of the techniques they use to get hold of it. The&nbsp; 2023 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) &nbsp;revealed that 83% of breaches involved external actors, with almost all attacks being financially motivated. Of these breaches by external actors, 49% involved the use of stolen credentials.&nbsp; We'll explore why credential theft is still such an attractive (and successful) attack route, and look at how IT security teams can fight back in the second half of 2023 and beyond. Users are still often the weak link The hallmarks of many successful cyberattacks are the determination, inventiveness, and patience threat actors show. Though a user may spot some attacks through security and awareness training, it only takes one well-crafted attack to catch them. Sometimes all it takes is for a user to be

A new study conducted by Uptycs has uncovered a stark increase in the distribution of information stealing (a.k.a. infostealer or stealer) malware. Incidents have more than doubled in Q1 2023, indicating an alarming trend that threatens global organizations. According to the new Uptycs' whitepaper,&nbsp; Stealers are Organization Killers , a variety of new info stealers have emerged this year, preying on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. Telegram has notably been used extensively by these malware authors for command, control, and data exfiltration. What is a Stealer? A stealer is a type of malware that targets its victim by stealing sensitive information that can include passwords, login credentials, and other personal data. After collecting such data, the stealer sends it to the threat actor's command and control (C2) system. RedLine and Vidar, two well-known stealers, took advantage of log-providing services to infiltrate private systems. RedLine primarily targets credenti

As the number of people using macOS keeps going up, so does the desire of hackers to take advantage of flaws in Apple's operating system.&nbsp; What Are the Rising Threats to macOS? There is a common misconception among macOS fans that Apple devices are immune to hacking and malware infection. However, users have been facing more and more dangers recently. Inventive attackers are specifically targeting Mac systems, as seen with the "Geacon" Cobalt Strike tool attack. This tool enables them to perform malicious actions such as data theft, privilege elevation, and remote device control, placing the security and privacy of Mac users at grave risk. Earlier this year, researchers also uncovered the MacStealer malware, which also stole sensitive data from Apple users. Documents, iCloud keychain data, browser cookies, credit card credentials – nothing is safe from the prying eyes.&nbsp; But that's not all.

If it seems like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) has been around forever, it's because it has (at least compared to the many technologies that rise and fall within just a few years.) The initial version, known as "Remote Desktop Protocol 4.0," was released in 1996 as part of the Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server edition and allowed users to remotely access and control Windows-based computers over a network connection.&nbsp; In the intervening decades, RDP has become a widely used protocol for remote access and administration of Windows-based systems. RDP plays a crucial role in enabling remote work, IT support, and system management and has served as the foundation for various remote desktop and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solutions.&nbsp; The downside of RDP's widespread use is that a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in an RDP gateway can have severe consequences, potentially leading to significant damage and compromising the security and integrity of the affec

Cyber attacks using infected USB infection drives as an initial access vector have witnessed a three-fold increase in the first half of 2023,&nbsp; That's according to new findings from Mandiant, which detailed two such campaigns – SOGU and SNOWYDRIVE – targeting both public and private sector entities across the world. SOGU is the "most prevalent USB-based cyber espionage attack using USB flash drives and one of the most aggressive cyber espionage campaigns targeting both public and private sector organizations globally across industry verticals," the Google-owned threat intelligence firm&nbsp; said . The activity has been attributed to a China-based cluster called TEMP.Hex, which is also tracked under the names Camaro Dragon, Earth Preta, and Mustang Panda. Targets include construction and engineering, business services, government, health, transportation, and retail in Europe, Asia, and the U.S. The infection chain detailed by Mandiant exhibits tactical commonalities with

Ransomware has emerged as the only cryptocurrency-based crime to grow in 2023, with cybercriminals extorting nearly $175.8 million more than they did a year ago, according to findings from Chainalysis. "Ransomware attackers are on pace for their second-biggest year ever, having extorted at least $449.1 million through June," the blockchain analytics firm&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a midyear crypto crime report shared with The Hacker News. "If this pace continues, ransomware attackers will extort $898.6 million from victims in 2023, trailing only 2021's $939.9 million." In contrast, crypto scams have pulled in 77% less revenue than they did through June of 2022, largely driven by the abrupt exit of&nbsp; VidiLook , which pays users VDL tokens in return for watching digital ads that then can be exchanged for large rewards.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Brick-and-mortar retailers and e-commerce sellers may be locked in a fierce battle for market share, but one area both can agree on is the need to secure their SaaS stack. From communications tools to order management and fulfillment systems, much of today's critical retail software lives in SaaS apps in the cloud. Securing those applications is crucial to ongoing operations, chain management, and business continuity.&nbsp; Breaches in retail send out seismic shockwaves. Ten years later, many still remember one national retailer that had 40 million credit card records stolen. Those attacks have continued. According to&nbsp; Verizon's &nbsp;Data Breach Investigations Report, last year saw 629 cybersecurity incidents in the sector. Clearly, retailers must take concrete steps to secure their SaaS stack.&nbsp; And yet, securing applications is complicated. Retailers tend to have multiple tenants of apps, which leads to confusion over which instances of the application were already secured and whic

The supply chain vulnerability, also known as dependency repository hijacking, is a&nbsp; class of attacks &nbsp;that makes it possible to take over&nbsp;retired organization or user names and publish trojanized versions of repositories to run malicious code. "When a repository owner changes their username, a link is created between the old name and the new name for anyone who downloads dependencies from the old repository," researchers Ilay Goldman and Yakir Kadkoda said. "However, it is possible for anyone to create the old username and break this link."

The revolutionary technology of GenAI tools, such as ChatGPT, has brought significant risks to organizations' sensitive data. But what do we really know about this risk? A&nbsp; new research &nbsp;by Browser Security company LayerX sheds light on the scope and nature of these risks. The report titled "Revealing the True GenAI Data Exposure Risk" provides crucial insights for data protection stakeholders and empowers them to take proactive measures.

Over Half of Security Leaders Lack Confidence in Protecting App Secrets, Study Reveals<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/over-half-of-security-leaders-lack.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
It might come as a surprise, but secrets management has become the elephant in the AppSec room. While security vulnerabilities like Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) often make headlines in the cybersecurity world, secrets management remains an overlooked issue that can have immediate and impactful consequences for corporate safety.&nbsp; A recent study by GitGuardian found that 75% of IT decision-makers in the US and the UK reported at least one secret leaked from an application, with 60% causing issues for the company or employees. Shockingly, less than half of respondents (48%) were confident in their ability to protect application secrets "to a great extent." The study, named&nbsp; Voice of Practitioners: The State of Secrets in AppSec &nbsp;(available for free download&nbsp; here ), provides a fresh perspective on managing secrets, which is often reduced to clichés that do not reflect the operational reality in engineering departments.&nbsp; Despite their ubiquity in modern cloud a

Why Now? The Rise of Attack Surface Management<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/why-now-rise-of-attack-surface.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The term " attack surface management "&nbsp;(ASM) went from unknown to ubiquitous in the cybersecurity space over the past few years. Gartner and Forrester have both highlighted the&nbsp; importance of ASM &nbsp;recently, multiple solution providers have emerged in the space, and investment and acquisition activity have seen an uptick. Many concepts come and go in cybersecurity, but attack surface management promises to have staying power. As it evolves into a critical component of threat and exposure management strategies, it's worth examining why attack surface management has grown to become a key category, and why it will continue to be a necessity for organizations worldwide. What is Attack Surface Management?&nbsp; Attack surfaces are rapidly expanding. The attack surface includes any IT asset connected to the internet – applications, IoT devices, Kubernetes clusters, cloud platforms – that threat actors could infiltrate and exploit to perpetuate an attack.

The way we work has undergone a dramatic transformation in recent years. We now operate within digital ecosystems, where remote work and the reliance on a multitude of digital tools is the norm rather than the exception. This shift – as you likely know from your own life – has led to superhuman levels of productivity that we wouldn't ever want to give up. But moving fast comes at a cost. And for our digital work environment, that cost is security.&nbsp; Our desire for innovation, speed and efficiency has birthed new and complex security challenges that all in some way or another revolve around securing how we access resources. Because of this, effective access management now plays a more critical role in securing the modern workplace than ever. Follow along as we uncover five reasons why this is the case. Educating People About Security is Not Working For years, we've held the belief that educating people about cyberthreats would make them more cautious online. Yet, despite 17 y

Searching for AI Tools? Watch Out for Rogue Sites Distributing RedLine Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/searching-for-ai-tools-watch-out-for.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious Google Search ads for generative AI services like OpenAI ChatGPT and Midjourney are being used to direct users to sketchy websites as part of a BATLOADER campaign designed to deliver&nbsp; RedLine Stealer &nbsp;malware. "Both AI services are extremely popular but lack first-party standalone apps (i.e., users interface with ChatGPT via their web interface while Midjourney uses Discord)," eSentire said in an analysis. "This vacuum has been exploited by threat actors looking to drive AI app-seekers to imposter web pages promoting fake apps." BATLOADER is a loader malware that's propagated via drive-by downloads where users searching for certain keywords on search engines are displayed bogus ads that, when clicked, redirect them to rogue landing pages hosting malware. The installer file, per eSentire, is rigged with an executable file (ChatGPT.exe or midjourney.exe) and a PowerShell script (Chat.ps1 or Chat-Ready.ps1) that downloads and loads RedLine Stealer

Apple Thwarts $2 Billion in App Store Fraud, Rejects 1.7 Million App Submissions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/apple-thwarts-2-billion-in-app-store.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple has announced that it prevented over $2 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions and rejected roughly 1.7 million app submissions for privacy and security violations in 2022. The computing giant said it terminated 428,000 developer accounts for potential fraudulent activity, blocked 105,000 fake developer account creations, and deactivated 282 million bogus customer accounts. It further noted that it thwarted 198 million attempted fraudulent new accounts prior to their creation. In contrast, Apple is estimated to have booted out 802,000 developer accounts in 2021. The company attributed the decline to new App Store "methods and protocols" that prevent the creation of such accounts in the first place. "In 2022, Apple protected users from nearly 57,000 untrustworthy apps from illegitimate storefronts," the company&nbsp; emphasized .

Why High Tech Companies Struggle with SaaS Security<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/why-high-tech-companies-struggle-with.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
It's easy to think high-tech companies have a security advantage over other older, more mature industries. Most are unburdened by 40 years of legacy systems and software. They draw some of the world's youngest, brightest digital natives to their ranks, all of whom consider cybersecurity issues their entire lives. Perhaps it is due to their familiarity with technology that causes them to overlook SaaS security configurations. During the last Christmas holiday season, Slack had some private code stolen from its GitHub repository. According to Slack, the stolen code didn't impact production, and no customer data was taken. Still, the breach should serve as a warning sign to other tech companies. Stolen tokens allowed threat actors to access the GitHub instance and download the code. If this type of attack can happen to Slack on GitHub, it can happen to any high-tech company. Tech companies must take SaaS security seriously to prevent resources from leaking or being stolen.

In today's interconnected world, where organisations regularly exchange sensitive information with customers, partners and employees, secure collaboration has become increasingly vital. However, collaboration can pose a security risk if not managed properly. To ensure that collaboration remains secure, organisations need to take steps to protect their data. Since collaborating is essential for almost any team to succeed, shouldn't you be able to do it securely?

Lack of Visibility: The Challenge of Protecting Websites from Third-Party Scripts<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/lack-of-visibility-challenge-of.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Third-party apps such as Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, HotJar, and JQuery have become critical tools for businesses to optimize their website performance and services for a global audience. However, as their importance has grown, so has the threat of cyber incidents involving unmanaged third-party apps and open-source tools. Online businesses increasingly struggle to maintain complete visibility and control over the ever-changing third-party threat landscape, with sophisticated threats like evasive skimmers, Magecart attacks, and unlawful tracking practices potentially causing severe damage. This article explores the challenges of protecting modern websites from third-party scripts and the security risks associated with a lack of visibility over these scripts. Invisible to Standard Security Controls&nbsp; Third-party scripts are often invisible to standard security controls like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) because they are loaded from external sources that are not under the control

IT and cybersecurity teams are so inundated with security notifications and alerts within their own systems, it's difficult to monitor external malicious environments – which only makes them that much more threatening.&nbsp; In March, a high-profile data breach hit national headlines when personally identifiable information connected to hundreds of lawmakers and staff was leaked on the dark web. The cybersecurity incident involved the DC Health Link, an online marketplace that administers health plans for members of Congress and Capitol Hill staff. According to news reports, the FBI had successfully purchased a portion of the data – which included social security numbers and other sensitive information – on the dark web.&nbsp; Because of the prominence of the victims, the story was picked up by a slew of media outlets that rarely cover dark web-related cybersecurity crimes. The story not only shed light on one of the most dangerous aspects of the internet, it reminded us that the dark web con

Meta Uncovers Massive Social Media Cyber Espionage Operations Across South Asia<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/meta-uncovers-massive-social-media.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Three different threat actors leveraged hundreds of elaborate fictitious personas on Facebook and Instagram to target individuals located in South Asia as part of disparate attacks. "Each of these APTs relied heavily on social engineering to trick people into clicking on malicious links, downloading malware or sharing personal information across the internet," Guy Rosen, chief information security officer at Meta,&nbsp; said . "This investment in social engineering meant that these threat actors did not have to invest as much on the malware side." The fake accounts, in addition to using traditional lures like women looking for a romantic connection, masqueraded as recruiters, journalists, or military personnel. At least two of the&nbsp; cyber espionage efforts &nbsp;entailed the use of low-sophistication malware with reduced capabilities, likely in an attempt to get past&nbsp; app verification checks &nbsp;established by Apple and Google.&nbsp; One of the groups that came under Meta's r

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The telecom industry has always been a tantalizing target for cybercriminals. The combination of interconnected networks, customer data, and sensitive information allows cybercriminals to inflict maximum damage through minimal effort. It's the breaches in telecom companies that tend to have a seismic impact and far-reaching implications — in addition to reputational damage, which can be difficult to measure, telecoms are often at the receiving end of government fines for their cybersecurity and privacy failures. There are few industries in the world that collect as much sensitive data as telecom companies. In recent years, telecom companies have accelerated their digital transformation, shedding legacy systems and reducing costs. These changes, coupled with the need for stronger collaboration with third-party vendors, have led them to SaaS applications to handle their CRM. Today, telecoms are using SaaS apps for billing, HR, call management, field operations management, tracking ca

Attention Online Shoppers: Don't Be Fooled by Their Sleek, Modern Looks — It's Magecart!<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/attention-online-shoppers-dont-be.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing&nbsp; Magecart &nbsp;campaign has attracted the attention of cybersecurity researchers for leveraging realistic-looking fake payment screens to capture sensitive data entered by unsuspecting users. "The threat actor used original logos from the compromised store and customized a web element known as a modal to perfectly hijack the checkout page," Jérôme Segura, director of threat intelligence at Malwarebytes,&nbsp; said . "The remarkable thing here is that the skimmer looks more authentic than the original payment page." The term&nbsp; Magecart &nbsp;is a catch-all that refers to several cybercrime groups which employ online skimming techniques to steal personal data from websites – most commonly, customer details and payment information on e-commerce websites. The name originates from the groups' initial targeting of the Magento platform. According to&nbsp; data &nbsp;shared by Sansec, the first Magecart-like attacks were observed as early as 2010. As of 2022, more than 70,000 sto

Study: 84% of Companies Use Breached SaaS Applications - Here's How to Fix it for Free!<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/study-84-of-companies-use-breached-saas.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recent review by Wing Security, a SaaS security company that analyzed the data of over 500 companies,&nbsp; revealed some worrisome information . According to this review, 84% of the companies had employees using an average of 3.5 SaaS applications that were breached in the previous 3 months. While this is concerning, it isn't much of a surprise. The exponential growth in SaaS usage has security and IT teams struggling to keep up with which SaaS applications are being used and how. This isn't to say that SaaS should be avoided or blocked; on the contrary, SaaS applications must be used to ensure business growth. But using them has to be done with some level of caution. Determining which SaaS applications are risky The most intuitive risk factor to determining whether an application is risky is looking it up and seeing if it has been breached. SaaS applications are clearly a target as we see more and more SaaS related attacks. A breach is a clear indication to stay away, at leas

Recent data breaches across CircleCI, LastPass, and Okta underscore a common theme: The enterprise SaaS stacks connected to these industry-leading apps can be at serious risk for compromise. CircleCI, for example, plays an integral, SaaS-to-SaaS role for SaaS app development. Similarly, tens of thousands of organizations rely on Okta and LastPass security roles for SaaS identity and access management. Enterprise and niche SaaS apps alike have effectively introduced multitudes of unmonitored endpoints into organizations of all sizes.&nbsp; While&nbsp; spending for SaaS security &nbsp;is trending up, it lags behind categories such as cloud infrastructure protection and network security. According to Statista, the average organization employs 100+ SaaS apps, many of which are unsanctioned by IT, creating a glaring gap in SaaS security.&nbsp; Why Users Flock to SaaS Apps — And Often Bypass IT in the Process As productivity tools for tasks such as marketing automation, document signature, and sales foreca

OpenAI, the company behind the massively popular ChatGPT AI chatbot, has launched a&nbsp; bug bounty program &nbsp;in an attempt to ensure its systems are "safe and secure." To that end, it has partnered with the crowdsourced security platform&nbsp; Bugcrowd &nbsp;for independent researchers to report vulnerabilities discovered in its product in exchange for rewards ranging from "$200 for low-severity findings to up to $20,000 for exceptional discoveries." It's worth noting that the program does not cover&nbsp; model safety or hallucination issues , wherein the chatbot is prompted to generate malicious code or other faulty outputs. The company noted that "addressing these issues often involves substantial research and a broader approach." Other prohibited categories are denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, brute-forcing OpenAI APIs, and demonstrations that aim to destroy data or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information beyond what's necessary to highlight the prob

Here's a hard question to answer: 'How many service accounts do you have in your environment?'. A harder one is: 'Do you know what these accounts are doing?'. And the hardest is probably: 'If any of your service account was compromised and used to access resources would you be able to detect and stop that in real-time?'.&nbsp; Since most identity and security teams would provide a negative reply, it's no wonder that&nbsp; one of the immediate actions today's attackers are doing following an initial endpoint compromised is hunting down unwatched service accounts. &nbsp;And it's even less of a wonder that in most cases, they would succeed in finding one and leveraging it to spread within the entire environment, getting noticed only when it's too late – after workstations and server got encrypted by ransomware or sensitive data was stolen.&nbsp; In this article, we unfold the reasons that have caused service accounts to become one of the most dangerous weaknesse

Are Source Code Leaks the New Threat Software vendors Should Care About?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/are-source-code-leaks-new-threat.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Less than a month ago, Twitter indirectly acknowledged that some of its source code had been leaked on the code-sharing platform GitHub by sending a copyright infringement notice to take down the incriminated repository. The latter is now inaccessible, but according to the media, it was accessible to the public for several months. A user going by the name FreeSpeechEnthousiast committed thousands of documents belonging to the social media platform over several months.&nbsp; While there is no concrete evidence to support this hypothesis, the timing of the leak and the ironic username used by the perpetrator suggest that the leak was a deliberate act aimed at causing harm to the company. Although it is still too early to measure the impact of this leak on the health of Twitter, this incident should be an opportunity for all software vendors to ask a simple question:&nbsp; what if this happened to us? Protecting sensitive information in the software industry is becoming increasingly critical as

Google Mandates Android Apps to Offer Easy Account Deletion In-App and Online<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/google-mandates-android-apps-to-offer.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google is enacting a new data deletion policy for Android apps that allow account creation to also offer users with a setting to delete their accounts in an attempt to provide more transparency and control over their data. "For apps that enable app account creation, developers will soon need to provide an option to initiate account and data deletion from within the app and online," Bethel Otuteye, senior director of product management for Android App Safety,&nbsp; said . "This web requirement, which you will link in your&nbsp; Data safety form , is especially important so that a user can request account and data deletion without having to reinstall an app." The goal, the search behemoth said, is to have a "readily discoverable option" to initiate an app account deletion process from both within an app and outside of it. To that end, developers are to provide users with an in-app path as well as a web link resource to request app account deletion and associated

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Clouded vision CTI systems are confronted with some major issues ranging from the size of the collection networks to their diversity, which ultimately influence the degree of confidence they can put on their signals. Are they fresh enough and sufficiently reliable to avoid any false positives or any poisoning? Do I risk acting on outdated data? This difference is major since a piece of information is just a decision helper, whereas a piece of actionable information can directly be weaponized against an aggressor. If raw data are the hayfields, information is the haystacks, and needles are the actionable signal. To illustrate the collection networks' size &amp; variety point, without naming anyone in particular, let's imagine a large CDN provider. Your role is to deliver, on a massive scale, content over HTTP(s). This attracts a lot of "attention" and signals, but only on the HTTP layer.

Think Before You Share the Link: SaaS in the Real World<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/think-before-you-share-link-saas-in.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Collaboration sits at the essence of SaaS applications. The word, or some form of it, appears in the top two headlines on Google Workspace's homepage. It can be found six times on Microsoft 365's homepage, three times on Box, and once on Workday. Visit nearly any SaaS site, and odds are 'collaboration' will appear as part of the app's key selling point.&nbsp; By sitting on the cloud, content within the applications is immediately shareable, making it easier than ever to work with others.&nbsp; However, that shareability is a two-sided coin. On the flip side are often sensitive links sitting on public-facing websites that can be easily accessed. The exposure caused by leaked documents can cause tremendous harm, from competitors trying to gather corporate secrets to whistleblowers sharing internal information with reporters or legislators. As integral as collaboration is to SaaS, sharing links creates a high-risk situation, and real-life breaches, that can be mitigated through the right process

"It's The Service Accounts, Stupid": Why Do PAM Deployments Take (almost) Forever To Complete?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/its-service-accounts-stupid-why-do-pam.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions are regarded as the common practice to prevent identity threats to administrative accounts. In theory, the PAM concept makes absolute sense: place admin credentials in a vault, rotate their passwords, and closely monitor their sessions. However, the harsh reality is that the vast majority of PAM projects either become a years-long project, or even come to a halt altogether, preventing them from delivering their promised security value. In this article, we explore what makes&nbsp; service accounts a key obstacle in PAM onboarding . We'll learn why vaulting and password rotation of service accounts are an almost impossible task, resulting in leaving them exposed to compromise. We'll then conclude with introducing how Silverfort enables identity teams, for the first time, to overcome these challenges with automated discovery, monitoring, and protection of service accounts, and streamline PAM onboarding process in mere weeks.

Where SSO Falls Short in Protecting SaaS<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/where-sso-falls-short-in-protecting-saas.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication method that allows users to authenticate their identity for multiple applications with just one set of credentials. From a security standpoint, SSO is the gold standard. It ensures access without forcing users to remember multiple passwords and can be further secured with MFA. Furthermore, an estimated 61% of attacks stem from stolen credentials. By removing usernames and passwords, the attack surface is reduced as well. SSO helps companies meet strict compliance regulations by not only enabling businesses to secure their accounts, but by helping them demonstrate that they've taken the necessary steps to meet regulatory requirements. While SSO is an important step in securing SaaS apps and their data, having just SSOs in place to secure the SaaS stack in its entirety is not enough. SSO alone won't prevent a threat actor from accessing a SaaS app. It also won't protect SaaS apps that are onboarded without the IT team's knowledg

Cloud-based repository hosting service GitHub said it took the step of replacing its RSA SSH host key used to secure Git operations "out of an abundance of caution" after it was briefly exposed in a public repository. The activity, which was carried out at 05:00 UTC on March 24, 2023, is said to have been undertaken as a measure to prevent any bad actor from impersonating the service or eavesdropping on users' operations over SSH. "This key does not grant access to GitHub's infrastructure or customer data," Mike Hanley, chief security officer and SVP of engineering at GitHub,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post. "This change only impacts Git operations over SSH using RSA." The move does not impact Web traffic to GitHub.com and Git operations performed via HTTPS. No change is required for ECDSA or Ed25519 users. The Microsoft-owned company said there is no evidence that the exposed SSH private key was exploited by adversaries.

In 2022 alone, global cyberattacks increased by 38%, resulting in substantial business loss, including financial and reputational damage. Meanwhile, corporate security budgets have risen significantly because of the growing sophistication of attacks and the number of cybersecurity solutions introduced into the market. With this rise in threats, budgets, and solutions, how prepared are industries and countries to effectively address today's cyber risk?&nbsp; CYE's new&nbsp; Cybersecurity Maturity Report 2023 &nbsp;tackles this question by shedding light on the strength of cybersecurity in different sectors, company sizes, and countries. It highlights which industries and countries have the most robust cyber postures and which are lagging, as well as the most prevalent vulnerabilities in today's cyber threat landscape. The analysis is based on two years' worth of data, collected from over 500 organizations in 15 countries, and spanning 11 industries and a range of company sizes. It measures cybersec

H0lyGh0st, Magecart, and a slew of state-sponsored hacker groups are diversifying their tactics and shifting their focus to… You. That is, if you're in charge of cybersecurity for a small-to-midsize enterprise (SME). Why? Bad actors know that SMEs typically have a smaller security budget, less infosec manpower, and possibly weak or missing security controls to protect their data and infrastructure. So, how can you prepare for the imminent onslaught from new and emerging threat groups?&nbsp; You need a plan. Start with the NIST Cyber Security Framework The good news is you don't have to create your security strategy from scratch.

As many as 55 zero-day vulnerabilities were exploited in the wild in 2022, with most of the flaws discovered in software from Microsoft, Google, and Apple. While this figure represents a decrease from the year before, when a staggering 81 zero-days were weaponized, it still represents a significant uptick in recent years of threat actors leveraging unknown security flaws to their advantage. The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;come from threat intelligence firm Mandiant, which noted that desktop operating systems (19), web browsers (11), IT and network management products (10), and mobile operating systems (six) accounted for the most exploited product types. Of the 55 zero-day bugs, 13 are estimated to have been abused by cyber espionage groups, with four others exploited by financially motivated threat actors for ransomware-related operations. Commercial spyware vendors were linked to the exploitation of three zero-days. Among state-sponsored groups, those attributed to China have emerged as the most

In last year's edition of the&nbsp; Security Navigator &nbsp;we noted that the Manufacturing Industry appeared to be totally over-represented in our dataset of Cyber Extortion victims. Neither the number of businesses nor their average revenue particularly stood out to explain this. Manufacturing was also the most represented Industry in our CyberSOC dataset – contributing more Incidents than any other sector.&nbsp; We found this trend confirmed in 2023 – so much in fact that we decided to take a closer look. So let's examine some possible explanations.&nbsp; And debunk them. Hunting for possible explanations Manufacturing is still the most impacted industry in our Cyber Extortion dataset in 2023, as tracked by monitoring double-extortion leak sites. Indeed, this sector now represents more than 20% of all victims since we started observing the leak sites in the beginning of 2020. Approximately 28% of all our clients are from Manufacturing, contributing with an overall share of 31% of all p

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) has long ago become a standard security practice. With a wide consensus on its ability to fend off more than 99% percent of account takeover attacks, it's no wonder why security architects regard it as a must-have in their environments. However, what seems to be less known are the inherent coverage limitations of traditional MFA solutions. While compatible with RDP connection and local desktop logins,&nbsp; they offer no protection to remote command line access tools like PsExec, Remote PowerShell and their likes. In practice, it means that workstations and servers remain as vulnerable to lateral movement, ransomware spread and other identity threats despite having a fully functioning MFA solution on. For the adversary it's just a matter of taking the command line path instead of the RDP to log in as if there was not protection installed at all. In this article we'll explore this blind spot, understand its root cause and implications, and view

Phishing, the theft of users' credentials or sensitive data using social engineering, has been a significant threat since the early days of the internet – and continues to plague organizations today,&nbsp; accounting for more than 30% of all known breaches . And with the mass migration to remote working during the pandemic, hackers have ramped up their efforts to steal login credentials as they take advantage of the chaos and lack of in-person user verification.&nbsp; This has led to the revival of the old-school technique of vishing, which, like phishing online, involves using social engineering over the phone to steal sensitive information. Vishing attacks have&nbsp; been on the rise &nbsp;as a result, with 69% of companies experiencing them in 2021, up from 54% in 2020. These attacks often take the form of job or tech support scams and can be incredibly convincing.

Security and IT Teams No Longer Need To Pay For SaaS-Shadow IT Discovery<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/security-and-it-teams-no-longer-need-to.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
This past January, a SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) company named Wing Security (Wing) made waves with the &nbsp;launch of its free SaaS-Shadow IT discovery solution . Cloud-based companies were invited to gain insight into their employees' SaaS usage through a completely free, self-service product that operates on a "freemium" model. If a user is impressed with the solution and wants to gain more insights or take remediation action, they can purchase the enterprise solution. "In today's economic reality, security budgets have not necessarily been cut down, but buyers are far more careful in their purchasing decisions and rightfully so. We believe that you cannot secure what you do not know, so knowing should be a basic commodity. Once you understand the magnitude of your SaaS attack layer, you can make an educated decision as to how you are going to solve it. Discovery is the natural and basic first step and it should be accessible to anyone." said Ga

Employee well-being has become a primary focus for many businesses. Even before the pandemic, the C-suite was acutely aware of how employee mental health impacts business outcomes.&nbsp; But for cybersecurity professionals, stress has always been a part of the job. A&nbsp; new survey &nbsp;revealed that one of the most concerning aspects of employee mental health is how it impacts cybersecurity programs and, more broadly, a business' ability to protect itself from cyberattacks. CISOs and their teams appear to be taking the brunt of unmitigated work-related stress levels and it's affecting the entire organization.&nbsp; CISOs at small to midsize businesses with teams of five employees or fewer were surveyed to better understand how work-related stress is impacting CISOs – from their ability to do their job and lead their team to how it's affecting their own professional outlook and personal life. Here's what the survey results revealed.&nbsp; The Impact of CISO Work-Stress Levels on Small

Spoiler Alert: Organizations with 10,000 SaaS users that use M365 and Google Workspace average over 4,371 additional connected apps. SaaS-to-SaaS (third-party) app installations are growing&nbsp; nonstop &nbsp;at organizations around the world. When an employee needs an additional app to increase their efficiency or productivity, they rarely think twice before installing. Most employees don't even realize that this SaaS-to-SaaS connectivity, which requires scopes like the ability to read, update, create, and delete content, increases their organization's attack surface in a significant way. Third-party app connections typically take place outside the view of the security team, are not vetted to understand the level of risk they pose. Adaptive Shield's latest report,&nbsp; Uncovering the Risks &amp; Realities of Third-Party Connected Apps , dives into the data on this topic.

An investigation into data safety labels for Android apps available on the Google Play Store has uncovered "serious loopholes" that allow apps to provide misleading or outright false information. The&nbsp; study , conducted by the Mozilla Foundation as part of its&nbsp; *Privacy Not Included &nbsp;initiative, compared the privacy policies and labels of the 20 most popular paid apps and the 20 most popular free apps on the app marketplace. It&nbsp; found &nbsp;that, in roughly 80% of the apps reviewed, "the labels were false or misleading based on discrepancies between the apps' privacy policies and the information apps self-reported on Google's&nbsp; Data safety form ." "The apps aren't self-reporting accurately enough to give the public any meaningful reassurance about the safety and privacy of their data," Mozilla further said, adding consumers are being led to "believe these apps are doing a better job protecting their privacy than they are."

The (Other) Risk in Finance A few years ago, a Washington-based real estate developer received a document link from First American – a financial services company in the real estate industry – relating to a deal he was working on. Everything about the document was perfectly fine and normal. The odd part, he&nbsp; told &nbsp;a reporter, was that if he changed a single digit in the URL, suddenly, he could see somebody else's document. Change it again, a different document. With no technical tools or expertise, the developer could retrieve FirstAm records dating back to 2003 – 885&nbsp; million&nbsp; in total, many containing the kinds of sensitive data disclosed in real estate dealings, like bank details, social security numbers, and of course, names and addresses. That nearly a billion records could leak from so simple a web vulnerability seemed shocking. Yet even more severe consequences befall financial services companies every week.

More than 500 hosts have been newly compromised en masse by the ESXiArgs ransomware strain, most of which are located in France, Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K., and Ukraine. The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;come from attack surface management firm Censys, which&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;"two hosts with strikingly similar ransom notes dating back to mid-October 2022, just after ESXi versions 6.5 and 6.7 reached end of life." The first set of infections dates back to October 12, 2022, much earlier than when the campaign&nbsp; began to gain traction &nbsp;at the start of February 2023. Then on January 31, 2023, the ransom notes on the two hosts are said to have been updated with a revised version that matches the ones used in the current wave. Some of the crucial differences between the two ransom notes include the use of an onion URL instead of a Tox chat ID, a Proton Mail address at the bottom of the note, and a lower ransom demand (1.05 Bitcoin vs. 2.09 Bitcoin).

Honeypot-Factory: The Use of Deception in ICS/OT Environments<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/honeypot-factory-use-of-deception-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
There have been a number of reports of attacks on industrial control systems (ICS) in the past few years. Looking a bit closer, most of the attacks seem to have spilt over from traditional IT. That's to be expected, as production systems are commonly connected to ordinary corporate networks at this point.&nbsp; Though our data does not indicate at this point that a lot of threat actors specifically target industrial systems – in fact, most evidence points to purely opportunistic behaviour – the tide could turn any time, once the added complexity of compromising OT environments promises to pay off. Criminals will take any chance they get to blackmail victims into extortion schemes, and halting production can cause immense damage. It is likely only a matter of time. So cybersecurity for operational technology (OT) is vitally important.&nbsp; Deception is an effective option to improve threat detection and response capabilities. However, ICS security differs from traditional IT security in se

A single ransomware attack on a New Zealand managed service provider (MSP) disrupted several of its clients' business operations overnight, most belonging to the healthcare sector. According to the country's privacy commissioner, " a cyber security incident involving a ransomware attack " in late November upended the daily operations of New Zealand's health ministry when it prevented the staff from accessing thousands of medical records. The Ministry of Justice, six health regulatory authorities, a health insurer, and a handful of other businesses also number among those affected by second-hand damage from the attack. There are ways to&nbsp; recover from a ransomware attack , but the damage often extends into that attacked organization's customers and vendors.&nbsp; The targeted MSP in this incident is Mercury IT, a business based in Australia. Te Whatu Ora, the New Zealand health ministry, was unable to access at least 14,000 medical records because of the outage at

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
With cyberattacks around the world escalating rapidly, insurance companies are ramping up the requirements to qualify for a cyber insurance policy.&nbsp; Ransomware attacks were up 80% last year , prompting underwriters to put in place a number of new provisions designed to prevent ransomware and stem the record number of claims. Among these are a mandate to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all admin access in a network environment as well as protect all privileged accounts, specifically machine-to-machine connections known as service accounts.&nbsp; But identifying MFA and privileged account protection gaps within an environment can be extremely challenging for organizations, as there is no utility among the most commonly used security and identity products that can actually provide this visibility. In this article, we'll explore these identity protection challenges and suggest steps organizations can take to overcome them, including signing up for a&nbsp; free identity risk a

Do you know where your secrets are? If not, I can tell you: you are not alone. Hundreds of CISOs, CSOs, and security leaders, whether from small or large companies, don't know either. No matter the organization's size, the certifications, tools, people, and processes: secrets are not visible in 99% of cases. It might sound ridiculous at first: keeping secrets is an obvious first thought when thinking about security in the development lifecycle. Whether in the cloud or on-premise, you know that your secrets are safely stored behind hard gates that few people can access. It is not just a matter of common sense since it's also an essential compliance requirement for security audits and certifications. Developers working in your organization are well-aware that secrets should be handled with special care. They have put in place specific tools and procedures to correctly create, communicate, and rotate human or machine credentials. Still, do you know where your secrets are?

Compliance services are emerging as one of the hottest areas of cybersecurity.&nbsp; While compliance used to be mainly the province of large enterprises, times have changed, and it is now a day-to-day concern for a growing number of small and medium businesses.&nbsp; Even when these organizations are not regulated, SMEs often aim to follow compliance and/or security frameworks either for their own risk mitigation or in order to comply with the standards required by their customers. The driver is often their customers' supply chain concerns and requirements. As large businesses adopt cybersecurity and compliance frameworks and agree to certain standards, they impose similar demands on their suppliers. This is a major opportunity for providers of virtual CISO (vCISO) services assuming they can broaden their offerings to encompass compliance. MSSPs, MSPs, consultanies and other vCISO service providers perform a vital role in building a comprehensive cybersecurity program for their SME customer

A recently published&nbsp; Security Navigator &nbsp;report data shows that businesses are still taking 215 days to patch a reported vulnerability. Even for critical vulnerabilities, it generally takes more than 6 months to patch. Good vulnerability management is not about being fast enough in patching all potential breaches. It's about focusing on the real risk using vulnerability prioritization to correct the most significant flaws and reduce the company's attack surface the most. Company data and threat intelligence need to be correlated and automated. This is essential to enable internal teams focus their remediation efforts. Suitable technologies can take the shape of a global Vulnerability Intelligence Platform. Such a platform can help to prioritize vulnerabilities using a risk score and let companies focus on their real organizational risk.&nbsp; Getting Started Three facts to have in mind before establishing an effective vulnerability management program:&nbsp; 1.

Well, organizations don't enjoy running old legacy systems just for the pleasure of it, but they're often forced to keep them running because it's their only option, or at least the only cost-effective option available to them.

Top Cyber Threats Facing E-Commerce Sites This Holiday Season<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/top-cyber-threats-facing-e-commerce.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Delivering a superior customer experience is essential for any e-commerce business. For those companies, there's a lot at stake this holiday season. According to Digital Commerce 360, nearly $1.00 of every $4.00 spent on retail purchases during the 2022 holiday season will be spent online, resulting in $224 billion in e-commerce sales. To ensure your e-commerce site is ready for the holiday rush, it's vital to ensure it is secure.&nbsp;  While safety and security are top priorities for businesses of all sizes, it is essential for those who operate in the e-commerce space. To deliver the experience customers crave, many websites embed third-party solutions at every stage of the customer journey. In fact, for certain e-commerce businesses, their suite of third-party plugins is how they create and sustain a competitive advantage.&nbsp;  Yet many e-commerce sites are inherently insecure and vulnerable to attack due to their reliance on untrustworthy third-party solutions. Consequently,&nbsp; cli

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As IT professionals, we all reach a certain point in our IT career where we realize that some of our everyday tasks are done the same way year after year without anyone questioning why it's done that way.  Despite the constant change and improvement in technology, some things just get done the same ineffective way without any real thought behind it because "that's the way it's always been done."  A typical example: patching  Month in, month out, a day comes along that is dedicated to patching.&nbsp;  Patching may be more automated than before because you no longer need to log into each system to patch and reboot tediously. It's a step forward, but the patching process remains the same.&nbsp;  Patching is disruptive, slow, error-prone, and rarely fast enough to keep up with new vulnerabilities. Why disruptive? We all know that every time a maintenance window comes along, Bob from accounting will remind everyone how "the company's IT is going to mess up our week

Threat hunting with MITRE ATT&amp;CK and Wazuh<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/threat-hunting-with-mitre-att-and-wazuh.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat hunting is the process of looking for malicious activity and its artifacts in a computer system or network. Threat hunting is carried out intermittently in an environment regardless of whether or not threats have been discovered by automated security solutions. Some threat actors may stay dormant in an organization's infrastructure, extending their access while waiting for the right opportunity to exploit discovered weaknesses.  Therefore it is important to perform threat hunting to identify malicious actors in an environment and stop them before they achieve their ultimate goal.&nbsp;  To effectively perform threat hunting, the threat hunter must have a systematic approach to emulating possible adversary behavior. This adversarial behavior determines what artifacts can be searched for that indicate ongoing or past malicious activity.  MITRE ATT&amp;CK  Over the years, the security community has observed that threat actors have commonly used many tactics, techniques, and procedu

On average, organizations&nbsp; report &nbsp;using 102 business-critical SaaS applications, enabling operations of most departments across an organization, such as IT and Security, Sales, Marketing, R&amp;D, Product Management, HR, Legal, Finance, and Enablement. An attack can come from any app, no matter how robust the app is. Without visibility and control over a critical mass of an organization's entire SaaS app stack, security teams are flying blind. This is why it's important that all SaaS apps across the organization be managed at scale.&nbsp;  While this breadth of coverage is critical, each app has its own characteristics, UI, and terminology. Mitigating these threats requires a deep understanding of all security controls its configurations.&nbsp;  Learn how to automate SaaS security management .

According to a&nbsp; recent survey , 90% of CISOs running teams in small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) use a managed detection and response (MDR) service. That's a 53% increase from last year.  Why the dramatic shift to MDR?  CISOs at organizations of any size, but especially SMEs, are realizing that the threat landscape and the way we do cybersecurity are among the many things that will never look the same in a post-2020 world.&nbsp;  The increase in the number of sophisticated attacks, the heavy reliance on the cloud, limited resources and budgets (exacerbated by economic uncertainty), and a growing skills gap are all major contributors to why having an MDR service to support security operations is becoming a necessity.&nbsp;  Beyond that, there are a number of reasons for why incorporating an MDR service into your security strategy can provide exceptional value that even the people who are tightening your budget at your organization can't deny.&nbsp;  Here are just seven reasons why you (yes, you

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
When you are trying to get another layer of cyber protection that would not require a lot of resources, you are most likely choosing between a VPN service &amp; a DNS Security solution. Let's discuss both.&nbsp;  VPN Explained  VPN stands for Virtual Private Networks and basically hides your IP and provides an encrypted server by redirecting your traffic via a server run by a VPN host. It establishes a protected connection in public networks. It does protect your actions from being seen by your ISP and potential hackers, however, it does not provide full protection and can still let intrusions happen.&nbsp;  Worth noting, VPN does gain access to restricted resources in your region, but bear in mind, it might be collecting your personal data. This problem relates mostly to free and cheap VPN services. In addition to that, VPNs, depending on their type, can proxy requests or not.  Most of the free ones do not even encrypt your data. According to Cybernews, last year 20 million emails and othe

Cybersecurity Awareness Month has been going on since 2004. This year,&nbsp; Cybersecurity Awareness Month &nbsp;urged the public, professionals, and industry partners to "see themselves in cyber" in the following ways:&nbsp;   The public, by taking action to stay safe online.  Professionals, by joining the cyber workforce.  Cyber industry partners, as part of the cybersecurity solution.   CISA outlined four "things you can do" to stay safe online for individuals and families, including updating their software, thinking before they click, using strong passwords, and enabling multifactor authentication on sensitive accounts.  The industry has been teaching security tips to employees and the public for a long time. With so much repetitive media and education on cyber awareness in the rearview mirror, the returning October focus weighs on many.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The rise in the costs of data breaches, ransomware, and other cyber attacks leads to rising cyber insurance premiums and more limited cyber insurance coverage. This cyber insurance situation increases risks for organizations struggling to find coverage or facing steep increases.  Some&nbsp; Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP's &nbsp;law firm clients, for example, reported a three-fold increase in insurance rates, and carriers are making "a huge pullback" on coverage limits in the past two years. Their cybersecurity practice co-head, Michelle Reed, adds, "The reduced coverage amount can no longer shield policyholders from cyber losses. A $10 million policy can end up with a $150,000 limit on cyber frauds."  The cyber-insurance situation is so concerning that the U.S. Treasury Department recently issued a&nbsp; request for public input &nbsp;on a potential federal cyber-insurance response program. This request is in addition to the assessment led conjointly by the Federal Insura

The news surrounding the slowing economy has many wondering how much of an impact it will have on their businesses – and lives. And there's good reason to start preparing.&nbsp;  A recent survey by McKinsey &amp; Company found that 85% of small and midsize businesses plan to increase their security spending heading into 2023, while Gartner recently projected that 2022 IT spending will only grow by 3%, down from a 10% growth rate the year before.  We're already seeing businesses making cuts and freezing budgets. And smaller organizations that already have limited budgets are more vulnerable than ever. While we are still dealing with the unknown, one thing&nbsp; is &nbsp;clear: even as the economy slows down, security threats don't.  But there's hope.&nbsp;  A&nbsp; new eBook &nbsp;illuminates how one solution can not only help increase security operations efficiency but also provide economic safeguards for security teams that are already strapped for cash.&nbsp;  What is the solution?

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Facebook appears to have silently rolled out a tool that allows users to remove their contact information, such as phone numbers and email addresses, uploaded by others.  The existence of the&nbsp; tool , which is buried inside a&nbsp; Help Center page &nbsp;about " Friending ," was first reported by&nbsp; Business Insider &nbsp;last week. It's offered as a way for "Non-users" to "exercise their rights under applicable laws."   An Internet Archive search via the Wayback Machine&nbsp; shows &nbsp;that the option has been available since at least May 29, 2022.  When users&nbsp; sync the contact lists &nbsp;on their devices with Facebook (or any other service), it's worth pointing out the&nbsp; privacy violation , which stems from the fact that those contacts didn't explicitly consent to the upload.  "Someone may have uploaded their address book to Facebook, Messenger or Instagram with your contact information in it," Facebook notes in the page. "You can ask us to confirm whether

Your OT Is No Longer Isolated: Act Fast to Protect It<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/your-ot-is-no-longer-isolated-act-fast.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Not too long ago, there was a clear separation between the operational technology (OT) that drives the physical functions of a company – on the factory floor, for example – and the information technology (IT) that manages a company's data to enable management and planning.&nbsp;  As IT assets became increasingly connected to the outside world via the internet, OT remained isolated from IT – and the rest of the world.  However, the spread of Industrial IoT (IIoT) as well as the need for constant monitoring and tracking information from manufacturing and assembly lines mean the connection between IT and OT systems has greatly expanded. OT is no longer isolated. OT is now just as exposed to the outside world as IT is.  What does this mean for OT security, where hard-to-access devices needed for 24/7 production are difficult to patch? Let's take a look.  The Air Gap Is Gone  Not so long ago, any data exchange between IT and OT operated via a "sneaker net." An operator would p

Why Identity &amp; Access Management Governance is a Core Part of Your SaaS Security<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/why-identity-access-management.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Every SaaS app user and login is a potential threat; whether it's bad actors or potential disgruntled former associates, &nbsp;identity management and &nbsp; access control &nbsp;is crucial to prevent unwanted or mistaken entrances to the organization's data and systems.&nbsp;  Since enterprises have thousands to tens of thousands of users, and hundreds to thousands of different apps, ensuring each entrance point and user role is secure is no easy feat. Security teams need to monitor all identities to ensure that user activity meets their organization's security guidelines.&nbsp;  Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions administer user identities and control access to enterprise resources and applications. As identities became the new perimeter, making sure this area is governed by the security team is vital.  Gartner has recently named a new security discipline called Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) that incorporates detection mechanisms that investigate suspicious posture ch

New TikTok Privacy Policy Confirms Chinese Staff Can Access European Users' Data<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/new-tiktok-privacy-policy-confirms.html"> Full Text</a>

Popular short-form video-sharing service TikTok is revising its&nbsp; privacy policy &nbsp;for European users to make it explicitly clear that user data can be accessed by some employees from across the world, including China.  The ByteDance-owned platform, which currently stores European user data in the U.S. and Singapore, said the revision is part of its ongoing data governance efforts to limit employee access to users in the region, minimize data flows outside of it, and store the information locally.  The privacy policy update applies to users located in the U.K., the European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland, and goes into effect on December 2, 2022, according to&nbsp; The Guardian .

The breach of LA Unified School District (LAUSD) highlights the prevalence of password vulnerabilities, as criminal hackers continue to use breached credentials in increasingly frequent ransomware attacks on education.  The Labor Day weekend breach of LAUSD brought significant&nbsp; districtwide disruptions to access to email , computers, and applications. It's unclear what student or employee data the attackers exfiltrated.  There is a significant trend in ransomware breaches in education, a highly vulnerable sector. The transitory nature of students leaves accounts and passwords vulnerable. The open environments schools create to foster student exploration and the relative naivete in the sector regarding cybersecurity invite attacks.&nbsp;  The breach at LAUSD and what happened afterward  Four days post-breach, reports came that criminals had offered credentials for accounts inside the school district's network&nbsp; for sale on the dark web &nbsp;months before the attack.

The White House has recently announced a $1 billion cyber security grant program that is designed to help state and local governments improve their cyber defenses, especially about protecting critical infrastructure. The&nbsp; recent executive order &nbsp;stems from the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that was signed almost a year ago. That bill allocated $1 billion for&nbsp; protecting critical infrastructure against cyber-attack &nbsp;in the wake of a series of high-profile ransomware attacks such as the one that brought down the Colonial Pipeline.&nbsp;  Those government agencies who wish to take advantage of these funding opportunities must submit a grant proposal by mid-November. Proposals are only being accepted for the sixty days following the program's announcement.  Grant recipients can use the funding to invest in new cybersecurity initiatives or to make improvements to existing defenses. Awardees are guaranteed to receive a minimum of $2 million.

GRC tools like StandardFusion help companies &nbsp;define and implement the best practices, procedures, and governance to ensure everyone understands the risks associated with their actions and how they can affect business security, compliance, and success.

It's been a year since the release of The Ultimate SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) Checklist. If SSPM is on your radar, here's the 2023 checklist edition, which covers the critical features and capabilities when evaluating a solution.  The ease with which SaaS apps can be deployed and adopted today is remarkable, but it has become a double-edged sword. On the one hand, apps are quickly onboarded, employees can work from anywhere, and there is little need for operational management. On the other hand, there are pain points that stem from the explosion of SaaS app usage, explained by the "3 V" s:   Volume:&nbsp; Each app can have hundreds of global settings. Multiply this number by thousands – or tens (or even hundreds) of thousands – of employees. Security teams must first be able to discover all the users who are using each application, as well as familiarize themselves with&nbsp; every &nbsp;application's specific set of rules and configurations, and ensure they are co

No. There's no easy, technology-driven fix for what is really cybersecurity's biggest challenge: the actions of human beings.&nbsp;  It doesn't matter how state-of-the-art your best defenses are.

Why Organisations Need Both EDR and NDR for Complete Network Protection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/why-organisations-need-both-edr-and-ndr.html"> Full Text</a>

Endpoint devices like desktops, laptops, and mobile phones enable users to connect to enterprise networks and use their resources for their day-to-day work. However, they also expand the attack surface and make the organisation vulnerable to malicious cyberattacks and data breaches.  Why Modern Organisations Need EDR  According to the 2020 global&nbsp; risk report &nbsp;by Ponemon Institute, smartphones, laptops, mobile devices, and desktops are some of the most vulnerable entry points that allow threat actors to compromise enterprise networks. Security teams must assess and address the security risks created by these devices before they can damage the organisation. And for this, they require Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR).  EDR solutions provide real-time visibility into endpoints and detect threats like malware and ransomware. By continuously monitoring endpoints, they enable security teams to uncover malicious activities, investigate threats, and initiate appropriate responses to pr

The global cybersecurity market is flourishing. Experts at Gartner predict that the end-user spending for the information security and risk management market will grow from $172.5 billion in 2022 to $267.3 billion in 2026.&nbsp;  One big area of spending includes the art of putting cybersecurity defenses under pressure, commonly known as security testing. MarketsandMarkets forecasts the global penetration testing (pentesting) market size is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 13.7% from 2022 to 2027. However, the costs and limitations involved in carrying out a penetration test are already hindering the market growth, and consequently, many cybersecurity professionals are making moves to find an alternative solution.  Pentests aren't solving cybersecurity pain points  Pentesting can serve specific and important purposes for businesses. For example, prospective customers may ask for the results of one as proof of compliance. However, for certain challenges, this

What on earth were they thinking? That's what we – and other security experts – were wondering when content giant Patreon recently dismissed its entire internal cybersecurity team in exchange for outsourced services.  Of course, we don't know the true motivations for this move. But, as outsiders looking in, we can guess the cybersecurity implications of the decision would be inescapable for any organization.  Fire the internal team and you take a huge risk  Patreon is a content-creator site that handles billions of dollars in revenue. For reasons unknown to us, Patreon fired not just a couple of staff members or someone in middle management. No: the company fired its entire security team.&nbsp;  It's a big decision with significant consequences because it results in an incalculable loss of organizational knowledge. At the technical level, it's a loss of soft knowledge around deep system interdependencies that internal security experts will just "know" about and ac

IT Security Takeaways from the Wiseasy Hack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/it-security-takeaways-from-wiseasy-hack.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Last month Tech Crunch reported that&nbsp; payment terminal manufacturer Wiseasy had been hacked . Although Wiseasy might not be well known in North America, their Android-based payment terminals are widely used in the Asia Pacific region and hackers managed to steal passwords for 140,000 payment terminals.  How Did the Wiseasy Hack Happen?  Wiseasy employees use a cloud-based dashboard for remotely managing payment terminals. This dashboard allows the company to perform a variety of configuration and management tasks such as managing payment terminal users, adding or removing apps, and even locking the terminal.&nbsp;  Hackers were able to gain access to the Wiseasy dashboard by infecting employee's computers with malware. This allowed hackers to gain access to two different employee's dashboards, ultimately leading to a massive harvesting of payment terminal credentials once they gained access.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For cybersecurity professionals, it is a huge challenge to separate the "good guys" from the "villains". In the past, most cyberattacks could simply be traced to external cybercriminals, cyberterrorists, or rogue nation-states.&nbsp; But not anymore .  Threats from within organizations – also known as "insider threats" – are increasing and cybersecurity practitioners are feeling the pain.&nbsp;  Traditional perimeter defenses are not designed to prevent these attacks. They also struggle to keep&nbsp; external &nbsp;attackers out. Clever hackers continuously find ways in and "weaponize" their trusted status inside the network to compromise sensitive assets and orchestrate larger attacks.  And an increasing number of enterprise resources – applications, devices, data, and even people – now live outside the perimeter. It's difficult to protect these assets with legacy approaches, much less fortify the perimeter to keep attackers out completely.  How can you protect your organization in this landscape?  The

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Almost every vendor, from email gateway companies to developers of threat intelligence platforms, is positioning themselves as an XDR player. But unfortunately, the noise around XDR makes it harder for buyers to find solutions that might be right for them or, more importantly, avoid ones that don't meet their needs.&nbsp;  Stellar Cyber delivers an Open XDR solution that allows organizations to use whatever security tools they desire in their security stack, feeding alerts and logs into Stellar Cyber. Stellar Cyber's "Open" approach means their platform can work with any product. As a result, a security team can make changes without wondering if the Stellar Cyber Open XDR platform will still work.&nbsp;  Stellar Cyber address the needs of lean enterprise security teams by providing capabilities typically found in NG-SIEM, NDR, and SOAR products in their Open XDR platform, managed by a single license. This consolidation enables customers to eliminate security stack complexity.

6 Top API Security Risks! Favored Targets for Attackers If Left Unmanaged<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/6-top-api-security-risks-favored.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security threats are always a concern when it comes to APIs. API security can be compared to driving a car. You must be cautious and review everything closely before releasing it into the world. By failing to do so, you're putting yourself and others at risk.  API attacks are more dangerous than other breaches. Facebook had a 50M user account affected by an API breach, and an API data breach on the Hostinger account exposed 14M customer records.&nbsp;  If a hacker gets into your API endpoints, it could spell disaster for your project. Depending on the industries and geographies you're talking about, insecure APIs could get you into hot water. Especially in the EU, if you're serving the banking, you could face massive legal and compliance problems if you're discovered to be using insecure APIs.&nbsp;  To mitigate these risks, you need to be aware of the potential&nbsp; API vulnerabilities &nbsp;that cybercriminals can exploit.  &nbsp; 6 Commonly Overlooked API Security Risks  #1 No API Visibili

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
SecDevOps is, just like DevOps, a transformational change that organizations undergo at some point during their lifetime. Just like many other big changes, SecDevOps is commonly adopted after a reality check of some kind: a big damaging cybersecurity incident, for example.  A major security breach or, say, consistent problems in achieving development goals signals to organizations that the existing development framework doesn't work and that something new is needed. But what exactly is SecDevOps, why should you embrace it – and how can you do it more easily in practice?  The fundamentals of SecDevOps  By itself, SecDevOps is not just one single improvement. You may see it as a new tool, or set of tools, or perhaps a different mindset. Some might see SecDevOps as a culture. In reality, it's all of those factors wrapped into a new approach to development that's intended to put security first.  SecDevOps rely on highly reproducible scenarios, touching on topics such as system

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
How much time do developers spend actually writing code?  According to recent studies , developers spend more time maintaining, testing and securing existing code than they do writing or improving code. Security vulnerabilities have a bad habit of popping up during the software development process, only to surface after an application has been deployed. The disappointing part is that many of these security flaws and bugs could have been resolved in an earlier stage and there are proper methods and tools to uncover them.  How much time does a developer spend on learning to write a functioning code? And how much is spent on learning about code security? Or learning how not to code?"  Wouldn't it be better to eradicate the problem from the system rather than having it there, and then trying to detect and stop an ongoing attack targeting it?  You can test your secure coding skills with this short&nbsp; self-assessment.  The true cost of bugs  Everyone makes mistakes, even developers.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
So far 2022 confirms that passwords are not dead yet. Neither will they be anytime soon. Even though Microsoft and Apple are championing passwordless authentication methods, most applications and websites will not remove this option for a very long time.  Think about it, internal apps that you do not want to integrate with third-party identity providers, government services, legacy applications, and even SaaS providers may not want to invest in new integrations or restrict their existing authentication methods. After all, online businesses are interested in user traction, and security usually brings friction. For example, a few days ago,&nbsp; Kickstarter sent out millions of password reset &nbsp;emails "simplifying its login process," including for people that used social login without a password.&nbsp;  Though you may be able to remove passwords from many enterprise components, a large portion of third-party providers, government portals, business suppliers, and SaaS services will still

RubyGems Makes Multi-Factor Authentication Mandatory for Top Package Maintainers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/rubygems-makes-multi-factor.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
RubyGems, the official package manager for the Ruby programming language, has become the latest platform to mandate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for popular package maintainers, following the footsteps of&nbsp; NPM &nbsp;and&nbsp; PyPI .  To that end, owners of gems with over 180 million total downloads are mandated to turn on MFA effective August 15, 2022.   "Users in this category who do not have MFA enabled on the UI and API or UI and gem sign-in level will not be able to edit their profile on the web, perform privileged actions (i.e. push and yank gems, or add and remove gem owners), or sign in on the command line until they configure MFA," RubyGems&nbsp; noted .  What's more, gem maintainers who cross 165 million cumulative downloads are expected to receive reminders to turn on MFA until the download count touches the 180 million thresholds, at which point it will be made mandatory.  The development is seen as an attempt by package ecosystems to&nbsp; bolster the software supply chain

Credential Theft Is (Still) A Top Attack Method<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/credential-theft-is-still-top-attack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Credential theft is clearly still a problem. Even after years of warnings, changing password requirements, and multiple forms of authentication,&nbsp; password &nbsp;stealing remains a top attack method used by cyber criminals.  The latest&nbsp; report &nbsp;from the Ponemon Institute shares that 54% of security incidents were caused by credential theft, followed by ransomware and DDoS attacks. 59% of organizations aren't revoking credentials that are no longer needed, meaning passwords can go unattended and dormant like a sitting duck (similar to what happened with Colonial Pipeline). And&nbsp; Verizon's Data Breach Investigations Report &nbsp;cites that nearly 50% of all data breaches were caused by stolen credentials.  The stats don't lie. Cybercriminals are advancing, there's no doubt, but if there's an option to take the path of least resistance, they'll take it. Too often, that means compromising passwords and exploiting vulnerable access points.&nbsp;  Credential Theft and Critical Access

The Truth About False Positives in Security<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/the-truth-about-false-positives-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
TL;DR: As weird as it might sound, seeing a few false positives reported by a security scanner is probably a good sign and certainly better than seeing none. Let's explain why.  Introduction  False positives have made a somewhat unexpected appearance in our lives in recent years. I am, of course, referring to the COVID-19 pandemic, which required massive testing campaigns in order to control the spread of the virus. For the record, a false positive is a result that appears positive (for COVID-19 in our case), where it is actually negative (the person is not infected). More commonly, we speak of false alarms.  In computer security, we are also often confronted with false positives. Ask the security team behind any SIEM what their biggest operational challenge is, and chances are that false positives will be mentioned. A recent&nbsp; report &nbsp;estimates that as much as 20% of all the alerts received by security professionals are false positives, making it a big source of fatigue.  Yet the

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A few days ago, a friend and I were having a rather engaging conversation that sparked my excitement. We were discussing my prospects of becoming a red teamer as a natural career progression. The reason I got stirred up is not that I want to change either my job or my position, as I am a happy camper being part of Cymulate's blue team.  What upset me was that my friend could not grasp the idea that I wanted to keep working as a blue teamer because, as far as he was concerned, the only natural progression is to move to the red team.&nbsp;  Red teams include many roles ranging from penetration testers to attackers and exploit developers. These roles attract most of the buzz, and the many certifications revolving around these roles (OSCP, OSEP, CEH) make them seem fancy. Movies usually make hackers the heroes, while typically ignoring the defending side, the complexities and challenges of blue teamers' roles are far less known.  While blue teams' defending roles might not sound as

Imagine this: a company-wide lockout to the company CRM, like Salesforce, because the organization's external admin attempts to disable MFA for themselves. They don't think to consult with the security team and don't consider the security implications, only the ease which they need for their team to use their login.&nbsp;  This CRM, however, defines MFA as a top-tier security setting; for example, Salesforce has a "High Assurance Login Value" configuration and immediately locks out all users as a safety precaution. The entire organization hits a standstill and is frustrated and confused.&nbsp;  Deeply concerning, this is not a one-off event, admins for business-critical SaaS apps often sit outside the security department and have profound control. Untrained and not focused on security measures, these admins are working towards their departmental KPIs.

Image via Keeper  Right Now, Get 50% Off Keeper, the Most Trusted Name in Password Management.  In one way or another, almost every aspect of our lives is online, so it's no surprise that hackers target everything from email accounts to banks to smart home devices, looking for vulnerabilities to exploit. One of the easiest exploits is cracking a weak password. That's why using a strong, unique password for each individual account is so important. But creating and remembering strong, unique passwords for dozens of accounts is nearly impossible – unless you're using&nbsp; a top-rated password manager like Keeper .  The Problem With Weak Passwords  Image via Keeper  A strong password&nbsp; should &nbsp;be a minimum of 12 characters long, with uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and one or more special characters. More importantly, it shouldn't contain dictionary words or personal information like birthdays or names. But the average American has&nbsp; 100 passwords .

MSSPs must find ways to balance the need to please existing customers, add new ones, and deliver high-margin services against their internal budget constraints and the need to maintain high employee morale. In an environment where there are thousands of potential alerts each day and cyberattacks are growing rapidly in frequency and sophistication, this isn't an easy balance to maintain.  Customers want airtight security, but adding dozens of security tools to scan for and respond to any potential attack often means that specific analysts become experts in specific tools. It's left to the whole team to manually correlate their findings to discover and respond to multi-layered attacks, and hackers are always finding ways to exploit the gaps in coverage. This is a no-win situation where the analysts are frustrated, customers are dissatisfied, and costs can easily run out of control.  To win in the marketplace, MSSPs must find ways to make their teams highly efficient while driving higher

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The financial services industry has always been at the forefront of technology adoption, but the 2020 pandemic accelerated the widespread of mobile banking apps, chat-based customer service, and other digital tools.&nbsp; Adobe's 2022 FIS Trends Report ,&nbsp; for instance, found that more than half of the financial services and insurance firms surveyed experienced a notable increase in digital/mobile visitors in the first half of 2020. The same report found that four out of ten financial executives say that digital and mobile channels account for more than half of their sales – a trend that's only expected to continue in the next few years.  As financial institutions expand their digital footprint, they have more opportunities to better serve their customers – but are also more exposed to security threats. Every new tool increases the attack surface. A higher number of potential security gaps, may potentially lead to a higher number of security breaches.  According to the &nbsp;Cisco CISO B

Microsoft Resumes Blocking Office VBA Macros by Default After 'Temporary Pause'<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/microsoft-resumes-blocking-office-vba.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has officially resumed blocking Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros by default across Office apps, weeks after temporarily announcing plans to roll back the change.  "Based on our review of customer feedback, we've made updates to both our&nbsp; end user &nbsp;and our&nbsp; IT admin &nbsp;documentation to make clearer what options you have for different scenarios," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an update on July 20.  Earlier this February, Microsoft publicized its plans to disable macros by default in Office applications such as Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, and Word as a way to prevent threat actors from abusing the feature to deliver malware.  It's a known fact that a majority of the damaging cyberattacks today leverage email-based phishing lures to spread bogus documents containing malicious macros as a primary vector for initial access.   "Macros can add a lot of functionality to Office, but they are often used by people with bad intentions to distribute malware to

Google on Thursday said it's backtracking on a&nbsp; recent change &nbsp;that removed the app permissions list from the Google Play Store for Android across both the mobile app and the web.  "Privacy and transparency are core values in the Android community," the Android Developers team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets. "We heard your feedback that you find the app permissions section in Google Play useful, and we've decided to reinstate it. The app permissions section will be back shortly."  To that end, in addition to showcasing the new Data safety section that offers users a simplified summary of an app's data collection, processing, and security practices, Google also intends to highlight all the permissions required by the app to make sense of its "ability to access specific restricted data and actions."

Python has its pros and cons, but it's nonetheless used extensively. For example, Python is frequently used in data crunching tasks even when there are more appropriate languages to choose from.  Why? Well, Python is relatively easy to learn. Someone with a science background can pick up Python much more quickly than, say, C. However, Python's inherent approachability also creates a couple of problems.  Whenever Python is updated, it means a big refactoring workload, which often gets dealt with poorly – or not at all. That leads to poor performance and security vulnerabilities. But maybe there is a better way: a tool to keep your Python tasks running smoothly and securely day in, day out. Let's take a look.  It's slow, but it does the job  Python isn't the fastest language around, but despite its comparative disadvantages, you'll often see it used for intensive data crunching operations. Think machine learning, computer vision, or even pure math in high-perform

The New Weak Link in SaaS Security: Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/the-new-weak-link-in-saas-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Typically, when threat actors look to infiltrate an organization's SaaS apps, they look to SaaS app misconfigurations as a means of entry. However, employees now use their personal devices, whether their phones or laptops, etc., to get their jobs done. If the device's hygiene is not up to par, it increases the risk for the organization and widens the attack surface for bad actors. And so, Endpoint (Device) Protection — through EDR, XDR, and vulnerability management solutions – has arisen as a critical factor in SaaS Security.  The challenge in remediating the threats posed by endpoints and devices lies in the ability to correlate between the SaaS app users, their roles, and permissions with their associated devices' compliance and integrity levels. This end-to-end approach is what's needed for the organization to implement a holistic, zero-trust approach for their SaaS Security.&nbsp;  Not a simple feat, however, automated SaaS Security Posture Management solutions, like Ad

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Great Resignation – or the Great Reshuffle as some are calling it – and the growing skills gap have been dominating headlines lately. But these issues aren't new to the cybersecurity industry. While many are just now hearing about employee burnout, security teams have faced reality and serious consequences of burnout for years.&nbsp;  One of the biggest culprits? Alert overload.&nbsp;  The average security team gets tens of thousands of alerts&nbsp; each day . Many analysts feel like they can't get their heads above water…and are starting to give up. This looks like physical burnout and even apathy. Surveys found that some security analysts feel so overwhelmed they ignore alerts and even walk away from their computers.&nbsp;  In fact, these surveys found that&nbsp; 70% of security teams &nbsp;feel emotionally overwhelmed by alerts, and more than&nbsp; 55% of security professionals &nbsp;don't feel fully confident that they can prioritize and respond to every alert that really does need attention.&nbsp;  Sadly, th

With speculative execution attacks remaining a stubbornly persistent vulnerability ailing modern processors, new research has highlighted an "industry failure" to adopting mitigations released by AMD and Intel, posing a firmware supply chain threat.  Dubbed&nbsp; FirmwareBleed &nbsp;by Binarly, the information leaking assaults stem from the continued exposure of microarchitectural attack surfaces on the part of enterprise vendors either as a result of not correctly incorporating the fixes or only using them partially.  "The impact of such attacks is focused on disclosing the content from privileged memory (including protected by virtualization technologies) to obtain sensitive data from processes running on the same processor (CPU)," the firmware protection firm&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "Cloud environments can have a greater impact when a physical server can be shared by multiple users or legal entities."  In recent years, implementations of

Google Removes "App Permissions" List from Play Store for New "Data Safety" Section<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/google-removes-app-permissions-list.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Following the launch of a new "Data safety" section for the Android app on the Play Store, Google appears to be readying to remove the app permissions list from both the mobile app and the web.  The change was&nbsp; highlighted &nbsp;by Esper's Mishaal Rahman earlier this week.  The&nbsp; Data safety &nbsp;section, which Google began rolling out in late April 2022, is the company's answer to Apple's Privacy Nutrition Labels in iOS, allowing users to have a unified view of an app's data collection and processing practices.   To that end, third-party app developers are required to furnish the required details by July 20, 2022. With this deadline now approaching next week, the tech giant has moved to entirely remove the permissions section.  The decision also appears to be a hasty one, as a number of popular apps such as Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Amazon (including Amazon Prime Video), DuckDuckGo, Discord, and PhonePe are yet to populate their Data safety sections.

New survey reveals lack of staff, skills, and resources driving smaller teams to outsource security.

Compared to 2021, double the number of CISOs and their organizations are seeing the value of extended detection and response (XDR) tools, which combine EDR with integrated network signals.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Although there is a greater awareness of cybersecurity threats than ever before, it is becoming increasingly difficult for IT departments to get their security budgets approved. Security budgets seem to shrink each year and IT pros are constantly being asked to do more with less. Even so, the situation may not be hopeless. There are some things that IT pros can do to improve the chances of getting their security budgets approved.  &nbsp;Presenting the Problem in a Compelling Way  If you want to get your proposed security budget approved, you will need to present security problems in a compelling way. While those who are in charge of the organization's finances are likely aware of the need for good security, they have probably also seen enough examples of "a security solution in search of a problem" to make them skeptical of security spending requests. If you want to persuade those who control the money, then you will need to convince them of three things:   You are trying to

Often, organizations think of firewall security as a one-and-done type of solution. They install firewalls, then assume that they are "good to go" without investigating whether or not these solutions are actually protecting their systems in the best way possible. "Set it and forget it!"  Instead of just relying on firewalls and assuming that they will always protect their businesses from cyber risk, executives need to start asking deeper questions about them. As with most areas of business, it's important to take a critical look at each solution that your organization relies on for security. So, let's break down a few questions that you and your team should be asking about firewall security to get a more accurate view into your network defense posture.  1 — What does your team's&nbsp;firewall knowledge look like?

Avoiding Death by a Thousand Scripts: Using Automated Content Security Policies<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/avoiding-death-by-thousand-scripts.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Businesses know they need to secure their client-side scripts. Content security policies (CSPs) are a great way to do that. But CSPs are cumbersome. One mistake and you have a potentially significant client-side security gap. Finding those gaps means long and tedious hours (or days) in manual code reviews through thousands of lines of script on your web applications. Automated content security policies can help streamline the code review process by first identifying all first- and third-party scripts and the assets they access, and then generating an appropriate content security policy to help better secure the client-side attack surface.   There are few developers or AppSec professionals who claim to enjoy deploying CSPs. First, the CSP has to work for the specific web application. Then the team needs to make sure it provides the appropriate level of protection. The CSP also can't conflict with any existing widgets or plugins (or the decision must be made to not deploy the CSP or dea

(2) Employees are granting 3rd party app access to core SaaS apps that pose potential threats to the company. (3) These SaaS apps are accessed by different devices without their device hygiene score even being checked.&nbsp;  1 — Misconfiguration Management   It's not an easy task to have every app setting properly configured — at all times.

Progress powers technology forward. But progress also has a cost: by adding new capabilities and features, the developer community is constantly adjusting the building blocks. That includes the fundamental languages used to code technology solutions.  When the building blocks change, the code behind the technology solution must change too. It's a challenging and time-consuming exercise that drains resources. But what if there's an alternative?  The problem: reading code someone else wrote  Let's take a step back and take a look at one of the fundamental challenges in development: editing someone else's code. Editing code you just wrote, or wrote a couple of weeks ago, is just fine. But editing your own code written years ago – never mind someone else's code - that's a different story.  In-house code style rules can help but there are always odd naming conventions for variables and functions, or unusual choices for algorithms. Arguably, a programmer's abilit

By aggregating intrusion signals from our community, we can offer a clear picture of what is going on in terms of illegal hacking in the world.  After 2 years of activity and analyzing 1 million intrusion signals daily from tens of thousands of users in 160 countries, we start having an accurate "Batman sonar" global feed of cyber threats. And there are some interesting takeaways to outline.  A cyber threat with many faces&nbsp;  First of all, the global cyber threat is highly versatile. What do we see when looking at the type

July may positively disrupt and adrenalize the old-fashioned Dynamic Application Security Scanning (DAST) market, despite the coming holiday season. The pathbreaking innovation comes from ImmuniWeb, a global application security company, well known for, among other things, its free&nbsp; Community Edition &nbsp;that processes over 100,000 daily security scans of web and mobile apps.&nbsp;  Today, ImmuniWeb announced that its new product –&nbsp; Neuron &nbsp;– is publicly available. This would be another boring press release by a software vendor, but the folks from ImmuniWeb managed to add a secret sauce that you will unlikely be able to resist tasting. The DAST scanning service is flexibly available as a SaaS, and unsurprisingly contains all fashionable features commonly advertised by competitors on the rapidly growing global market, spanning from native CI/CD integrations to advanced configuration of security scanning, pre-programmed or authenticated testing.&nbsp;  But the groundbreaking feature is Neuron's

Change is a part of life, and nothing stays the same for too long, even with hacking groups, which are at their most dangerous when working in complete silence. The notorious REvil&nbsp; ransomware &nbsp;gang, linked to the infamous JBS and Kaseya, has resurfaced three months after the arrest of its members in Russia.  The Russian domestic intelligence service, the FSB, had caught 14 people from the gang. In this apprehension, the 14 members of the gang were found in possession of 426 million roubles, $600,000, 500,000 euros, computer equipment, and 20 luxury cars were brought to justice.  REvil Ransomware Gang- The Context  The financially-motivated cybercriminal threat group Gold Southfield controlled ransomware group known as REvil emerged in 2019 and spread like wildfire after extorting $11 million from the meat-processor JBS.

Shadow IT refers to the practice of users deploying unauthorized technology resources in order to circumvent their IT department. Users may resort to using shadow IT practices when they feel that existing IT policies are too restrictive or get in the way of them being able to do their jobs effectively.  An old school phenomenon&nbsp;  Shadow IT is not new. There have been countless examples of widespread shadow IT use over the years. In the early 2000s, for example, many organizations were reluctant to adopt Wi-Fi for fear that it could undermine their security efforts. However, users wanted the convenience of wireless device usage and often deployed wireless access points without the IT department's knowledge or consent.  The same thing happened when the iPad first became popular. IT departments largely prohibited iPads from being used with business data because of the inability to apply group policy settings and other security controls to the devices. Even so, users often ignored IT and

These experts observed the dynamic code loading and its potential dangers. Why is this a problem? Well, the Google app uses code that does not come integrated with the app itself. Okay, this might sound confusing, but it all works in favor of optimizing certain processes. Thus, Google exploits code libraries pre-installed on Android phones to reduce their download size. In fact, many Android apps use this trick to optimize the storage space needed to run.&nbsp;  As revealed by Oversecured, perpetrators could compromise this retrieval of code from libraries. Instead of Google obtaining code from a reliable source, it could be tricked into taking code from malicious apps operating on the devic

Just before last Christmas, in a first-of-a-kind case, JPMorgan was fined $200M for employees using non-sanctioned applications for communicating about financial strategy. No mention of insider trading, naked shorting, or any malevolence. Just employees circumventing regulation using, well, Shadow IT. Not because they tried to obfuscate or hide anything, simply because it was a convenient tool that they preferred over any other sanctioned products (which JPMorgan certainly has quite a few of.)&nbsp;  Visibility into unknown and unsanctioned applications has been required by regulators and also recommended by the Center for Internet Security community for a long time. Yet it seems like new and better approaches are still in demand. Gartner has identified External Attack Surface Management, Digital Supply Chain Risk, and Identity Threat Detection as the top three trends to focus on in 2022, all of which are closely intertwined with Shadow IT.

However, while companies adopt more and more apps, their increase in SaaS security tools and staff has lagged behind, as found in the&nbsp; 2022 SaaS Security Survey Report.&nbsp;  The survey report, completed by Adaptive Shield in conjunction with Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), dives into how CISOs today are managing the growing SaaS app attack surface and the steps they are taking to secure their organizations.&nbsp;  The report finds that at least 43% of organizations have experienced a security incident as a result of a SaaS misconfiguration; however, with another 20% being "unsure," the real number could be&nbsp; as high as 63% . These numbers are particularly striking when compared to the 17% of organizations experiencing security incidents due to an IaaS misconfiguration.&nbsp;  Bearing this

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ransomware has been a thorn in the side of cybersecurity teams for years. With the move to remote and hybrid work, this insidious threat has become even more of a challenge for&nbsp; organizations everywhere.  2021 was a case study in ransomware due to the wide variety of attacks, significant financial and economic impact, and diverse ways that organizations responded.&nbsp; These attacks &nbsp;should be seen as a lesson that can inform future security strategies to mitigate ransomware risk. As an organization continues to evolve, so should its security strategy.  The Remote Environment Is Primed for Ransomware  With organizations continuing to support remote and hybrid work, they no longer have the visibility and control they once had inside their perimeter. Attackers are&nbsp; exploiting this weakness&nbsp; and profiting. Here are three reasons they're able to do so:  Visibility and control have changed.&nbsp; Most organizations now have employees working from anywhere. These employees expect seamless access to

It was first the pandemic that changed the usual state of work - before, it was commuting, working in the office &amp; coming home for most corporate employees. Then, when we had to adapt to the self-isolation rules, the work moved to home offices, which completely changed the workflow for many businesses. As the pandemic went down, we realized success never relied on where the work was done. Whether your office is your kitchen, your bedroom, a nearby cafe, or your actual workplace in an office building, it all comes down to the fact that job success has nothing to do with your location.&nbsp;  The role of the office in the hybrid era is also changing - according to the research conducted by&nbsp; PwC , it now serves the purpose of collaborating with team members and building relationships. From an employee's side, it sounds pretty logical and obvious.&nbsp;  However, if we look at hybrid work with the eyes of an employer, things get complicated. How does one make sure corporate devices &amp; da

Breaches don't just happen to large enterprises. Threat actors are increasingly targeting small businesses. In fact,&nbsp; 43% &nbsp;of data breaches involved small to medium-sized businesses. But there is a glaring discrepancy. Larger businesses typically have the budget to keep their lights on if they are breached.

The most recent evolution of cybersecurity technology is extended detection and response (XDR).  There's no doubt you've heard of it.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In 2017, The Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC) published a set of mitigation strategies that were designed to help organizations to protect themselves against cyber security incidents. These strategies, which became known as&nbsp; the Essential Eight , are designed specifically for use on Windows networks, although variations of these strategies are commonly applied to other platforms.  What is the Essential Eight?&nbsp;  The Essential Eight is essentially a cyber security framework that is made up of objectives and controls (with each objective including multiple controls). Initially, the Australian government only mandated that companies adhere to four of the security controls that were included in the first objective. Starting in June of 2022 however, all 98 non-corporate Commonwealth entities (NCCEs) are going to be&nbsp; required to comply with the entire framework .  Non-Australians take note&nbsp;  Although the Essential Eight is specific to Australia, organizations outside of Australia shou

Common cybercriminals are a menace, there's no doubt about it – from bedroom hackers through to ransomware groups, cybercriminals are causing a lot of damage. But both the tools used and the threat posed by common cybercriminals pale in comparison to the tools used by more professional groups such as the famous hacking groups and state-sponsored groups.  In fact, these tools can prove almost impossible to detect – and guard against. BVP47 is a case in point. In this article, we'll outline how this powerful state-sponsored malware has been quietly circulating for years, how it so cleverly disguises itself, and explain what that means for cybersecurity in the enterprise.  Background story behind BVP47  It's a long story, fit for a spy novel. Earlier this year, a Chinese cybersecurity research group called Pangu Lab published an in-depth, 56-page report covering a piece of malicious code that the research group decided to call BVP47 (because BVP was the most common string in

Carnegie Mellen found that as much as 28% of end-users willingly share passwords with others, and a Specops study found that of those who share passwords 21% of people don't know who else their password has been shared with. That's a lot of sharing going on.

Be Proactive! Shift Security Validation Left<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/be-proactive-shift-security-validation.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
"Shifting (security)" left approach in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) means starting security earlier in the process. As organizations realized that software never comes out perfectly and are riddled with many exploitable holes, bugs, and business logic vulnerabilities that require going back to fix and patch, they understood that building secure software requires incorporating and consolidating numerous resources.  This conclusion led DevOps and R&amp;D leaders to become proactive, acquiring technology to find and close these gaps in advance, with the aim of reducing the cost and effort while improving the quality of their outcomes.&nbsp;  With emerging comprehensive&nbsp; continuous security validation technology , the demonstrated benefits of 'shifting left' as a fundamental part of SDLC can now be applied to your cybersecurity program, with results far exceeding the purely technical aspects of security posture management.&nbsp;  At the development level, the conceptuali

As many as 47,337 malicious plugins have been uncovered on 24,931 unique websites, out of which 3,685 plugins were sold on legitimate marketplaces, netting the attackers $41,500 in illegal revenues.  The findings come from a new tool called&nbsp; YODA &nbsp;that aims to detect rogue WordPress plugins and track down their origin, according to an 8-year-long study conducted by a group of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology.  "Attackers impersonated benign plugin authors and spread malware by distributing pirated plugins," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new paper titled " Mistrust Plugins You Must ."   "The number of malicious plugins on websites has steadily increased over the years, and malicious activity peaked in March 2020. Shockingly, 94% of the malicious plugins installed over those 8 years are still active today."

An analysis of the mobile threat landscape in 2022 shows that Spain and Turkey are the most targeted countries for malware campaigns, even as a mix of new and existing banking trojans are increasingly targeting Android devices to conduct on-device fraud (ODF).  Other frequently targeted countries include Poland, Australia, the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Italy, France, and Portugal.  "The most worrying leitmotif is the increasing attention to On-Device Fraud (ODF)," Dutch cybersecurity company ThreatFabric&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "Just in the first five months of 2022 there has been an increase of more than 40% in malware families that abuse Android OS to perform fraud using the device itself, making it almost impossible to detect them using traditional fraud scoring engines."   Hydra ,&nbsp; FluBot &nbsp;(aka Cabassous),&nbsp; Cerberus ,&nbsp; Octo , and&nbsp; ERMAC &nbsp;accounted for the most active banking trojans based on the number of samples observed during the same

It's no secret that 3rd party apps can boost productivity, enable remote and hybrid work and are overall, essential in building and scaling a company's work processes.&nbsp;  An innocuous process much like clicking on an attachment was in the earlier days of email, people don't think twice when connecting an app they need with their Google workspace or M365 environment, etc. Simple actions that users take, from creating an email to updating a contact in the CRM, can result in several other automatic actions and notifications in the connected platforms.&nbsp;  As seen in the image below, the OAuth mechanism makes it incredibly easy to interconnect apps and many don't consider what the possible ramifications could be. When these apps and other add-ons for SaaS platforms ask for permissions' access, they are usually granted without a second thought, presenting more opportunities for bad actors to gain access to a company's data. This puts companies at risk for supply chain

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security incidents occur. It's not a matter of "if," but of "when." That's why you implemented security products and procedures to optimize the incident response (IR) process.  However, many security pros who are doing an excellent job in handling incidents find effectively communicating the ongoing process with their management a much more challenging task.  Feels familiar?  In many organizations, leadership is not security savvy, and they aren't interested in the details regarding all the bits and bytes in which the security pro masters.&nbsp;  Luckily, there is a template that security leads can use when presenting to management. It's called the&nbsp; IR Reporting for Management template , providing CISOs and CIOs with a clear and intuitive tool to report both the ongoing IR process and its conclusion.  The IR Reporting for Management template enables CISOs and CIOs to communicate with the two key points that management cares about—assurance that the incid

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Containers revolutionized the development process, acting as a cornerstone for DevOps initiatives, but containers bring complex security risks that are not always obvious. Organizations that don't mitigate these risks are vulnerable to attack.&nbsp;  In this article, we outline how containers contributed to agile development, which unique security risks containers bring into the picture – and what organizations can do to secure containerized workloads, going beyond DevOps to achieve&nbsp; DevSecOps .  Why did containers catch on so fast?  Containers are, in many ways, the evolution of virtualization. The goal was to speed up the development process, creating a more agile route from development through to testing and implementation – a method that's more lightweight than using full-blown virtual machines, anyway.  At the core of this issue is application compatibility, as applications require certain versions of libraries – which could clash with the requirements of other applications. Container

Traditional businesses migrating to the cloud need robust information security mechanisms.&nbsp; Gartner predicts&nbsp; that more than 95% of new digital workloads will continue to be deployed on cloud-native platforms by 2025.  Robust&nbsp; cloud data security &nbsp;is imperative for businesses adopting rapid digital transformation to the cloud. While a traditional hosting model could be considered more secure, not all organizations are receptive to relinquishing control over their infrastructure or applications by relying on a cloud provider at an increased risk of data theft from a cyberattack done by an outsider.  Having said so, let's try to understand the vital part.  What is Cloud Data Security?&nbsp;  Cloud data security entails securing data, whether at rest or in motion, on cloud-based infrastructure, applications, etc., against cyber threats like data breaches, unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, etc.  This includes the technologies, policies, controls, and services to protect cloud-based system

Are you aware of fake clickjacking bug bounty reports? If not, you should be. This article will get you up to speed and help you to stay alert.  What are clickjacking bug bounty reports?  If we start by breaking up the term into its component parts, a bug bounty is a program offered by an organization, in which individuals are rewarded for finding and reporting software bugs. These programs are often used by companies as a cost-effective way to find and fix software vulnerabilities, thereby improving the security of their products. They also help to build goodwill with the security community.&nbsp;  For the bounty hunters (or white hat hackers), they have an opportunity to earn money and recognition for their skills.&nbsp;  Clickjacking is a malicious technique used to trick users into clicking on something that they think is safe, but is actually harmful. For example, a hacker could create a fake button that looks like the "like" button on a social media site. When users click on it,

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The mass adoption of cloud infrastructure is fully justified by innumerable advantages. As a result, today, organizations' most sensitive business applications, workloads, and data are in the cloud.  Hackers, good and bad, have noticed that trend and effectively evolved their attack techniques to match this new tantalizing target landscape. With threat actors' high reactivity and adaptability, it is recommended to assume that organizations are under attack and that some user accounts or applications might already have been compromised.  Finding out exactly which assets are put at risk through compromised accounts or breached assets requires mapping potential attack paths across a comprehensive map of all the relationships between assets.&nbsp;  Today, mapping potential attack paths is performed with scanning tools such as AzureHound or AWSPX. Those are graph-based tools enabling the visualization of assets and resources relationships within the related cloud service provider.  By r

As more and more businesses are implementing APIs, the risk of API attacks increases.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actor groups like Wizard Spider and Sandworm have been wreaking havoc over the past few years – developing and deploying cybercrime tools like Conti, Trickbot, and Ryuk ransomware. Most recently, Sandworm (suspected to be a Russian cyber-military unit) unleashed cyberattacks against Ukranian infrastructure targets.  To ensure cybersecurity providers are battle ready, MITRE Engenuity uses real-world attack scenarios and tactics implemented by threat groups to test security vendors' capabilities to protect against threats – the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Evaluation. Each vendor's detections and capabilities are assessed within the context of the&nbsp; MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework.  This year, they used the tactics seen in Wizard Spider and Sandworm's during their evaluation simulations. And MITRE Engenuity didn't go easy on these participating vendors. As mentioned before – the stakes are too high, and risk is growing.  The 2022 results overview  To think about it simply, this MITRE ATT&amp;CK Ev

Node-ipc is a prominent&nbsp; node module &nbsp;used for local and remote inter-process communication with support for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It has over 1.1 million weekly downloads.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As much as threat mitigation is to a degree a specialist task involving cybersecurity experts, the day to day of threat mitigation often still comes down to systems administrators. For these sysadmins it's not an easy task, however. In enterprise IT, sysadmins teams have a wide remit but limited resources.  For systems administrators finding the time and resources to mitigate against a growing and constantly moving threat is challenging. In this article, we outline the difficulties implied by enterprise threat mitigation, and explain why automated, purpose-built mitigation tools are the way forward.  Threat management is an overwhelming task  There is a range of specialists that work within threat management, but the practical implementation of threat management strategies often comes down to systems administrators. Whether it's patch management, intrusion detection or remediation after an attack, sysadmins typically bear the brunt of the work.  It's an impossible task, gi

There's something about craftsmanship. It's personal, its artistry, and it can be incredibly effective in achieving its goals. On the other hand, mass-market production can be effective in other ways, through speed, efficiency, and cost savings.  The story of data centers is one of going from craftsmanship – where every individual machine is a pet project, maintained with great care – to mass production with big server farms where individual units are completely disposable.  In this article, we take a look at how data centers have changed shape over the decades. We examine the implications for data center workloads, and for the people that run them – who have now lost their pet systems. We'll also review the cybersecurity implications of the new data center landscape.

Getting Your SOC 2 Compliance as a SaaS Company<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/getting-your-soc-2-compliance-as-saas.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
If you haven't heard of the&nbsp; term , you will soon enough. SOC 2, meaning  System and Organization Controls 2 , is an auditing procedure developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA). Having SOC 2 compliance means you have implemented organizational controls and practices that provide assurance for the safeguarding and security of client data. In other words, you have to show (e.g., document and demonstrate) that you are acting in good faith with other people's information. In its simplest definition, it's a report card from an auditor.&nbsp;  At Rewind, before SOC 2, we had some processes in place, such as change management procedures for when emergency fixes need to be released to production quickly. But after beginning our SOC 2 journey we realized that we did not have a great way to track the reasoning behind a required emergency change, and this was required for our SOC 2 audit.

Dubbed&nbsp; DrawnApart , the method "identifies a device from the unique properties of its GPU stack," researchers from Australia, France, and Israel said in a new paper," adding " variations in speed among the multiple execution units that comprise a GPU can serve as a reliable and robust device signature, which can be collected using unprivileged JavaScript."  A device fingerprint or machine fingerprint is information that is collected about the hardware, installed software, as well as the web browser and its associated add-ons from a remote computing device for the purpose of unique identification.

XDR: Redefining the game for MSSPs serving SMBs and SMEs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/xdr-redefining-game-for-mssps-serving.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
SMBs and SMEs are increasingly turning to MSSPs to secure their businesses because they simply do not have the resources to manage an effective security technology stack. However, it's also challenging for MSSPs to piece together an effective but manageable security technology stack to protect their clients, especially at an affordable price point.  This is where Extended Detection and Response (XDR) comes in and can help MSSPs boost their profitability from SMB and SME and improve their protections. XDR is heating up within the MSSP market as these security service providers stand to gain tremendous financial and operational benefits from this nascent technology. XDR promises far better security outcomes at a lower cost than the current security stack approaches most MSSPs currently have in place.  One sticky point that keeps arising in the XDR discussion has to do with the different technology approaches XDR providers rely upon to deliver platform capabilities. Most of us have heard

How Can You Leave Log4J in 2021?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/how-can-you-leave-log4j-in-2021.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
With the last month of 2021 dominated by the log4J vulnerabilities discovery, publication, and patches popping up in rapid succession, odds are you have patched your system against Log4J exploitation attempts. At least some systems, if not all. You might even have installed the latest patch – at the time of writing, that is 2.17.1, but, if the last rapid patching cycle persists, it might have changed by the time this is published.  In the meantime, defenders might have been working overtime to plug Log4J born security gaps, but so did cyber-attackers. Log4J's well-deserved fame also alerted cyber-attackers to a potential entry pathway into their target. And, while log4J will hopefully vanish from the headlines,&nbsp; cyber-attackers are likely to continue trying to exploit it &nbsp;in the hope of finding unpatched or incompletely patched targets.  As human error still accounts&nbsp; for 95% of all security breaches , cyber-attackers actively rely on these human errors to exploit them and take advant

2022 Cybersecurity Predictions from Lookout: Work From Anywhere Ends On-Premises Security<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/2022-cybersecurity-predictions-from.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Lookout , an endpoint-to-cloud cyber security company, have put together their cyber security predictions for 2022.&nbsp;  1&nbsp; —&nbsp; Cloud connectivity and cloud-to-cloud connectivity will amplify supply-chain breaches  One area organizations need to continue to monitor in 2022 is the software supply chain. We tend to think of cloud apps as disparate islands used as destinations by endpoints and end-users to collect and process data. The reality is that these apps constantly communicate with different entities and systems like software-update infrastructure and with each other — interactions that are often not monitored.  In late 2020, the cybersecurity community uncovered one of the worst breaches in recent memory when the&nbsp; SolarWinds &nbsp;software-publishing infrastructure was infiltrated. More than 100 organizations, including nine U.S. federal agencies, were compromised by trojanized updates that opened backdoors to their infrastructure. This is a prime example of how a weak supply chain can b

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In May 2017, the first documented ransomware assault on networked medical equipment happened. The worldwide ransomware assault WannaCry compromised radiological and other instruments in several hospitals during its height, after a software failure caused by a cyberattack on its third-party vendor's oncology cloud service, cancer patients having radiation therapy at four healthcare institutions had to reschedule appointments.  These examples show how cyberattacks and data breaches may have a significant impact on the healthcare industry, heavily reliant on connected medical equipment. PHI (patient health information) captured and stored in these connected medical devices must be secured. Because PHI is transferred over the cloud via server-based systems, making it very susceptible to hackers.  Ransomware attacks on health care professionals have become more common, sophisticated, and severe in recent years. Individual bad actors have been supplanted as the main perpetrators by orga

One of the harsh realities of cybersecurity today is that malicious actors and attackers don't distinguish between organizations that have seemingly endless resources and those operating with lean IT security teams. For these lean teams, meeting the challenges in the current security landscape requires constant attention, and sometimes a little support.  XDR provider Cynet has built a new minisite ( find it here ) with the goal of giving these lean IT Security teams a space to find answers, share their wins and strategies, gain new insights, and have some fun in the process. The company refers to these lean teams and the people that make them up as Lean IT Security Heroes.  These groups often work with fewer resources, but are always able to defend against massive threats through creativity, ingenuity, and hard work. This new Lean IT Security Heroes minisite offers a variety of activities and tools that are ideal for lean teams looking to enhance their defenses.  Additionally, the sit

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Every Product Manager and Software Developer&nbsp;should know that pushing feature updates to production via traditional channels is as archaic as painting on cave walls. The smart are always quick to adapt to new, innovative technologies, and this mindset is exactly what makes normal companies great.  The landscape is changing fast, especially in IT . Change isn't just necessary, but more often than not, it's the single-most-important variable that determines a company's chances of survival.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is that NOT using Feature Flags leads to a more cumbersome, expensive, and slower type of rollout.  Simply put, it makes your project less competitive with those that have their deployments better organized, and that's&nbsp; an edge that you can't afford to lose .   Feature Flags are changing how things work  Many companies are using Feature Flags these days, and for good measure. &nbsp;It's safer and allows for more granular control over what you're building.

Threats can take different forms with the intent to commit fraud and damage businesses and people.

When new threats emerge, attackers take advantage of them – however, most businesses are only aware of the current threats.  Organizations struggle to address these threats due to their resource sophistication and their lack of understanding of evolving threat landscapes. For these reasons, organizations need visibility on the advanced threats especially targeting their infrastructure. This article will o

Winter is Coming for CentOS 8—but here is how you can enjoy your holidays after all.  The server environment is complex and if you're managing thousands of Linux servers, the last thing you want is for an operating system vendor to do something completely unexpected.  That is exactly what Red Hat, the parent company of the CentOS Project, did when it suddenly announced a&nbsp; curtailment of support for CentOS 8 &nbsp;– sending thousands of organizations scrambling for an alternative.  In this article, we'll review what happened with CentOS 8 and what it means for users who have already upgraded from CentOS release 7 to release 8. We'll also look at your alternatives for replacing CentOS 8.  Finally, we'll do a review of your other option: choosing extended support. Extended lifecycle support (ELS) can reduce the pressure to decide on alternative distribution and it may well be the most practical route for many CentOS 8 users.  Official support is critical  The difficulties arou

Code injection attacks, the infamous king of vulnerabilities, have lost the top spot to broken access control as the worst of the worst, and developers need to take notice.  In this increasingly chaotic world, there have always been a few constants that people could reliably count on: The sun will rise in the morning and set again at night, Mario will always be cooler than Sonic the Hedgehog, and code injection attacks will always occupy the top spot on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) list of the&nbsp; top ten most common &nbsp;and dangerous vulnerabilities that attackers are actively exploiting.  Well, the sun will rise tomorrow, and Mario still has "one-up" on Sonic, but code injection attacks have fallen out of the number one spot on the infamous OWASP list, refreshed in 2021. One of the oldest forms of attacks,&nbsp; code injection vulnerabilities &nbsp;have been around almost as long as computer networking.

Representatives from the U.S., the European Union, and 30 other countries pledged to mitigate the risk of ransomware and harden the financial system from exploitation with the goal of disrupting the ecosystem, calling it an "escalating global security threat with serious economic and security consequences."&nbsp;  "From malign operations against local health providers that endanger patient care, to those directed at businesses that limit their ability to provide fuel, groceries, or other goods to the public, ransomware poses a significant risk to critical infrastructure, essential services, public safety, consumer protection and privacy, and economic prosperity," officials&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement released last week.

All third-party iOS, iPadOS, and macOS apps that allow users to create an account should also provide a method for terminating their accounts from within the apps beginning next year, Apple said on Wednesday.  "This requirement applies to all app submissions starting January 31, 2022," the iPhone maker&nbsp; said , urging developers to "review any laws that may require you to maintain certain types of data, and to make sure your app clearly explains what data your app collects, how it collects that data, all uses of that data, your data retention/deletion policies."   While the feature could be convenient, it's worth noting that Apple only says the mechanism should have a provision for users to "initiate deletion of their account from within the app," meaning it's possible that apps could redirect users to a website or prompt them to send an email in order actually to purge their information.  The reminder follows updates to&nbsp; App Store Review Guideline

Professional developers want to embrace DevSecOps and write secure code, but their organizations need to support this seachange if they want that effort to grow.  The cyber threat landscape is becoming more complex by the day. Attackers are constantly scanning networks for vulnerable applications, programs, cloud instances, and the latest flavor of the month is APIs, widely considered an easy win thanks to their often lax security controls.  They are so persistent that new apps can sometimes be compromised and exploited within hours of deployment. The Verizon 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report makes it very clear that the threats leveled against businesses and organizations&nbsp; are more dangerous &nbsp;today than at any other point in history.  It's becoming very clear that the only way to truly fortify the software being created is to ensure that it's built on secure code. In other words, the best way to stop the threat actor invasion is to deny them a foothold into your applications in

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Sysadmins know what the risks are of running unpatched services. Given the choice, and unlimited resources, most hardworking administrators will ensure that all systems and services are patched consistently.  But things are rarely that simple. Technical resources are limited, and patching can often be more complicated than it appears at first glance. Worse, some services are so hidden in the background, that they just don't make it onto the list of things to be patched.  QEMU is one of those services that tend to create difficulties with patching. It works away in the background and is easy to take for granted. Plus, patching QEMU involves significant technical and practical challenges – while requiring enormous resources.  In this article, we'll address some of the difficulties around patching QEMU, and point to a solution that takes the toughest bits out of QEMU patching.  Ignoring QEMU patching is a big risk  You'll probably know about it if you're using QEMU – shor

In the classic children's movie 'The Princess Bride,' one of the characters utters the phrase, " You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means ."  It's freely used as a response to someone's misuse or misunderstanding of a word or phrase.   "Response Automation" is another one of those phrases that have different meanings to different people. It's bantered around by the security vendor community so much that its precise meaning, when used, is unclear.  Many vendors throw the term out without explaining exactly what they mean by the phrase. One vendor's response automation might, and often do, perform very differently from another vendor's response automation capabilities. But, hey, they have "response automation!"

Zero Trust Requires Cloud Data Security with Integrated Continuous Endpoint Risk Assessment<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/zero-trust-requires-cloud-data-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Every once in a while, an industry term will get overused by marketing to the point of becoming a cliche. "Zero Trust" may have reached this threshold.  In some ways, we understand why this is happening. Security perimeters have become obsolete as people use mobile devices and cloud applications to work from anywhere. Zero Trust deployment — moving all your apps and data to the cloud and assuming no user or device is trustworthy until proven otherwise in order to gain access — has been rapidly introduced as a result of the pandemic.  However, most attempts at achieving Zero Trust access today are a patchwork of disparate products from different vendors connected to virtual private networks (VPN), with rudimentary on-off access controls based on limited visibility.  Cloud security company,&nbsp; Lookout , believes a modern approach to Zero Trust needs to take into account the fact that data has moved to the cloud and users are working from anywhere, on any device, and connecting o

Fighting the Rogue Toaster Army: Why Secure Coding in Embedded Systems is Our Defensive Edge<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/fighting-rogue-toaster-army-why-secure.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
There are plenty of pop culture references to rogue AI and robots, and appliances turning on their human masters. It is the stuff of science fiction, fun, and fantasy, but with IoT and connected devices becoming more prevalent in our homes, we need more discussion around cybersecurity and safety.  Software is all around us, and it's very easy to forget just how much we're relying on lines of code to do all those clever things that provide us so much innovation and convenience.  Much like web-based software, APIs, and mobile devices, vulnerable code in embedded systems can be exploited if it is uncovered by an attacker.&nbsp;  While it's unlikely that an army of toasters is coming to enslave the human race (although, the&nbsp; Tesla bot &nbsp;is a bit concerning) as the result of a cyberattack, malicious cyber events are still possible. Some of our cars, planes, and medical devices also rely on intricate embedded systems code to perform key tasks, and the prospect of these objects being compromised i

[Ebook] The Guide for Speeding Time to Response for Lean IT Security Teams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/ebook-guide-for-speeding-time-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Most cyber security today involves much more planning, and much less reacting than in the past. Security teams spend most of their time preparing their organizations' defenses and doing operational work. Even so, teams often must quickly spring into action to respond to an attack.  Security teams with copious resources can quickly shift between these two modes. They have enough resources to allocate to respond properly. Lean IT security teams, however, are more hard-pressed to react effectively. A new guide by XDR provider Cynet ( download here ), however, argues that lean teams can still respond effectively. It just takes some work.&nbsp;  For teams that are resource-constrained, success starts with having a clear plan and putting the tools and infrastructure in place for the organization to follow properly. The guide breaks down the tools, factors, and knowledge that go into optimizing an organization's time to respond.&nbsp;  Building a successful incident response plan  Today's

Is Traffic Mirroring for NDR Worth the Trouble? We Argue It Isn't<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/is-traffic-mirroring-for-ndr-worth.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) is an emerging technology developed to close the blind security spots left by conventional security solutions, which hackers exploited to gain a foothold in target networks.  Nowadays, enterprises are using a plethora of security solutions to protect their network from cyber threats. The most prominent ones are Firewalls, IPS/IDS, SIEM, EDR, and XDR (which combines the functionality of EDR and SIEM). However, all these solutions suffer from security gaps that prevent them from stopping advanced cyber-attacks efficiently.&nbsp;  NDR was developed based on Intrusion Detection System (IDS). An IDS solution is installed on the network perimeter and monitors the network traffic for suspicious activities.  IDS systems suffer from many downsides that make them inefficient in stopping modern cyber-attacks: IDS use signature-based detection techniques to discover abnormal activities, making them unable to spot unknown attacks.  In addition, IDS systems trigger

[LIVE WEBINAR] How Lean Security Teams Can Improve Their Time to Response<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/live-webinar-how-lean-security-teams.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity could be described as a marathon for security teams that spend most of their time building sustained defenses that prevent threats day after day. However, they must be ready to hit a sprint whenever an attack succeeds since attack duration, and the resulting damages are directly correlated.&nbsp;  Reacting to a successful attack is a major challenge for lean security teams today since speed tends to be a result of size. Large teams with abundant resources can respond to incidents much faster as they can expend those resources freely. Lean security teams face the same costs and resource needs but with a much smaller pool to call from. A new live webinar by XDR provider Cynet shows why that doesn't have to be the case ( register here ).&nbsp;  The webinar breaks down how even large enterprises struggle with time to response. Look at any of the major breaches of the past years and you'll find large security teams that overlooked red flags or mishandled their incident response. It's n

One of the great resources available to businesses today is the large ecosystem of value-added services and solutions. Especially in technology solutions, there is no end to the services of which organizations can avail themselves.  In addition, if a business needs a particular solution or service they don't handle in-house, there is most likely a third-party vendor that can take care of that for them.  It is highly beneficial for businesses today to access these large pools of third-party resources. However, there can be security challenges for companies using third-party vendors and their services despite the benefits. Let's look at navigating vendor risk management as IT professionals and see how businesses can accomplish this in a highly complex cybersecurity world.  How can third-party vendors introduce cybersecurity risks?  As mentioned, third-party vendors can be highly beneficial to organizations doing business today.

Does a VPN Prevent Hacking?&nbsp;  You should definitely use a VPN on a public network or your home wi-fi because it significantly protects your privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Attackers are using many types of attacks to compromise business-critical data. These can include zero-day attacks, supply chain attacks, and others. However, one of the most common ways that hackers get into your environment is by compromising passwords.  The password spraying attack is a special kind of password attack that can prove effective in compromising your environment. Let's look closer at the password spraying attack and how organizations can prevent it.  Beware of compromised credentials  Are compromised credentials dangerous to your environment? Yes! Compromised credentials allow an attacker to "walk in the front door" of your environment with legitimate credentials. They assume all the rights and permissions to systems, data, and resources the compromised account can access.  The compromise of a privileged account is even worse. Privileged accounts are accounts that have high levels of access, such as an administrator user account. These types of accounts r

MSPs and MSSPs Can Increase Profit Margins With Cynet 360 Platform<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/06/msps-mssps-cybersecurity.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As cyber threats keep on increasing in volume and sophistication, more and more organizations acknowledge that outsourcing their security operations to a 3rd-party service provider is a practice that makes the most sense.  To address this demand, managed security services providers (MSSPs) and managed service providers (MSPs) continuously search for the right products that would empower their teams to deliver high-quality and scalable services.  Cynet 360 Autonomous Breach Protection platform offers a multitenant security solution for MSSP/MSP, providing automated, all-in-one products that include a robust SOAR layer, on top of attack prevention and detection. (Learn more about&nbsp; Cynet's partner program for MSPs and MSSPs &nbsp;here).  Service providers typically have a skilled security team at their disposal. The challenge is how to leverage this skill to serve as many customers as possible without compromising on the quality of the service. That makes each minute of each team member a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Among the problems stemming from our systemic failure with cybersecurity, which ranges from decades-old software-development practices to Chinese and Russian cyber-attacks, one problem gets far less attention than it should—the insider threat.  But the reality is that most organizations should be at least as worried about user management as they are about Bond villain-type hackers launching compromises from abroad.  Most organizations have deployed single sign-on and modern identity-management solutions. These generally allow easy on-boarding, user management, and off-boarding.  However, on mobile devices, these solutions have been less effective. Examples include mobile applications such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, or even SMS-which are common in the workforce.  All of these tools allow for low-friction, agile communication in an increasingly mobile business environment. Today, many of these tools offer end-to-end encryption (e2ee), which is a boon when viewed through the lens of

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Business email compromise (BEC) refers to all types of email attacks that do not have payloads. Although there are numerous types, there are essentially two main mechanisms through which attackers penetrate organizations utilizing BEC techniques, spoofing and account take-over attacks.  In a recent&nbsp; study , 71% of organizations acknowledged they had seen a business email compromise (BEC) attack during the past year. Forty-three percent of organizations experienced a security incident in the last 12 months, with 35% stating that BEC/phishing attacks account for more than 50% of the incidents.  The&nbsp; FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center &nbsp;(IC3) reports that BEC scams were the most expensive of cyberattacks in 2020, with 19,369 complaints and adjusted losses of approximately $1.8 billion. Recent BEC attacks include spoofing attacks on Shark Tank Host Barbara Corcoran, who lost&nbsp; $380,000 ; the Puerto Rican government attacks that amounted to $4 million, and Japanese media giant, Nikkei

There is a saying that goes something like, "Do not judge a book by its cover." Yet, we all know we can not help but do just that - especially when it comes to online security.  Logos play a significant role in whether or not we open an email and how we assess the importance of each message. Brand Indicators for Message Identification, or BIMI, aims to make it easier for us to quickly identify important information within emails using branding guidelines and visual cues found in logos.&nbsp;  In recent years, users are often unsure about the authenticity of emails, and this has become a major issue for businesses fighting spam. BIMI  gives email users access to information about a brand's identity. A company has complete control and freedom over what logo to attach to authenticated emails. Overall, BIMI acts as an additional layer of security to the existing email authentication process.  What is BIMI, and how does it strengthen the security of your emails?&nbsp;  BIMI is a standa

Kaseya Gets Universal Decryptor to Help REvil Ransomware Victims<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/kaseya-gets-universal-decryptor-to-help.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Nearly three weeks after Florida-based software vendor Kaseya was hit by a&nbsp; widespread supply-chain ransomware attack , the company on Thursday said it obtained a universal decryptor to unlock systems and help customers recover their data.   "On July 21, Kaseya obtained a decryptor for victims of the REvil ransomware attack, and we're working to remediate customers impacted by the incident," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. "Kaseya obtained the tool from a third-party and have teams actively helping customers affected by the ransomware to restore their environments, with no reports of any problem or issues associated with the decryptor."  It's not immediately unclear if Kaseya paid any ransom. It's worth noting that REvil affiliates had&nbsp; demanded a ransom of $70 million &nbsp;— an amount that was subsequently lowered to $50 million — but soon after, the ransomware gang mysteriously&nbsp; went off the grid , shutting down their payment sites and data leak portal

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Organizations today must give attention to their cybersecurity posture, including policies, procedures, and technical solutions for cybersecurity challenges.&nbsp;  This often results in a greater burden on the IT service desk staff as end-users encounter issues related to security software, policies, and password restrictions.&nbsp;  One of the most common areas where security may cause challenges for end-users is password policies and password changes. What are these issues? How can organizations reduce end-user password change frustration? First, let's consider the standard password policy, its role, and general settings affecting end-users.  What are password policies?  Most organizations today have a password policy in place. So, what is a password policy? Password policies define the types and content of passwords allowed or required of end-users in an identity and access management system. Various aspects of the password that businesses control may include the password's required

[eBook] A Guide to Stress-Free Cybersecurity for Lean IT Security Teams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/ebook-guide-to-stress-free.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Today's cybersecurity landscape is enough to make any security team concerned. The rapid evolution and increased danger of attack tactics have put even the largest corporations and governments at heightened risk. If the most elite security teams can't prevent these attacks from happening, what can lean security teams look forward to?&nbsp;  Surprisingly, leaner teams have a much greater chance than they think. It might seem counterintuitive, but recent history has shown that large numbers and huge budgets aren't the difference-makers they once were. Indeed, having the right strategy in place is a clear indicator of an organization's success today.  A new guide by XDR provider Cynet ( download it here ) looks to dispel the myth that bigger is always better and shows a smarter way forward for lean IT security teams.  The new guide focuses on helping lean IT security teams plan strategies that can protect their organizations while reducing the level of stress they face. Due to the rise of cyb

According to Keeper Security's Workplace Password Malpractice Report, many remote workers aren't following best practices for password security.

So, what happened post-pandemic?&nbsp; Keeper Security's Workplace Password Malpractice Report &nbsp;sought to find out.  In February 2021, Keeper surveyed 1,000 employees in the U.S. about their work-related password habits -- and discovered that a lot of remote workers are letting password security go by the wayside.  Here are 5 critical password security rules they're ignoring.  1 — Always use strong passwords  Strong passwords are at least eight characters long (preferably more) and consist of random strings of letters, numerals, and special characters. Passwords should never include dictionary words, which are easy to guess, or personal details, which cybercriminals can scrape off social media channels.   37% of respondents to Keeper's survey sai

Instagram earlier this week introduced a new " Security Checkup " feature that aims to keep accounts safe and help users—whose accounts may have been compromised—to recover them.  In order to gain access to accounts, users will be prompted to perform a series of steps, which include checking recent login activity, reviewing profile information, and updating contact details such as phone numbers or email.   Additionally, the Facebook-owned company is also "strongly" recommending users to turn on two-factor authentication for extra security and preventing unauthorized logins.   On that front, Instagram also said it would allow users in selected countries to use their WhatsApp numbers to authenticate their accounts.    Stressing that "Instagram will never send you a [direct message]," the social media platform cautioned users to be on the lookout for scams, wherein malicious accounts reach out via DMs to try and access sensitive information like account pass

Use This Definitive RFP Template to Effectively Evaluate XDR solutions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/07/extended-detection-response.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new class of security tools is emerging that promises to significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of threat detection and response.   Emerging Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solutions aim to aggregate and correlate telemetry from multiple detection controls and then synthesize response actions.   XDR has been referred to as the next step in the evolution of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.   In fact, Gartner named XDR as the first of their Top 9 Security and Risk Trend  for 2020.   Because XDR represents a new solution category, there is no single accepted definition of what capabilities and features should (and shouldn't) be included.   Each provider approaches XDR with different strengths and perspectives on how what an XDR solution should include.   Therefore, selecting an XDR provider is quite challenging as organizations must organize and prioritize a wide range of capabilities that can differ significantly between providers.   Cynet is now

Modern password policies are comprised of many different elements that contribute to its effectiveness. One of the components of an effective current password policy makes use of what is known as a&nbsp; custom dictionary&nbsp; that filters out certain words that are not allowed as passwords in the environment.  Using custom dictionaries, organizations can significantly improve their cybersecurity posture and filter out obvious passwords that provide poor security for user accounts.  When using password dictionaries in your password policy, there are many different approaches to consider. First, let's consider crafting a custom dictionary for your password policy, including general guidance on how these are created, configured, and how you can easily use custom dictionaries in an active directory environment.  Why customize your dictionary?&nbsp;  Custom dictionaries are born from the need to "think as a hacker thinks." Compromised credentials are one of the leading causes of malicious

For years, security professionals have recognized the need to enhance SaaS security. However, the exponential adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications over 2020 turned slow-burning embers into a raging fire.&nbsp;  Organizations manage anywhere from thirty-five to more than a hundred applications. From collaboration tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams to mission-critical applications like SAP and Salesforce, SaaS applications act as the foundation of the modern enterprise. 2020 created an urgent need for security solutions that mitigate SaaS misconfiguration risks.  Recognizing the importance of SaaS security, Gartner named a new category, SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM), to distinguish solutions that have the capabilities to offer a continuous assessment of security risks arising from a SaaS application's deployment.&nbsp;  To understand how security teams are currently dealing with their SaaS security posture and what their main concerns are, Adaptive Shield, a leading S

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security teams whose organizations are outside the Fortune 500 are faced with a dilemma. Most teams will have to choose between deploying either a network traffic analysis (NTA) or network detection and response (NDR) tool or an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool to supplement their existing stacks.  On the other hand, some organizations are getting the best of both options by switching to extended detection and response (XDR) tools which often provide all these tools in one solution.  This is the key takeaway of a new whitepaper by security provider Cynet ( download it here ).  NDR tools have become more popular, and for a good reason. They offer organizations a variety of benefits and can help further secure an environment from lateral movement attacks and further infiltration if an initial attack succeeds. NDR tools can detect a wide range of malicious activities and anomalous behaviors.&nbsp;  The question is whether the strengths of an NDR tool outweigh its limitations.&nbsp;  The

Securing applications it the API-first era can be an uphill battle. As development accelerates, accountability becomes unclear, and getting controls to operate becomes a challenge in itself. It's time that we rethink our application security strategies to reflect new priorities, principles and processes in the API-first era. Securing tomorrow's applications begins with assessing the business risks today.  The trends and risks shaping today's applications  As the world continues to become more and more interconnected via devices — and the APIs that connect them — individuals are growing accustomed to the frictionless experience that they provide. While this frictionless reality is doubtlessly more user-friendly, i.e., faster and more convenient, it also requires a trade-off. This convenience demands openness, and openness is a risk when it comes to cybersecurity.

The recent tsunami of ransomware has brought to life the fears of downtime and data loss cybersecurity pros have warned about, as attacks on the energy sector, food supply chain, healthcare industry, and other critical infrastructure have grabbed headlines.  For the industry experts who track the evolution of this threat, the increased frequency, sophistication, and destructiveness of ransomware suggests that businesses still have some major gaps in their defense strategies.  It's no surprise that a new, multi-layered approach to protection is needed to stem the damage caused by ransomware. But what changes should an IT team implement to close those gaps?  During a recent panel, a team of cybersecurity experts outlined a three-step plan to do just that -- centered around embracing new technologies, improving security processes, and ensuring their people know how to help curb the threat.  1&nbsp; —&nbsp; New Strains Overwhelm Old Defenses  Many new ransomware strains now act like advanced pe

Enterprise applications used to live securely in data centers and office employees connected to internal networks using company-managed laptops or desktops. And data was encircled by a walled perimeter to keep everything safe.  All that changed in the last 18 months. Businesses and employees had to adapt quickly to cloud technology and remote work. The cloud gave businesses the agility to respond faster to change and the scale to accommodate rapid growth. Remote work boosted productivity by letting employees access cloud data from anywhere on any device.  This is not business as usual. The data center and the perimeter security are no longer the center of the universe. Now remote workers, personal mobile devices, applications, and data are in the middle.  Although employees, applications, and data have left the building, IT security teams still shoulder the responsibility for protecting confidential data and ensuring compliance with strict privacy regulations. The risk of not doing so

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Controversial mogul and antivirus pioneer John McAfee on Wednesday died by suicide in a jail cell in Barcelona, hours after reports that he would be extradited to face federal charges in the U.S.  McAfee was 75. He is said to have died by hanging "as his nine months in prison brought him to despair," according to McAfee's lawyer Javier Villalba, Reuters&nbsp; reported . Security personnel at the Brians 2 prison tried to revive McAfee, but he was eventually declared dead, per&nbsp; Associated Press .   News of his death comes after Spain's National Court approved his extradition to the U.S. to face federal criminal tax evasion charges.  McAfee worked for NASA, Xerox, and Lockheed Martin before launching the world's first commercial antivirus software in 1987. He later resigned from the namesake security firm in 1994.   The former cybersecurity tycoon turned fugitive was detained in Spain last October for " willful failure to file tax returns ," with the U.S. Depar

It seems like every new day brings with it a new ransomware news item – new attacks, methods, horror stories, and data being leaked.  Ransomware attacks are on the rise, and they've become a major issue for organizations across industries. A recent report estimated that by 2031, ransomware attacks would cost the world over $260 billion.  A new whitepaper from XDR provider Cynet demonstrates how the company's platform can help organizations mitigate the impact of ransomware ( download here ).  Today, attackers have shown themselves to be less interested in ignoring the most vulnerable sectors, such as health care providers and hospitals. With a parallel increase in the number of variants – Wastedlocker, FTCode, Tycooon, TrickBot, REvil, and many others – it's becoming harder to defend against the growing threat of ransomware.  Ransomware operates by using a variety of infection and encryption techniques to steal or barricade companies' files behind hard paywalls. Even t

A wireless network naming bug has been discovered in Apple's iOS operating system that effectively disables an iPhone's ability to connect to a Wi-Fi network.  The issue was spotted by security researcher&nbsp; Carl Schou , who found that the phone's Wi-Fi functionality gets permanently disabled after joining a Wi-Fi network with the unusual name " %p%s%s%s%s%n " even after rebooting the phone or changing the network's name (i.e., service set identifier or SSID).   The bug could have serious implications in that bad actors could exploit the issue to plant fraudulent Wi-Fi hotspots with the name in question to break the device's wireless networking features.  After joining my personal WiFi with the SSID "%p%s%s%s%s%n", my iPhone permanently disabled it's WiFi functionality. Neither rebooting nor changing SSID fixes it :~) pic.twitter.com/2eue90JFu3 — Carl Schou (@vm_call) June 18, 2021   The issue stems from a&nbsp; string formatting &nbsp;bug in the manner iOS parses th

[eBook] 7 Signs You Might Need a New Detection and Response Tool<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/ebook-7-signs-you-might-need-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
It's natural to get complacent with the status quo when things seem to be working. The familiar is comfortable, and even if something better comes along, it brings with it many unknowns.  In cybersecurity, this tendency is countered by the fast pace of innovation and how quickly technology becomes obsolete, often overnight.  This combination usually results in one of two things – organizations make less than ideal choices about the software and tools they're adding, or security leaders simply cannot stay abreast of new developments and opt to stay put with their existing stack.  The problem is that once you let one update pass you by, you're suddenly miles behind. A new eBook from XDR provider Cynet ( download here ) offers insights into factors that are clear signs organizations need to upgrade their detection and response tools to stay with the times.  The eBook highlights several factors and questions that companies can ask themselves to determine whether they are okay

A solid password policy is the first line of defense for your corporate network. Protecting your systems from unauthorized users may sound easy on the surface, but it can actually be quite complicated. You have to balance password security with usability, while also following various regulatory requirements.  Companies in the EU must have password policies that are compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Even if your company isn't based in the EU, these requirements apply if you have employees or customers residing in the EU or customers purchasing there.  In this post, we will look at GDPR requirements for passwords and provide practical tips on how to design your password policy. Remember, even if GDPR isn't required for you now, the fundamentals of a data protection regulation plan can help strengthen your organization's security.&nbsp;  Password requirements for GDPR compliance  You may be surprised to discover that the GDPR laws do not actually mentio

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Organizations' cybersecurity capabilities have improved over the past decade, mostly out of necessity. As their defenses get better, so do the methods, tactics, and techniques malicious actors devise to penetrate their environments.  Instead of the standard virus or trojan, attackers today will deploy a variety of tools and methods to infiltrate an organization's environment and attack it from the inside.  In an interesting twist of fate, one of the tools organizations have used to audit and improve their defenses has also become a popular tool attackers use to infiltrate. Cobalt Strike is an Adversary Simulation and Red Team Operations tool that allows organizations to simulate advanced attacks and test their security stacks in a close-to-real-world simulation.  A new research webinar from XDR provider Cynet ( register here ) offers a better look at Cobalt Strike. The webinar, led by Cyber Operations Analyst for the Cynet MDR Team Yuval Fischer, will take a deep dive into the thr

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Bolstering password policies in your organization is an important part of a robust cybersecurity strategy. Cybercriminals are using compromised accounts as one of their favorite tactics to infiltrate business-critical environments; as we've seen in recent news, these attacks can be dangerous and financially impactful.  Unfortunately, account compromise is a very successful attack method and requires much less effort than other attack vectors.  One of the essential types of password protection recommended by noted cybersecurity standards is&nbsp; breached password detection . Hackers often use known breached password lists in credential stuffing or password spraying attacks.  Here are some critical criteria to consider when your sysadmins are evaluating breached password protection solutions.&nbsp;  Breached password recommendations  In the last few years, password security recommendations have evolved past the traditional recommendations regarding password security.&nbsp;  Businesses have used M

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The speed at which malicious actors have improved their attack tactics and continue to penetrate security systems has made going bigger the major trend in cybersecurity.  Facing an evolving threat landscape, organizations have responded by building bigger security stacks, adding more tools and platforms, and making their defenses more complex—a new eBook from XDR provider Cynet ( read it here ).  Organizations find themselves in a virtual arms race with malicious actors. Attackers find new, stealthier ways to penetrate an organization's defenses, and organizations build higher walls, buy more technologies to protect themselves, and expand their security stacks.  Money is a key component of security success – a tough reality for leaner organizations that might not have the seemingly endless budgets of larger corporations and enterprises.  The question of what leaner security teams could do about it used to be "not a lot," but today, that's hardly the case. Even though

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing cyber-espionage operation with suspected ties to China has been found targeting a Southeast Asian government to deploy spyware on Windows systems while staying under the radar for more than three years.  "In this campaign, the attackers utilized the set of Microsoft Office exploits and loaders with anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques to install a previously unknown backdoor on victim's machines," researchers from Check Point  Research said in a report published today.  The infection chain works by sending decoy documents, impersonating other entities within the government, to multiple members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which, when opened, retrieves a next-stage payload from the attacker's server that contains an encrypted downloader. The downloader, in turn, gathers and exfiltrates system information to a remote server that subsequently responds back with a shellcode loader.

The unfortunate truth is that while companies are investing more in cyber defenses and taking cybersecurity more seriously than ever, successful breaches and ransomware attacks are on the rise. While a successful breach is not inevitable, it is becoming more likely despite best efforts to prevent it from happening.&nbsp;  Just as it wasn't raining when Noah built the ark, companies must face the fact that they need to prepare - and educate the organization on - a well-thought-out response plan if a successful cyberattack does occur. Obviously, the worst time to plan your response to a cyberattack is when it happens.  With so many companies falling victim to cyberattacks, an entire cottage industry of Incident Response (IR) services has arisen.

Meanwhile, a new report concluded that injury rates at Amazon were nearly double those at other warehouses over the past few years, and a Defense Department report concluded that drones made by a Chinese group were not as much of a threat as some officials have feared.&nbsp;

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Are you aware of how secure your domain is? In most organizations, there is an assumption that their domains are secure and within a few months, but the truth soon dawns on them that it isn't.  Spotting someone spoofing your domain name is one way to determine if your security is unsatisfactory - this means that someone is impersonating you (or confusing some of your recipients) and releasing false information. You may ask, "But why should I care?" Because these spoofing activities can potentially endanger your reputation.  With so many companies being targeted by domain impersonators, email domain spoofing shouldn't be taken lightly. By doing so, they could put themselves, as well as their clients, at risk.&nbsp;  Your domain's security rating can make a huge difference in whether or not you get targeted by phishers looking to make money quickly or to use your domain and brand to spread ransomware without you knowing it!

Russian-language dark web marketplace Hydra has emerged as a hotspot for illicit activities, pulling in a whopping $1.37 billion worth of cryptocurrencies in 2020, up from $9.4 million in 2016.  The "blistering growth" in annual transaction volumes marks a staggering 624% year-over-year jump over a three-year period from 2018 to 2020.  "Further buoying Hydra's growth is its ability—or its good fortune—to remain running and unscathed against competitor attacks or&nbsp; law enforcement scrutiny ; its only downtime of note occurred during a short time period at the beginning of the COVID-19 global pandemic in late March 2020," threat intelligence firm Flashpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report jointly published with blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.

There is a person in every organization that is the direct owner of breach protection. His or her task is to oversee and govern the process of design, build, maintain, and continuously enhance the security level of the organization.   Title-wise, this person is most often either the CIO, CISO, or Directory of IT. For convenience, we'll refer to this individual as the CISO.   This person is the subject-matter expert in understanding the standard set of active cyber risks, benchmarking to what degree the organization's exposure influences potential impact. They then take appropriate steps to ensure the major risks are addressed.   On top of being engaged 24/7 in the organization's actual breach protection activity, the CISO has another critical task: to articulate the risks, potential impacts and appropriate steps to take to the company's management – or in other words, they must effectively translate security issues for non-security-savvy executives in a clear and busi

If there's one thing all great SaaS platforms share in common, it's their focus on simplifying the lives of their end-users. Removing friction for users in a safe way is the mission of single sign-on (SSO) providers.  With SSO at the helm, users don't have to remember separate passwords for each app or hide the digital copies of the credentials in plain sight.  SSO also frees up the IT's bandwidth from handling recurring password reset requests while improving productivity for everyone in your organization. However, there is also a level of risk that comes with SSO capability.&nbsp;  How to protect against SSO fails  Real-Life Risks Involved in SSO&nbsp;  While SSO facilitates ease of access to a great extent, it also comes with some amount of imminent risk.

A group of congressional Democrats on Tuesday called on Facebook to abandon a plan to create an Instagram for kids platform, further amplifying criticism of the plan. Meanwhile, advocates are expressing concerns that the “homework gap” created by digital learning during the COVID-19 pandemic may continue once students return to in-person classes, and Colonial Pipeline said it was experiencing some technical issues a week after service resumed after a devastating ransomware attack.&nbsp;

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Leaders in the InfoSec field face a strange dilemma. On the one hand, there are hundreds of thousands of resources available to find online to read (or watch) if they have questions – that's a benefit of a digital-first field. On the other hand, most leaders face challenges that – while not entirely unique each time – tend to require a specific touch or solution.  For most, it would be great to have a sympathetic ear or a fresh perspective that has faced similar challenges. Where does the tip of the spear turn to for a helping hand?  One popular avenue is to turn to a virtual CISO (or vCISO), an external consultant who can offer strategic advice, suggestions and help find insights that can be instrumental in building better security systems.  For many organizations, having the benefits of a CISO, even on a temporary basis, can be incredibly helpful and valuable.  With that in mind, Chris Roberts, Cynet's chief security strategist, is offering a new program ( you can learn more

Experts Reveal Over 150 Ways to Steal Control of 58 Android Stalkerware Apps<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/experts-reveal-over-150-ways-to-steal.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A total of 158 privacy and security issues have been identified in 58 Android stalkware apps from various vendors that could enable a malicious actor to take control of a victim's device, hijack a stalker's account, intercept data, achieve remote code execution, and even frame the victim by uploading fabricated evidence.  The new findings, which come from an analysis of 86 stalkerware apps for the Android platform undertaken by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, highlight the unintended consequences of a practice that's not only unethical but in the process could also expose private and intimate information of the victims and leave them at risk of cyberattacks and fraud.  "Since there could be a close relationship between stalker and victim, the stalker's private information could also be exposed," ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday write-up. "During our research, we identified that some stalkerware keeps information about the stalkers using

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In today's digital world, password security is more important than ever. While biometrics, one-time passwords (OTP), and other emerging forms of authentication are often touted as replacements to the traditional password, today, this concept is more marketing hype than anything else.  But just because&nbsp; passwords aren't going anywhere anytime soon &nbsp;doesn't mean that organizations don't need to modernize their approach to password hygiene right now.&nbsp;  The Compromised Credential Crisis  As Microsoft's&nbsp; security team put it , "All it takes is one compromised credential…to cause a data breach." Coupled with the rampant problem of password reuse, compromised passwords can have a significant and long-lasting impact on enterprise security.  In fact, researchers from Virginia Tech University found that over 70% of users employed a compromised password for other accounts up to a year after it was initially leaked, with 40% reusing passwords that were leaked over three years ago.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A worker at Amazon’s Bessemer, Ala. facility dropped a big allegation about security guards having access to a mailbox during the unionization election at a National Labor Relations Board hearing Friday. Meanwhile, Facebook lost a bid to block an Irish watchdog's draft decision that could suspend the tech giant’s ability to transfer data from the U.S. to the EU, and bipartisan groups of House lawmakers rolled out two pieces of legislation to protect critical infrastructure against cyberattacks following the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline.&nbsp;

Report to Your Management with the Definitive 'Incident Response for Management' Presentation Template<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2019/10/cybersecurity-incident-response.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security incidents occur. It's not a matter of 'if' but of 'when.' There are security products and procedures that were implemented to optimize the IR process, so from the 'security-professional' angle, things are taken care of.   However, many security pros who are doing an excellent job in handling incidents find effectively communicating the ongoing process with their management a much more challenging task.   It's a little surprise — managements are typically not security savvy and don't really care about the bits and bytes in which the security pro masters. Cynet addresses this gap with the IR Reporting for Management PPT template , providing CISOs and CIOs with a clear and intuitive tool to report both the ongoing IR process and its conclusion.   The IR for Management template enables CISOs and CIOs to communicate with the two key points that management cares about—assurance that the incident is under control and a clear understanding of imp

Big Cybersecurity Tips For Remote Workers Who Use Their Own Tech<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/big-cybersecurity-tips-for-remote.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the total number of people working from home has grown dramatically in the last year or two, so has the number of individuals who use all of their own technology for their jobs. If you're a remote worker who relies on your own PC to get your work done, then you may be at a heightened risk for some of the major threats that are impacting the computer industry as a whole.  Relatively few people take all of the recommended precautions when using their own technology. While it's unlikely that people are engaged in any riskier behaviors than they were before, the fact that few people have the time to follow all the relevant pieces of cybersecurity news means some people might be unaware of certain active threats. That may explain how a password manager was&nbsp; used to install malicious code &nbsp;on a large number of client machines.  Though you might not want to follow all of the news that comes out about security issues on a daily basis, you might find it helpful to pay close attentio

Can Data Protection Systems Prevent Data At Rest Leakage?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/can-data-protection-systems-prevent.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Protection against insider risks works when the process involves controlling the data transfer channels or examining data sources.  One approach involves preventing USB flash drives from being copied or sending them over email. The second one concerns preventing leakage or fraud in which an insider accesses files or databases with harmful intentions.  What's the best way to protect your data?  It seems obvious that prevention is the best way to solve any problem. In most cases, DCAP (data-centric audit and protection) and DAM (database activity monitoring) is sufficient. Both serve the purpose of protecting data at rest.  The following example illustrates the approach we found in the Russian legal system.  An employee of the Federal Migration Service in one of the Russian regions was approached by his friend, who asked him to hide information about two offenses in his file in the migrant database. The employee knew that this could be done remotely, accessed the database from home,

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The concept of automation has taken on a life of its own in recent years. The idea is nothing new, but the current interest in automation is a mix of both hype and innovation.  On the one hand, it's much easier today to automate everything from small processes to massive-scale tasks than it's ever been before. On the other hand, are we really prepared to hand the reins over to completely automated systems, and should we?  There are areas in security operations where automation is already a critical component. In terms of analytics and parsing through ever-expanding data flows, it's impossible for most teams to keep up without impacting other areas of their jobs. Automated systems help us make sense of threats much faster and more reliably. However, automation isn't a cure-all (just yet). A new live webinar from XDR provider Cynet dives into the topic more in depth ( register here ).  The webinar explores automation as it exists today in the cybersecurity industry. Led

The nation’s oil and gas sector was left reeling from a ransomware attack late last week that caused Colonial Pipeline to shut down operations that provide around 45 percent of the East Coast’s oil. Officials and experts said Monday that the hack underscored vulnerabilities in the nation’s critical utilities, while the Biden administration launched a “whole-of-government” response to address the crisis. Meanwhile, a group of attorneys general urged Facebook to abandon support for an Instagram for kids platform.&nbsp;

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For as long as corporate IT has been in existence, users have been required to change their passwords periodically. In fact, the need for scheduled password changes may be one of the most long-standing of all IT best practices.  Recently, however, things have started to change. Microsoft has reversed course on the best practices that it has had in place for decades and&nbsp; no longer recommends that organizations require users to change passwords periodically . Organizations are being forced to consider, perhaps for the first time, whether or not requiring periodic password changes is a good idea.  Microsoft password reset recommendations  According to Microsoft, requiring users to change their passwords frequently does more harm than good.&nbsp;  Humans are notoriously resistant to change. When a user is forced to change their password, they will often come up with a new password that is based on their previous password. A user might, for example, append a number to the end of their password

InfoSec leaders tend to be a specific type. Their jobs require them to think of possible threats, take actions that may not pay immediate results, plan for unknown security risks, and react quickly when emergencies arise, often before the morning's first coffee.  The high-stakes position also means that CISOs need to keep their knowledge and skills sharp – you can never really know what's around the corner.  So, what can security leaders do to make sure they're prepared and hone their skills ahead of the next inevitable threat? Now, they can test themselves and their knowledge at a new website, 'The CISO Challenge' ( visit it here ). The website, launched by XDR provider Cynet, aims to let information security leaders test their cybersecurity mettle.

Sure, helpdesk technicians do plenty of other things too, but in many organizations, a disproportionate number of helpdesk calls are tied to password resets.  On the surface, having a&nbsp; helpdesk technician reset a user's password &nbsp;probably doesn't seem like a big deal. After all, the technician simply opens Active Directory Users and Computers, right-clicks on the user account, and chooses the Reset Password command from the shortcut menu. Resetting a password in this way is an easy process. Organizations can even opt to use an alternative tool such as the Windows Admin Center or even PowerShell if they prefer.  One thing that most people probably don't stop and think about, however, is that even though the steps involved in the password reset process are simple enough, the&nbsp; process as a whole constitutes a major security risk .

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Perhaps due to the nature of the position, the InfoSec leadership roles tend to be solitary ones. CISOs, or their equivalent decision-makers in organizations without the role, have so many constant drains on their attention – keeping their knowledge fresh, building plans to secure their organizations further – that they often find themselves on an island.  It's even more challenging for organizations outside the Fortune 2000 that are resource-constrained.  Security leaders are expected to know everything and often don't have anyone inside their organization with whom to bounce ideas or even go to for advice. When a crisis arises, they must often go with their gut or guess at the best solution based on their own experiences.  Security leaders could often use advice but don't have an outlet for it. Chris Roberts, Chief Security Strategist at Cynet Security, offers a new Slack-based community for InfoSec leaders ( register here ) as a solution.  The new InfoSec Leaders Community will fea

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The release of MITRE Engenuity's Carbanak+Fin7 ATT&amp;CK evaluations every year is a benchmark for the cybersecurity industry.  The organization's tests measure how well security vendors can detect and respond to threats and offers an independent metric for customers and security leaders to understand how well vendors perform on a variety of tasks.  However, for the uninitiated, the results can be hard to decipher and contextualize properly. Unlike many benchmarks that compare participants in a competitive manner, MITRE's framework evaluates companies exclusively on how they respond to the tests.  This means that customers must really know what they're looking for. A new webinar ( register here ) aims to provide some clarity on what to look for and how to interpret the results.&nbsp;  Cynet's new live webinar will dig a little deeper into the MITRE ATT&amp;CK evaluation.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
There are many labor-intensive tasks that the IT service desk carries out on a daily basis. None as tedious and costly as resetting passwords.  Modern IT service desks spend a significant amount of time both unlocking and resetting passwords for end-users. This issue has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Causes of account lockouts and password resets  End-user password policies, such as those found in Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS), typically define a&nbsp; password age . The password age is the length of time an end-user can keep their current password.  While&nbsp; new guidance from NIST &nbsp;recommends against the long-held notion of forced password changes, it is still a common and required security mechanism across other compliance standards and industry certifications such as PCI and HITRUST.  When the password age is reached for the user account, the user must change their account password. It is generally prompted at the next login on their workstation. This sce

Today there are plenty of cybersecurity tools on the market. It is now more important than ever that the tools you decide to use work well together.

[eBook] Why Autonomous XDR Is Going to Replace NGAV/EDR<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/ebook-why-autonomous-xdr-is-going-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For most organizations today, endpoint protection is the primary security concern. This is not unreasonable – endpoints tend to be the weakest points in an environment – but it also misses the forest for the trees. As threat surfaces expand, security professionals are harder pressed to detect threats that target other parts of an environment and can easily miss a real vulnerability by focusing too hard on endpoints.  This is why pairing tools such as next-generation antivirus (NGAV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) has become a popular, if flawed, choice. Fortunately, newer technologies and security methods offer much greater prevention and detection capabilities. This is the key argument of a new eBook ( download here ) offered by XDR provider Cynet.  The eBook, titled&nbsp; Why Autonomous XDR is Going to Replace NGAV/EDR,&nbsp; starts with a look at how NGAV and EDR tools can defend an organization with the "assume breach" mentality – expecting a breach to occur and protecting endpoi

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The concept of "passwordless" authentication has been gaining significant industry and media attention. And for a good reason. Our digital lives are demanding an ever-increasing number of online accounts and services, with security best practices dictating that each requires a strong, unique password in order to ensure data stays safe. Who wouldn't want an easier way?  That's the premise behind one-time passwords (OTP), biometrics, pin codes, and other authentication methods presented as passwordless security. Rather than remembering cumbersome passwords, users can authenticate themselves using something they own, know, or are. Some examples include a smartphone, OTP, hardware token, or biometric marker like a fingerprint. While this sounds appealing on the surface, the problem is that, when you dig deeper, these passwordless solutions are still reliant on passwords.  This happens in two primary ways:  Passwordless Solutions Rely on Passwords as a Fallback  If you ha

Simplify, then Add Lightness – Consolidating the Technology to Better Defend Ourselves<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/simplify-then-add-lightness.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
One of the biggest consequences of the rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat landscape is that defenses must constantly build bigger systems to defend themselves.&nbsp;  This leads to both more complex systems and often less communication between them. More importantly, it can lead companies to invest in disparate "best in class" components instead of finding the best fit for their needs.  The constant arms race means that companies often get bigger, more powerful tools that can't handle the nuanced threats they face. For instance, in a car race, it's not often the fastest, most powerful car that wins, but the one that is more balanced, lighter, and more able to turn and react when needed.  In a new live webinar, Cynet Chief Strategist Chris Roberts breaks down why the philosophy of "simpler is better" is just what cybersecurity needs ( register here ).  The webinar will focus on how quickly cybersecurity stacks are growing and how this is not always a good thing. Companies are too focused

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The SolarWinds attack , which succeeded by utilizing the sunburst malware , shocked the cyber-security industry. This attack achieved persistence and was able to evade internal systems long enough to gain access to the source code of the victim.  Because of the far-reaching SolarWinds deployments, the perpetrators were also able to infiltrate many other organizations, looking for intellectual property and other assets.  Among the co-victims: US government, government contractors, Information Technology companies, and NGOs. Terabytes of data of 18,000 customers was stolen after a trojan-ized version of the SolarWinds application was installed in the internal structures of the clients.  Looking at the technical capabilities of the malware, as you will see, this particular attack was quite impressive. A particular file, named&nbsp; SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll &nbsp;is a SolarWinds digitally signed component of the Orion software framework.  The threat actors installed a backdoor that c

Behind the strategies and solutions needed to counter today's cyber threats are—dedicated cybersecurity researchers. They spend their lives dissecting code and analyzing incident reports to discover how to stop the bad guys.&nbsp;  But what drives these specialists? To understand the motivations for why these cybersecurity pros do what they do, we decided to talk with cybersecurity analysts from around the world.  To get viewpoints from across Europe, Asia, and the Americas, we recently spoke with a team of researchers from Acronis' global network of Cyber Protection Operations Centers (CPOCs):&nbsp; Candid Wüest , VP of Cyber Protection Research who is based in Switzerland;&nbsp; Alexander Ivanyuk , Senior Director, Product, and Technology Positioning, who is based in Singapore; and two Cybersecurity Analysts,&nbsp; Topher Tebow &nbsp;and&nbsp; Blake Collins , who are both based in the U.S.  The conversation yielded some interesting insights into their views of the world, how they approach cyber threat an

The number of threats targeting cloud services, predominantly collaboration services like Office 365, has&nbsp; increased 630% .

Meanwhile, political ads will once again be allowed on Facebook after an extended pause in the wake of the deadly Capitol riot. And Parler is not giving up.

Let's first take a look back at 2020!  Adding to the list of difficulties that surfaced last year, 2020 was also grim for personal data protection, as it has marked a new record number of leaked credentials and PI data.  A whopping 20 billion records were stolen in a single year, increasing 66% from 12 billion in 2019.

This trend seems to fit an exponential curve; even worse, we are yet to see the fallouts from the end of the year "Solorigate" campaign, which has the potential to marginalize even these numbers by the end of 2021.  Found among the leaked data are usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, bank account details, healthcare information, and other personal data.

In the era of hacking and malicious actors, a company's cloud security posture is a concern that preoccupies most, if not all, organizations.  Yet even more than that, it is the SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) that is critical to today's company security. Recently Malwarebytes released a statement on how they were targeted by Nation-State Actors implicated in SolarWinds breach. Their investigation suggested abuse of privileged access to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure environments.  Often left unsecured, it's SaaS setting errors like misconfigurations, inadequate legacy protocols, insufficient identity checks, credential access, and key management that leave companies open to account hijacking, insider threats, and other types of leaks or breaches in the organization.&nbsp;  Gartner has defined &nbsp;the SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) category in 2020's Gartner Hype Cycle for Cloud Security as solutions that continuously assess the security risk and manage SaaS a

Guide: How Security Consolidation Helps Small Cybersecurity Teams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/guide-how-security-consolidation-helps.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The dynamic nature of cybersecurity, the changes in the threat landscape, and the expansion of the attack surface lead organizations to add more security solutions—from different vendors—creating a layered security infrastructure that introduces new challenges to any team, with a much more significant impact on small ones.  And yet, sophisticated attacks continue to bypass these advanced security layers while FOMO (fear of missing out) compels security teams to evaluate every new solution that comes out.  A new guide, "How Security Consolidation Helps Small Security Teams" ( download here ), reviews the challenges of a layered, multi-vendor security approach for protecting your internal environment and reveals why the concept of consolidation of security solutions is becoming the go-to security approach of many CISOs with small teams.  Having a single consolidated solution for protecting your internal environment can free up much of your small team's time and reduce your

Security Operations is a 24 x 7 job. It does not stop for weekends or holidays or even that much-needed coffee break after the first hour of the shift is complete. We all know this.  Every SOC engineer is hoping for some rest at some point. One of my favorite jokes when talking about Security Operations is "3 SOC engineers walked into a bar…" That the joke. No SOC engineers have time to do that. They get it. They laugh. So why is this all true?  Let us explore that a little bit.   Demand for experienced SOC engineers far surpasses the available talent.  Event volume levels boggle the imagination compared to even just a few years ago.  Utilization of tools to their utmost capability has often not been a priority.&nbsp;   In the Security Operations space, we have been using SIEM's for many years with varying degrees of deployments, customization, and effectiveness. For the most part, they have been a helpful tool for Security Operations. But they can be better. Like any tool, t

The pressure on small to medium-sized enterprises to protect their organizations against cyberthreats is astronomical. These businesses face the same threats as the largest enterprises, experience the same (relative) damages and consequences when breaches occur as the largest enterprises but are forced to protect their organizations with a fraction of the resources as the largest enterprises.&nbsp;  Cybersecurity company Cynet just released findings from a survey of 200 CISOs in charge of small security teams ( Download here ) to shine "a spotlight into the challenges of small security teams everywhere."  In addition to better understanding the challenges these CISOs face, the 2021 Survey of CISOs with Small Security Teams delves into the strategies CISOs will employ to ensure their organizations are protected from the ongoing onslaught of cyber threats - all while saddled with limited budgets and headcount.

With so much of the world transitioning to working, shopping, studying, and streaming online during the coronavirus pandemic, cybercriminals now have access to a larger base of potential victims than ever before.  "Zoombomb" &nbsp;became the new photobomb—hackers would gain access to a private meeting or online class hosted on Zoom and shout&nbsp; profanities and racial slurs &nbsp;or flash&nbsp; pornographic images . Nation-state hacker groups mounted attacks against organizations involved in the coronavirus pandemic response, including the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some in an attempt to politicize the pandemic.  Even garden-variety cyber attacks like email phishing, social engineering, and refund theft took on a darker flavor in response to the widespread economic precarity brought on by the pandemic.&nbsp;  "Hackers were mostly trying to take advantage of people's fear by offering medical equipment like thermometers and masks for cheap, low

In the Wake of the SolarWinds Hack, Here's How Businesses Should Respond<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/in-wake-of-solarwinds-hack-heres-how.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Throughout 2020, businesses, in general, have had their hands full with IT challenges. They had to rush to accommodate a sudden shift to remote work. Then they had to navigate a rapid adoption of automation technologies.  And as the year came to a close, more businesses began trying to assemble the safety infrastructure required to return to some semblance of normal in 2021.  But at the end of the year,&nbsp; news of a massive breach &nbsp;of IT monitoring software vendor SolarWinds introduced a new complication – the possibility of a wave of secondary data breaches and cyber-attacks. And because SolarWinds' products have a presence in so many business networks, the size of the threat is massive.  So far, though, most of the attention is getting paid to large enterprises like Microsoft and Cisco (and the US Government), who were the primary target of the SolarWinds breach. What nobody's talking about is the rest of the 18,000 or so SolarWinds clients who may have been affected. For them

Most companies with small security teams face the same issues. They have inadequate budgets, inadequate staff, and inadequate skills to face today's onslaught of sophisticated cyberthreats.  Many of these companies turn to virtual CISOs (vCISOs) to provide security expertise and guidance. vCISOs are typically former CISOs with years of experience building and managing information security programs across large and small organizations.  Autonomous XDR company Cynet, a provider of an automated breach protection platform and MDR service for even the smallest security teams, is conducting a webinar with well-known vCISO Brian Haugli to understand the common challenges faced by CISOs with small security teams [ register here ].  In the first part of the webinar, Haugli will share the four foundational risks that are common across most companies he helps.

Enhancing Email Security with MTA-STS and SMTP TLS Reporting<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/enhancing-email-security-with-mta-sts.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In 1982, when SMTP was first specified, it did not contain any mechanism for providing security at the transport level to secure communications between mail transfer agents.  Later, in 1999, the STARTTLS command was added to SMTP that in turn supported the encryption of emails in between the servers, providing the ability to convert a non-secure connection into a secure one that is encrypted using TLS protocol.  However, encryption is optional in SMTP, which implies that emails can be sent in plaintext.&nbsp; Mail Transfer Agent-Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) &nbsp;is a relatively new standard that enables mail service providers the ability to enforce Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure SMTP connections and to specify whether the sending SMTP servers should refuse to deliver emails to MX hosts that that does not offer TLS with a reliable server certificate. It has been proven to successfully mitigate TLS downgrade attacks and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.  SMTP TLS Reporting (TLS-

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Over the years,&nbsp; penetration testing &nbsp;has had to change and adapt alongside the IT environments and technology that need to be assessed.  Broad cybersecurity issues often influence the strategy and growth of pen-testing. In such a fast-paced field, organizations get real value from learning about others' penetration testing experiences, identifying trends, and the role they play in today's threat landscape.  While there is much to be gained from a single snapshot, additional value can come from long term data collection and year over year comparisons. We can see whether the effects that recent trends have on pen testing are long term, or simply a temporary shift, and how they affect the continuing evolution of penetration testing. For instance, 2020 saw a massive influx of remote work.  Unfortunately, the convenience of working safely from home increased the risk of a breach as countless new attack vectors opened up, both from the way employees connected to networks, as well a

Like it or not, 2020 was the year that proved that teams could work from literally anywhere.  While terms like "flex work" and "WFH" were thrown around before COVID-19 came around, thanks to the pandemic, remote working has become the defacto way people work nowadays. Today, digital-based work interactions take the place of in-person ones with near-seamless fluidity, and the best part is that going remote helps companies save their cash in this bootstrapped time.&nbsp;  But while the ability to work from anywhere has truly been essential to keeping businesses and the economy functional, it has opened up new challenges that need to be addressed.&nbsp;  Your Devices Are Your Weakest Link  With nearly ⅔ of employees still working remotely to some degree, the boundaries that once separated work and home have been completely washed away.

End-user passwords are one of the weakest components of your overall security protocols. Most users tend to reuse passwords across work and personal accounts.  They may also choose relatively weak passwords that satisfy company password policies but can be easily guessed or brute-forced. Your users may also inadvertently use&nbsp; breached passwords &nbsp;for their corporate account password.  The&nbsp; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) &nbsp;has a cybersecurity framework that helps organizations address common cybersecurity pitfalls in their environment, including weak, reused, and breached passwords. This post will take a closer look at the NIST password guidelines and see how you can effectively audit your password policies to ensure these meet the standards recommended by NIST.  NIST Password Guidelines and Best Practices  Specific guidance around passwords is addressed within the chapter titled&nbsp; Memorized Secret Verifiers .
