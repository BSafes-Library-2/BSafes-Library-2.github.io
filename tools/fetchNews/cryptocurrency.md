Researchers 'Accidentally' Crash KmsdBot Cryptocurrency Mining Botnet Network<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/12/researchers-accidentally-crashed.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing analysis into an up-and-coming cryptocurrency mining botnet known as&nbsp; KmsdBot &nbsp;has led to it being accidentally taken down.  KmsdBot, as christened by the Akamai Security Intelligence Response Team (SIRT), came to light mid-November 2022 for its ability to&nbsp; brute-force systems &nbsp;with weak SSH credentials.  The botnet strikes both Windows and Linux devices spanning a wide range of microarchitectures with the primary goal of deploying mining software and corralling the compromised hosts into a DDoS bot.   Some of the major targets included gaming firms, technology companies, and luxury car manufacturers.  Akamai researcher Larry W. Cashdollar, in a new update, explained how commands sent to the bot to understand its functionality in a controlled environment inadvertently neutralized the malware.   "Interestingly, after one single improperly formatted command, the bot stopped sending commands," Cashdollar&nbsp; said . "It's not every day you come across a botnet t

U.S. Authorities Seize Domains Used in 'Pig butchering' Cryptocurrency Scams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/us-authorities-seize-domains-used-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) on Monday&nbsp; announced &nbsp;the takedown of seven domain names in connection to a "pig butchering" cryptocurrency scam. The fraudulent scheme, which operated from May to August 2022, netted the actors over $10 million from five victims, the DoJ said.  Pig butchering, also called Sha Zhu Pan, is a type of scam in which swindlers lure unsuspecting investors into sending their crypto assets. The criminals encounter potential victims on dating apps, social media sites, and SMS messages.  These individuals initiate fake relationships in an attempt to build trust, only to trick them into making a cryptocurrency investment on a bogus platform.   "Once the money is sent to the fake investment app, the scammer vanishes, taking all the money with them, often resulting in significant losses for the victim," the DoJ said.  The seven seized portals all mimicked the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX), the agency pointed out.  But once t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly discovered evasive malware leverages the Secure Shell ( SSH ) cryptographic protocol to gain entry into targeted systems with the goal of mining cryptocurrency and carrying out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.  Dubbed&nbsp; KmsdBot &nbsp;by the Akamai Security Intelligence Response Team (SIRT), the Golang-based malware has been found targeting a variety of companies ranging from gaming to luxury car brands to security firms.  "The botnet infects systems via an SSH connection that uses weak login credentials," Akamai researcher Larry W. Cashdollar&nbsp; said . "The malware does not stay persistent on the infected system as a way of evading detection."   The malware gets its name from an executable named "kmsd.exe" that's downloaded from a remote server following a successful compromise. It's also designed to support multiple architectures, such as Winx86, Arm64, mips64, and x86_64.  KmsdBot comes with capabilities to perform scanning operatio

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Monday said it seized 50,676 Bitcoin in November 2021 that was stolen in the 2012 hack of the now-defunct Silk Road dark web marketplace.  The bitcoin, which was obtained in 2012 and valued at $3.36 billion when it was discovered last year, is now worth $1.04 billion. Additionally recovered were $661,900 in cash, 25 Casascius coins with an approximate value of 174 Bitcoin, and gold- and silver-colored bars.  It's also one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures to date, followed by the confiscation of $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin&nbsp; earlier this February &nbsp;tied to the 2016 breach of the Bitfinex crypto exchange.   The Justice Department said it conducted the seizure on November 9, 2021, pursuant to a search warrant issued to James Zhong's house located in the U.S. state of Georgia. It also said the keys to the tokens were found in an underground floor safe and on a "single-board computer that was submerged under blankets in a popcorn t

New Cryptojacking Campaign Targeting Vulnerable Docker and Kubernetes Instances<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/new-cryptojacking-campaign-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new cryptojacking campaign has been uncovered targeting vulnerable Docker and Kubernetes infrastructures as part of opportunistic attacks designed to illicitly mine cryptocurrency.  Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike dubbed the activity&nbsp; Kiss-a-dog , with its command-and-control infrastructure overlapping with those associated with other groups like&nbsp; TeamTNT , which are known to&nbsp; strike &nbsp; misconfigured &nbsp;Docker and Kubernetes instances.  The intrusions, spotted in September 2022, get their name from a domain named "kiss.a-dog[.]top" that's used to trigger a shell script payload on the compromised container using a Base64-encoded Python command.   "The URL used in the payload is obscured with backslashes to defeat automated decoding and regex matching to retrieve the malicious domain," CrowdStrike researcher Manoj Ahuje&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical analysis.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Both cryptocurrency and ransomware are nothing new in the digital world; both have been there for a very long time, which was enough for them to find common pieces for starting their relationship.  Ransomware can be like a virtual car that works on all types of fuels, and crypto is the one that is currently most recommended. No one can argue that 2020 was the year of ransomware in the cyber world, but it wasn't due to the fact that cybercriminals chose ransomware just because they knew how to attack properly. It's because of the fact that crypto rose mostly this year, along with the new normal of the digital world. It gave them a new cause to stick to ransomware, thanks to the anonymous payments that can be made using a cryptocurrency.&nbsp;  How does ransomware work?&nbsp;  Ransomware is a malware type that encrypts the victim's files, whether it's a random user or an organization, leading to denying them access to those files on their personal devices.

Don't let the ongoing " crypto winter " lull you into a false sense of cybersecurity. Even as&nbsp; cryptocurrencies lose value &nbsp;— and some crypto companies&nbsp; file for bankruptcy &nbsp;—&nbsp; cryptojacking &nbsp;still poses an urgent threat to enterprises across industries, from financial services to healthcare to industry 4.0 and beyond.&nbsp;  Broadly speaking, cryptojacking is defined as the unauthorized and illegitimate use of an unwitting party's compute and/or server power by a malicious actor to mine cryptocurrencies. While everyone with an internet connection is technically vulnerable to cryptojacking, most attacks target enterprises with significant compute resources, especially those with an outsized number of third-party relationships. (More on that last part in a bit.) And if a malicious actor can breach your cybersecurity defenses for cryptojacking purposes, they can breach them for any number of nefarious reasons.&nbsp;  Under normal conditions, mining for cryptocurrency is hugely expensive because d

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors such as Kinsing are taking advantage of both recently disclosed and older security flaws in Oracle WebLogic Server to deliver cryptocurrency-mining malware.  Cybersecurity company Trend Micro said it&nbsp; found &nbsp;the financially-motivated group leveraging the vulnerability to drop Python scripts with capabilities to disable operating system (OS) security features such as Security-Enhanced Linux ( SELinux ), and others.  The operators behind the&nbsp; Kinsing malware &nbsp;have a history of scanning for vulnerable servers to co-opt them into a botnet, including that of&nbsp; Redis ,&nbsp; SaltStack ,&nbsp; Log4Shell ,&nbsp; Spring4Shell , and the Atlassian Confluence flaw ( CVE-2022-26134 ).   The Kinsing actors have also been involved in campaigns against container environments via&nbsp; misconfigured open Docker Daemon API ports &nbsp;to launch a crypto miner and subsequently spread the malware to other containers and hosts.  The latest wave of attacks entails the actor weaponizing&nbsp; CVE-2020-14882 &nbsp;(CVSS score:

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Turkish-speaking entity called Nitrokod  has been attributed to an active cryptocurrency mining campaign that involves impersonating a desktop application for Google Translate to infect over 111,000 victims in 11 countries since 2019.&nbsp;  "The malicious tools can be used by anyone," Maya Horowitz, vice president of research at Check Point, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. "They can be found by a simple web search, downloaded from a link, and installation is a simple double-click."  The list of countries with victims includes the U.K., the U.S., Sri Lanka, Greece, Israel, Germany, Turkey, Cyprus, Australia, Mongolia, and Poland.   The&nbsp; campaign &nbsp;entails serving malware through free software hosted on popular sites such as Softpedia and Uptodown. But in an interesting tactic, the malware puts off its execution for weeks and separates its malicious activity from the downloaded fake software to avoid detection.

As many as 207 websites have been infected with malicious code designed to launch a cryptocurrency miner by leveraging WebAssembly (Wasm) on the browser.  Web security company Sucuri, which published details of the campaign, said it launched an investigation after one of its clients had their computer slowed down significantly every time upon navigating to their own WordPress portal.  This uncovered a compromise of a theme file to inject malicious JavaScript code from a remote server -- hxxps://wm.bmwebm[.]org/auto.js -- that's loaded whenever the website's page is accessed.  "Once decoded, the contents of auto.js immediately reveal the functionality of a cryptominer which starts mining when a visitor lands on the compromised site," Sucuri malware researcher Cesar Anjos&nbsp; said .  What's more, the deobfuscated auto.js code makes use of WebAssembly to run low-level binary code directly on the browser.   WebAssembly , which is supported by all major browsers, is a&nbsp; b

GitHub Actions and Azure virtual machines (VMs) are being leveraged for cloud-based cryptocurrency mining, indicating sustained attempts on the part of malicious actors to target cloud resources for illicit purposes.

Critical Bug in Everscale Wallet Could've Let Attackers Steal Cryptocurrencies<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/critical-bug-in-everscale-wallet.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security vulnerability has been disclosed in the web version of the Ever Surf  wallet that, if successfully weaponized, could allow an attacker to gain full control over a victim's wallet.  "By exploiting the vulnerability, it's possible to decrypt the private keys and seed phrases that are stored in the browser's local storage," Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "In other words, attackers could gain full control over the victim's wallets."   Ever Surf &nbsp;is a cryptocurrency wallet for the Everscale (formerly FreeTON) blockchain that also doubles up as a cross-platform messenger and allows users to access decentralized apps as well as send and receive non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It's said to have an&nbsp; estimated &nbsp;669,700 accounts across the world.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
LemonDuck, a cross-platform cryptocurrency mining botnet, is targeting Docker to mine cryptocurrency on Linux systems as part of an active malware campaign.  "It runs an anonymous mining operation by the use of proxy pools, which hide the wallet addresses," CrowdStrike&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "It evades detection by targeting Alibaba Cloud's monitoring service and disabling it."  Known to strike both Windows and Linux environments, LemonDuck is primarily engineered for abusing the system resources to mine Monero. But it's also capable of credential theft, lateral movement, and facilitating the deployment of additional payloads for follow-on activities.  "It uses a wide range of spreading mechanisms — phishing emails, exploits, USB devices, brute force, among others — and it has shown that it can quickly take advantage of news, events, or the release of new exploits to run effective campaigns," Microsoft&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;in a technical write-up of the ma

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a now-fixed security flaw in the Rarible non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace that, if successfully exploited, could have led to account takeover and theft of cryptocurrency assets.   "By luring victims to click on a malicious NFT, an attacker can take full control of the victim's crypto wallet to steal funds," Check Point researchers Roman Zaikin, Dikla Barda, and Oded Vanunu&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.   Rarible, an NFT marketplace that enables users to create, buy, and sell digital NFT art like photographs, games, and memes, has over 2.1 million active users.   "There is still a huge gap between, in terms of security, between Web2 and Web3 infrastructure," Vanunu, head of products vulnerabilities research at Check Point, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.

Researchers have blown the lid off a sophisticated malicious scheme primarily targeting Chinese users via copycat apps on Android and iOS that mimic legitimate digital wallet services to siphon cryptocurrency funds.

The wallet services are said to have been distributed through a network of over 40 counterfeit wallet websites that are promoted with the help of misleading articles posted on legitimate Chinese websites, as well as by means of recruiting intermediaries through Telegram and Facebook groups, in an attempt to trick unsuspecting visitors into downloading the malicious apps.

An ongoing crypto mining campaign has upgraded its arsenal while adding new defense evasion tactics that enable the threat actors to conceal the intrusions and fly under the radar, new research published today has revealed.  Since first detected in 2019, a total of 84 attacks against its honeypot servers have been recorded to date, four of which transpired in 2021, according to researchers from DevSecOps and cloud security firm Aqua Security, who have been tracking the malware operation for the past three years. That said, 125 attacks have been spotted in the wild in the third quarter of 2021 alone, signaling that the attacks have not slowed down.  Initial attacks involved executing a malicious command upon running a vanilla image named "alpine:latest" that resulted in the download of a shell script named "autom.sh."

Warning: Yet Another Bitcoin Mining Malware Targeting QNAP NAS Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/warning-yet-another-bitcoin-mining.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Network-attached storage (NAS) appliance maker QNAP on Tuesday released a new advisory warning of a cryptocurrency mining malware targeting its devices, urging customers to take preventive steps with immediate effect.  "A bitcoin miner has been reported to target QNAP NAS. Once a NAS is infected, CPU usage becomes unusually high where a process named '[oom_reaper]' could occupy around 50% of the total CPU usage," the Taiwanese company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert. "This process mimics a kernel process but its [process identifier] is usually greater than 1000."   QNAP said it's currently investigating the infections, but did not share more information on the initial access vector that's being used to compromise the NAS devices. Affected users can remove the malware by restarting the appliances.  In the interim, the company is recommending that users update their QTS (and QuTS Hero) operating systems to the latest version, enforce strong passwords for administr

Malicious KMSPico Windows Activator Stealing Users' Cryptocurrency Wallets<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/malicious-kmspico-windows-activator.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Users looking to activate Windows without using a digital license or a product key are being targeted by tainted installers to deploy malware designed to plunder credentials and other information in cryptocurrency wallets.  The malware, dubbed " CryptBot ," is an information stealer capable of obtaining credentials for browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, browser cookies, credit cards, and capturing screenshots from the infected systems. Deployed via cracked software, the latest attack involves the malware masquerading as KMSPico.   KMSPico is an unofficial tool that's used to illicitly&nbsp; activate &nbsp;the full features of pirated copies of software such as Microsoft Windows and Office suite without actually owning a license key.   "The user becomes infected by clicking one of the malicious links and downloading either KMSPico, Cryptbot, or another malware without KMSPico," Red Canary researcher Tony Lambert&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.

A sixth member associated with an international hacking group known as&nbsp; The Community &nbsp;has been sentenced in connection with a multimillion-dollar SIM swapping conspiracy, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said.  Garrett Endicott, 22, from the U.S. state of Missouri, who pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft following an indictment in 2019, was&nbsp; sentenced &nbsp;to 10 months in prison and ordered to pay an amount totaling $121,549.37 in restitution.   SIM swapping , also called SIM hijacking, refers to an identity theft scheme wherein malicious parties persuade phone carriers into porting their victims' cell services to SIM cards under their control, often facilitated by bribing an employee of a mobile phone provider or by contacting the service provider's customer support by posing as the victim and requesting that the phone number be swapped to a SIM card operated by the group.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Three JavaScript libraries uploaded to the official NPM package repository have been unmasked as crypto-mining malware, once again demonstrating how open-source software package repositories are becoming a lucrative target for executing an array of attacks on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.  The malicious packages in question — named&nbsp; okhsa ,&nbsp; klow , and&nbsp; klown &nbsp;— were published by the same developer and falsely claimed to be JavaScript-based user-agent string parsers designed to extract hardware specifics from the " User-Agent " HTTP header. But unbeknownst to the victims who imported them, the author hid cryptocurrency mining malware inside the libraries.   The bad actor's NPM account has since been deactivated, and all the three libraries, each of which were downloaded 112, 4, and 65 times respectively, have been removed from the repository as of October 15, 2021.  Attacks involving the three libraries worked by detecting the current operating system, before procee

A threat group likely based in Romania and active since at least 2020 has been behind an active cryptojacking campaign targeting Linux-based machines with a previously undocumented SSH brute-forcer written in Golang.  Dubbed " Diicot brute ," the password cracking tool is alleged to be distributed via a software-as-a-service model, with each threat actor furnishing their own unique API keys to facilitate the intrusions, Bitdefender researchers said in a report published last week.   While the goal of the campaign is to deploy Monero mining malware by remotely compromising the devices via brute-force attacks, the researchers connected the gang to at least two&nbsp; DDoS &nbsp;botnets, including a&nbsp; Demonbot &nbsp;variant called chernobyl and a Perl&nbsp; IRC bot , with the XMRig mining payload hosted on a domain named mexalz[.]us since February 2021.
