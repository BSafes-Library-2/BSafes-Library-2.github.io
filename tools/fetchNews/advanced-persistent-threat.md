The U.S. government on Wednesday warned of nation-state actors deploying specialized malware to maintain access to industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) devices.  "The APT actors have developed custom-made tools for targeting ICS/SCADA devices," multiple U.S. agencies&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert. "The tools enable them to scan for, compromise, and control affected devices once they have established initial access to the operational technology (OT) network."  The joint federal advisory comes courtesy of the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  The custom-made tools are specifically designed to single out Schneider Electric programmable logic controllers (PLCs), OMRON Sysmac NEX PLCs, and Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers.

Chinese APT Hackers Targeting Betting Companies in Southeast Asia<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/chinese-apt-hackers-targeting-betting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese-speaking advanced persistent threat (APT) has been linked to a new campaign targeting gambling-related companies in South East Asia, particularly Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong.  Cybersecurity firm Avast dubbed the campaign&nbsp; Operation Dragon Castling , describing its malware arsenal as a "robust and modular toolset." The ultimate motives of the threat actor are not immediately discernible as yet nor has it been linked to a known hacking group.   While multiple initial access avenues were employed during the course of the campaign, one of the attack vectors involved leveraging a previously unknown remote code execution flaw in the WPS Office suite ( CVE-2022-24934 ) to backdoor its targets. The issue has since been addressed by Kingsoft Oﬃce, the developers of the office software.   In the case observed by the Czech security firm, the vulnerability was used to drop a malicious binary from a fake update server with the domain update.wps[.]cn that triggers a m

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New findings released last week showcase the overlapping source code and techniques between the operators of&nbsp; Shamoon &nbsp;and&nbsp; Kwampirs , indicating that they "are the same group or really close collaborators."  "Research evidence shows identification of co-evolution between both Shamoon and Kwampirs malware families during the known timeline," Pablo Rincón Crespo of Cylera Labs&nbsp; said .  "If Kwampirs is based on the original Shamoon, and Shamoon 2 and 3 campaign code is based on Kwampirs, […] then the authors of Kwampirs would be potentially the same as the authors of Shamoon, or must have a very strong relationship, as has been seen over the course of many years," Rincón Crespo added.  Shamoon, also known as DistTrack, functions as an information-stealing malware that also incorporates a destructive component that allows it to overwrite the Master Boot Record (MBR) with arbitrary data so as to render the infected machine inoperable.

Threat hunters have shed light on the tactics, techniques, and procedures embraced by an Indian-origin hacking group called Patchwork as part of a renewed campaign that commenced in late November 2021, targeting Pakistani government entities and individuals with a research focus on molecular medicine and biological science.  "Ironically, all the information we gathered was possible thanks to the threat actor infecting themselves with their own [remote access trojan], resulting in captured keystrokes and screenshots of their own computer and virtual machines," Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published on Friday.  Prominent victims that were successfully infiltrated include Pakistan's Ministry of Defense, National Defence University of Islamabad, Faculty of Bio-Sciences at UVAS Lahore, International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), H.E.J.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A never-before-seen China-based targeted intrusion adversary dubbed Aquatic Panda has been observed leveraging&nbsp; critical flaws &nbsp;in the Apache Log4j logging library as an access vector to perform various post-exploitation operations, including reconnaissance and credential harvesting on targeted systems.  Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said the infiltration, which was ultimately foiled, was aimed at an unnamed "large academic institution." The state-sponsored group is believed to have been operating since mid-2020 in pursuit of intelligence collection and industrial espionage, with its attacks primarily directed against companies in the telecommunications, technology, and government sectors.   The attempted intrusion exploited the newly discovered&nbsp; Log4Shell &nbsp;flaw (CVE-2021-44228, CVSS score: 10.0) to gain access to a vulnerable instance of the&nbsp; VMware Horizon &nbsp;desktop and app virtualization product, followed by running a series of malicious commands orchestrated to fetch thr

APT C-23 Hackers Using New Android Spyware Variant to Target Middle East Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/apt-c-23-hackers-using-new-android.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor known for striking targets in the Middle East has evolved its Android spyware yet again with enhanced capabilities that allow it to be stealthier and more persistent while passing off as seemingly innocuous app updates to stay under the radar.  The new variants have "incorporated new features into their malicious apps that make them more resilient to actions by users, who might try to remove them manually, and to security and web hosting companies that attempt to block access to, or shut down, their command-and-control server domains," Sophos threat researcher Pankaj Kohli&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday.   Also known by the monikers&nbsp; VAMP ,&nbsp; FrozenCell ,&nbsp; GnatSpy , and&nbsp; Desert Scorpion , the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with&nbsp; successive iterations &nbsp;featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, r

Russian Turla APT Group Deploying New Backdoor on Targeted Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/russian-turla-apt-group-deploying-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
State-sponsored hackers affiliated with Russia are behind a new series of intrusions using a previously undocumented implant to compromise systems in the U.S., Germany, and Afghanistan.  Cisco Talos attributed the attacks to the&nbsp; Turla &nbsp;advanced persistent threat (APT) group, coining the malware "TinyTurla" for its limited functionality and efficient coding style that allows it to go undetected. Attacks incorporating the backdoor are believed to have occurred since 2020.   "This simple backdoor is likely used as a second-chance backdoor to maintain access to the system, even if the primary malware is removed," the researchers&nbsp; said . "It could also be used as a second-stage dropper to infect the system with additional malware." Furthermore, TinyTurla can upload and execute files or exfiltrate sensitive data from the infected machine to a remote server, while also polling the command-and-control (C2) station every five seconds for any new commands.

A New APT Hacker Group Spying On Hotels and Governments Worldwide<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/a-new-apt-hacker-group-spying-on-hotels.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new advanced persistent threat (APT) has been behind a string of attacks against hotels across the world, along with governments, international organizations, engineering companies, and law firms.  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET codenamed the cyber espionage group&nbsp; FamousSparrow , which it said has been active since at least August 2019, with victims located across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas, spanning several countries such as Burkina Faso, Taiwan, France, Lithuania, the U.K., Israel, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Canada, and Guatemala.   Attacks mounted by the group involve exploiting known vulnerabilities in server applications such as SharePoint and Oracle Opera, in addition to the&nbsp; ProxyLogon &nbsp;remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server that came to light in March 2021, making it the&nbsp; latest threat actor &nbsp;to have had access to the exploit before details of the flaw became public.   According to ESET, intrusion exploiting the flaws commen

A new highly capable and persistent threat actor has been targeting major high-profile public and private entities in the U.S. as part of a series of targeted cyber intrusion attacks by exploiting internet-facing Microsoft Internet Information Services ( IIS ) servers to infiltrate their networks.  Israeli cybersecurity firm Sygnia, which identified the campaign, is tracking the advanced, stealthy adversary under the moniker "Praying Mantis" or "TG2021."

The toolset is completely volatile, reflectively loaded into an affected machine's memory and leaves little-to-no trace on infected targets," the researchers&nbsp; said .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor has been tracked in a new campaign deploying Android malware via the Syrian e-Government Web Portal, indicating an upgraded arsenal designed to compromise victims.  "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the group has been publicly observed using malicious Android applications as part of its attacks," Trend Micro researchers Zhengyu Dong, Fyodor Yarochkin, and Steven Du&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published Wednesday.  StrongPity , also codenamed&nbsp; Promethium &nbsp;by Microsoft, is believed to have been active since 2012 and has typically focused on targets across Turkey and Syria. In June 2020, the espionage threat actor was&nbsp; connected &nbsp;to a wave of activities that banked on watering hole attacks and tampered installers, which abuse the popularity of legitimate applications, to infect targets with malware.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Advanced Persistent Threats groups were once considered a problem that concerns Fortune 100 companies only. However, the threat landscape of the recent years tells otherwise—in fact, every organization, regardless of vertical and size is at risk, whether as a direct target, supply chain or collateral damage.   The vast majority of security decision-makers acknowledge they need to address the APT risk with additional security solutions but struggle with mapping APT attack vectors to a clear-cut set of security product capabilities, which impairs their ability to choose the products that would best protect them.   Cynet is now addressing this need with the definitive RFP templates for EDR/EPP and APT Protection , an expert-made security requirement list, that enables stakeholders to accelerate and optimize the evaluation process of the products they evaluate.   These RFP templates aim to capture the widest common denominator in terms of security needs and deliver the essential that are

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious campaign that has set its sights on industrial-related entities in the Middle East since 2019 has resurfaced with an upgraded malware toolset to strike both Windows and macOS operating systems, symbolizing an expansion in both its targets and its strategy around distributing threats.  Russian cybersecurity firm attributed the attacks to an advanced persistent threat (APT) it tracks as " WildPressure ," with victims believed to be in the oil and gas industry.&nbsp;  WildPressure first came to light in March 2020 based off of a malware operation distributing a fully-featured C++ Trojan dubbed "Milum" that enabled the threat actor to gain remote control of the compromised device. The attacks were said to have begun as early as August 2019.   "For their campaign infrastructure, the operators used rented OVH and Netzbetrieb virtual private servers (VPS) and a domain registered with the Domains by Proxy anonymization service," Kaspersky researcher Denis

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are warning of ongoing attacks coordinated by a suspected Chinese-speaking threat actor targeting the Afghanistan government as part of an espionage campaign that may have had its provenance as far back as 2014.  Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point Research attributed the intrusions to a hacking group tracked under the moniker "IndigoZebra," with past activity aimed at other central-Asian countries, including Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.  "The threat actors behind the espionage leveraged Dropbox, the popular cloud-storage service, to infiltrate the Afghan National Security Council (NSC)," the researchers said in a technical write-up  shared with The Hacker News, adding they "orchestrated a ministry-to-ministry style deception, where an email is sent to a high-profile target from the mailboxes of another high-profile victim."   IndigoZebra first came to light in August 2017 when Kaspersky&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;a covert operation that single

A spear-phishing attack operated by a North Korean threat actor targeting its southern counterpart has been found to conceal its malicious code within a bitmap (.BMP) image file to drop a remote access trojan (RAT) capable of stealing sensitive information.  Attributing the attack to the&nbsp; Lazarus Group &nbsp;based on similarities to prior tactics adopted by the adversary, researchers from Malwarebytes said the phishing campaign started by distributing emails laced with a malicious document that it identified on April 13.   "The actor has used a clever method to bypass security mechanisms in which it has embedded its malicious&nbsp; HTA &nbsp;file as a compressed&nbsp; zlib &nbsp;file within a PNG file that then has been decompressed during run time by converting itself to the BMP format," Malwarebytes researchers&nbsp; said .&nbsp;  "The dropped payload was a loader that decoded and decrypted the second stage payload into memory.

Cryptocurrency miners are typically associated with cybercriminal operations, not sophisticated nation state actor activity. They are not the most sophisticated type of threats, which also means that they are not among the most critical security issues that defenders address with urgency. Recent campaigns from the nation-state actor BISMUTH take advantage of the low-priority alerts coin miners cause to try and fly under the radar and establish persistence.
