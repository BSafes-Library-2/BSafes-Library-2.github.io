The U.S. government on Wednesday said the Chinese state-sponsored hacking group known as&nbsp; Volt Typhoon &nbsp;had been embedded into some critical infrastructure networks in the country for at least five years. Targets of the threat actor include communications, energy, transportation, and water and wastewater systems sectors in the U.S. and Guam. "Volt Typhoon's choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering operations, and the U.S. authoring agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable lateral movement to OT assets to disrupt functions," the U.S. government&nbsp; said . The joint advisory, which was released by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), was also backed by other nations that are part of the Five Eyes (FVEY) intelligence all

Details of the issue&nbsp; first came to light &nbsp;in April 2023, with Horizon3.ai's Naveen Sunkavally describing it as a "dangerous default configuration in Apache Superset that allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain remote code execution, harvest credentials, and compromise data." It's currently not known how the vulnerability is being exploited in the wild. Also added by CISA are five other flaws - CVE-2023-38203 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8) - Adobe ColdFusion Deserialization of Untrusted Data Vulnerability CVE-2023-29300 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8) - Adobe ColdFusion Deserialization of Untrus

NIST Warns of Security and Privacy Risks from Rapid AI System Deployment<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/01/nist-warns-of-security-and-privacy.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is calling attention to the&nbsp; privacy and security challenges &nbsp;that arise as a result of increased deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in recent years. "These security and privacy challenges include the potential for adversarial manipulation of training data, adversarial exploitation of model vulnerabilities to adversely affect the performance of the AI system, and even malicious manipulations, modifications or mere interaction with models to exfiltrate sensitive information about people represented in the data, about the model itself, or proprietary enterprise data," NIST&nbsp; said . As AI systems become integrated into online services at a rapid pace, in part driven by the emergence of generative AI systems like OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard, models powering these technologies face a number of threats at various stages of the machine learning operations. These include corrupted training data, security flaw

The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has warned of a new phishing campaign orchestrated by the&nbsp; Russia-linked&nbsp;APT28&nbsp;group &nbsp;to deploy previously undocumented malware such as OCEANMAP, MASEPIE, and STEELHOOK to harvest sensitive information. The activity, which was&nbsp; detected &nbsp;by the agency between December 15 and 25, 2023, targets government entities with email messages urging recipients to click on a link to view a document. However, to the contrary, the links redirect to malicious web resources that abuse JavaScript and the&nbsp; "search-ms:" URI protocol handler &nbsp;to drop a Windows shortcut file (LNK) that launches PowerShell commands to activate an infection chain for a new malware known as MASEPIE. MASEPIE is a Python-based tool to download/upload files and execute commands, with communications with the command-and-control (C2) server taking place over an encrypted channel using the TCP protocol.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned of active exploitation of a&nbsp; high-severity Adobe ColdFusion vulnerability &nbsp;by unidentified threat actors to gain initial access to government servers. "The vulnerability in ColdFusion (CVE-2023-26360) presents as an improper access control issue and exploitation of this CVE can result in arbitrary code execution," CISA&nbsp; said , adding an unnamed federal agency was targeted between June and July 2023. The shortcoming affects ColdFusion 2018 (Update 15 and earlier versions) and ColdFusion 2021 (Update 5 and earlier versions). It has been addressed in versions Update 16 and Update 6, released on March 14, 2023, respectively. It was added by CISA to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog a day later, citing evidence of active exploitation in the wild. Adobe, in an advisory released around that time, said it's aware of the flaw being "exploited in the wild in very limited attacks."

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is adopting new rules that aim to protect consumers from cell phone account scams that make it possible for malicious actors to orchestrate SIM-swapping attacks and port-out fraud. "The rules will help protect consumers from scammers who target data and personal information by covertly swapping SIM cards to a new device or porting phone numbers to a new carrier without ever gaining physical control of a consumer's phone," FCC&nbsp; said &nbsp;this week. While SIM swapping refers to transferring a user's account to a SIM card controlled by the scammer by convincing the victim's wireless carrier,&nbsp; port-out fraud &nbsp;occurs when the bad actor, posing as the victim, transfers their phone number from one service provider to another without their knowledge. The new rules,&nbsp; first proposed in July 2023 , mandate wireless providers to adopt secure methods of authenticating a customer before redirecting a customer's phone number to a new device or provide

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The AvosLocker ransomware gang has been linked to attacks against critical infrastructure sectors in the U.S., with some of them detected as recently as May 2023. That's according to a new joint cybersecurity advisory released by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) detailing the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). "AvosLocker affiliates compromise organizations' networks by using legitimate software and open-source remote system administration tools," the agencies&nbsp; said . "AvosLocker affiliates then use exfiltration-based data extortion tactics with threats of leaking and/or publishing stolen data." The ransomware strain&nbsp; first emerged &nbsp;on the scene in mid-2021, and has since leveraged sophisticated techniques to disable antivirus protection as a detection evasion measure. It affects Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi environment

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning of a new trend of dual ransomware attacks targeting the same victims, at least since July 2023. "During these attacks, cyber threat actors deployed two different ransomware variants against victim companies from the following variants: AvosLocker, Diamond, Hive, Karakurt, LockBit, Quantum, and Royal," the FBI&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert. "Variants were deployed in various combinations." Not much is known about the scale of such attacks, although it's believed that they happen in close proximity to one another, ranging from anywhere between 48 hours to within 10 days. Another notable change observed in ransomware attacks is the increased use of custom data theft, wiper tools, and malware to exert pressure on victims to pay up. "This use of dual ransomware variants resulted in a combination of data encryption, exfiltration, and financial losses from ransom payments," the agency said. "Second ran

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Tuesday warned that threat actors affiliated with North Korea may attempt to cash out stolen cryptocurrency worth more than $40 million. The law enforcement agency&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the blockchain activity to an adversary the U.S. government tracks as TraderTraitor, which is also known by the name Jade Sleet. An investigation undertaken by the FBI found that the group moved approximately 1,580 bitcoin from several cryptocurrency heists over the past 24 hours and are currently said to be holding those funds in six different wallets. North Korea is known to blur the lines among cyber warfare, espionage, and financial crime.&nbsp; TraderTraitor , in particular, has been linked to a series of attacks targeting blockchain and cryptocurrency exchanges with the goal of plundering digital assets to generate illicit revenue for the sanctions-hit nation. This includes the $60 million theft of virtual currency from Alphapo on June 22, 2023; the $37 m

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical security flaw in Citrix ShareFile storage zones controller to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, based on evidence of active in-the-wild exploitation. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-24489 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the shortcoming has been described as an improper access control bug that, if successfully exploited, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to compromise vulnerable instances remotely. The problem is rooted in ShareFile's handling of cryptographic operations, enabling adversaries to upload arbitrary files, resulting in remote code execution. "This vulnerability affects all currently supported versions of customer-managed ShareFile storage zones controller before version 5.11.24," Citrix&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory released in June. Dylan Pindur of Assetnote has been credited with discovering and reporting the issue. It's worth noting that the&nbsp; first signs of exploitatio

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning about cyber crooks masquerading as legitimate non-fungible token (NFT) developers to steal cryptocurrency and other digital assets from unsuspecting users. In these fraudulent schemes, criminals either obtain direct access to NFT developer social media accounts or create look-alike accounts to promote "exclusive" new NFT releases, often employing misleading advertising campaigns that create a sense of urgency to pull them off. "Links provided in these announcements are phishing links directing victims to a spoofed website that appears to be a legitimate extension of a particular NFT project," the FBI&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory last week. The replica websites urge potential targets to connect their cryptocurrency wallets and purchase the NFT, only for the threat actors to siphon the funds and NFTs to wallets under their control.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A four-year-old critical security flaw impacting Fortinet FortiOS SSL has emerged as one of the most routinely and frequently exploited vulnerabilities in 2022. "In 2022, malicious cyber actors exploited older software vulnerabilities more frequently than recently disclosed vulnerabilities and targeted unpatched, internet-facing systems," cybersecurity and intelligence agencies from the Five Eyes nations, which comprises Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S.,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a joint alert. The continued weaponization of&nbsp; CVE-2018-13379 , which was also one among the most exploited bugs in&nbsp; 2020 &nbsp;and&nbsp; 2021 , suggests a failure on the part of organizations to apply patches in a timely manner, the authorities said. "Malicious cyber actors likely prioritize developing exploits for severe and globally prevalent CVEs," according to the advisory.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday disclosed details of a "novel persistent backdoor" called&nbsp; SUBMARINE &nbsp;deployed by threat actors in connection with the hack on Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances. "SUBMARINE comprises multiple artifacts — including a SQL trigger, shell scripts, and a loaded library for a Linux daemon — that together enable execution with root privileges, persistence, command and control, and cleanup," the agency&nbsp; said . The findings come from an analysis of malware samples obtained from an unnamed organization that had been compromised by threat actors exploiting a critical flaw in ESG devices,&nbsp; CVE-2023-2868 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), which allows for remote command injection. Evidence gathered so far shows that the attackers behind the activity, a suspected China nexus-actor tracked by Mandiant as&nbsp; UNC4841 , leveraged the flaw as a zero-day in October 2022 to gain initial access to victim envir

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity agencies in Australia and the U.S. have&nbsp; published &nbsp;a joint cybersecurity advisory warning against security flaws in web applications that could be exploited by malicious actors to orchestrate data breach incidents and steal confidential data. This includes a specific class of bugs called Insecure Direct Object Reference ( IDOR ), a type of access control flaw that occurs when an application utilizes user-supplied input or an identifier for direct access to an internal resource, such as a database record, without any additional validations. A&nbsp; typical example &nbsp;of an IDOR flaw is the ability of a user to trivially change the URL (e.g., https://example[.]site/details.php?id= 12345 ) to obtain unauthorized data of another transaction (i.e., https://example[.]site/details.php?id= 67890 ).

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an advisory on Thursday warning that the newly disclosed critical security flaw in Citrix NetScaler Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Gateway devices is being abused to drop web shells on vulnerable systems. "In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day to drop a web shell on a critical infrastructure organization's non-production environment NetScaler ADC appliance," the agency&nbsp; said . "The web shell enabled the actors to perform discovery on the victim's active directory (AD) and collect and exfiltrate AD data. The actors attempted to move laterally to a domain controller but network segmentation controls for the appliance blocked movement." The shortcoming in question is&nbsp; CVE-2023-3519 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), a code injection bug that could result in unauthenticated remote code execution.

U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have&nbsp; released &nbsp;a set of recommendations to address security concerns with 5G standalone network slicing and harden them against possible threats.

Network slicing is an architectural model that allows mobile service providers to partition their network up into several independent "slices" in order to create virtual networks that cater to different clients and use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Swedish data protection watchdog has warned companies against using Google Analytics due to risks posed by U.S. government surveillance, following similar moves by&nbsp; Austria, France , and&nbsp; Italy &nbsp;last year. The development comes in the aftermath of an audit initiated by the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) against four companies CDON, Coop, Dagens Industri, and Tele2. "In its audits, IMY considers that the data transferred to the U.S. via Google's statistics tool is personal data because the data can be linked with other unique data that is transferred," IMY&nbsp; said . "The authority also concludes that the technical security measures that the companies have taken are not sufficient to ensure a level of protection that essentially corresponds to that guaranteed within the EU/EEA." The data protection authority also fined $1.1 million for Swedish telecom service provider Tele2 and less than $30,000 for local online marketplace CDON failing to

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has&nbsp; added &nbsp;a batch of six flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. This comprises three vulnerabilities that Apple patched this week ( CVE-2023-32434, CVE-2023-32435, and CVE-2023-32439 ), two flaws in VMware ( CVE-2023-20867 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-20887 ), and one shortcoming impacting Zyxel devices ( CVE-2023-27992 ). CVE-2023-32434 and CVE-2023-32435, both of which allow code execution, are said to have been exploited as zero-days to deploy spyware as part of a years-long cyber espionage campaign that commenced in 2019. Dubbed Operation Triangulation, the activity culminates in the deployment of&nbsp; TriangleDB &nbsp;that's designed to harvest a wide range of information from compromised devices, such as creating, modifying, removing, and stealing files, listing and terminating processes, gathering credentials from iCloud Keychain, and tracking a user's location.

NSA Releases Guide to Combat Powerful BlackLotus Bootkit Targeting Windows Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/nsa-releases-guide-to-combat-powerful.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) on Thursday released guidance to help organizations detect and prevent infections of a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) bootkit called&nbsp; BlackLotus . To that end, the agency is&nbsp; recommending &nbsp;that "infrastructure owners take action by hardening user executable policies and monitoring the integrity of the boot partition." BlackLotus is an&nbsp; advanced &nbsp;crimeware solution that was first spotlighted in October 2022 by Kaspersky. A UEFI bootkit capable of bypassing Windows Secure Boot protections, samples of the malware have since emerged in the wild. This is accomplished by taking advantage of a known Windows flaw called Baton Drop ( CVE-2022-21894 , CVSS score: 4.4) discovered in vulnerable&nbsp; boot loaders &nbsp;not added into the&nbsp; Secure Boot DBX revocation list . The vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft in January 2022. This loophole could be exploited by threat actors to replace fully patched boot loaders with vulnerable v

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have published a joint advisory regarding the active exploitation of a&nbsp; recently disclosed critical flaw &nbsp;in Progress Software's MOVEit Transfer application to drop ransomware.

"Internet-facing MOVEit Transfer web applications were infected with a web shell named LEMURLOOT, which was then used to steal data from underlying MOVEit Transfer databases." The prolific cybercrime gang has since&nbsp; issued an ultimatum &nbsp;to several impacted businesses, urging them to get in touch by June 14, 2023, or risk getting all their stolen data published.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has released an Industrial Control Systems (ICS) medical advisory warning of a critical flaw impacting Illumina medical devices. The issues impact the Universal Copy Service (UCS) software in the Illumina MiSeqDx, NextSeq 550Dx, iScan, iSeq 100, MiniSeq, MiSeq, NextSeq 500, NextSeq 550, NextSeq 1000/2000, and NovaSeq 6000 DNA sequencing instruments. The most severe of the flaws, CVE-2023-1968 (CVSS score: 10.0), permits remote attackers to bind to exposed IP addresses, thereby making it possible to eavesdrop on network traffic and remotely transmit arbitrary commands. The second issue relates to a case of privilege misconfiguration (CVE-2023-1966, CVSS score: 7.4) that could enable a remote unauthenticated malicious actor to upload and execute code with elevated permissions. "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to take any action at the operating system level," CISA&nbsp; sa

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; published &nbsp; eight &nbsp;Industrial Control Systems (ICS) advisories warning of critical flaws affecting products from Hitachi Energy, mySCADA Technologies, Industrial Control Links, and Nexx. Topping the list is&nbsp; CVE-2022-3682 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.9), impacting Hitachi Energy's MicroSCADA System Data Manager SDM600 that could allow an attacker to take remote control of the product. The flaw stems from an issue with file permission validation, thereby permitting an adversary to upload a specially crafted message to the system, leading to arbitrary code execution. Hitachi Energy has released SDM600 1.3.0.1339 to&nbsp; mitigate &nbsp;the issue for SDM600 versions prior to version 1.2 FP3 HF4 (Build Nr. 1.2.23000.291). Another set of five critical vulnerabilities –&nbsp; CVE-2023-28400 ,&nbsp; CVE-2023-28716 ,&nbsp; CVE-2023-28384 ,&nbsp; CVE-2023-29169 , and&nbsp; CVE-2023-29150 &nbsp;(CVSS scores: 9.9) – relate to command injection bugs present in mySCADA my

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday&nbsp; signed an executive order &nbsp;that restricts the use of commercial spyware by federal government agencies. The order said the spyware ecosystem "poses significant counterintelligence or security risks to the United States Government or significant risks of improper use by a foreign government or foreign person." It also seeks to ensure that the government's use of such tools is done in a manner that's "consistent with respect for the rule of law, human rights, and democratic norms and values." To that end, the order lays out the various criteria under which commercial spyware could be disqualified for use by U.S. government agencies. They include - The purchase of commercial spyware by a foreign government or person to target the U.S. government, A commercial spyware vendor that uses or discloses sensitive data obtained from the cyber surveillance tool without authorization and operates under the control of a foreign g

CISA Alerts on Critical Security Vulnerabilities in Industrial Control Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/cisa-alerts-on-critical-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has released eight Industrial Control Systems (ICS)&nbsp; advisories &nbsp;on Tuesday, warning of critical flaws affecting equipment from Delta Electronics and Rockwell Automation. This includes 13 security vulnerabilities in Delta Electronics' InfraSuite Device Master, a real-time device monitoring software. All versions prior to 1.0.5 are affected by the issues. "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to obtain access to files and credentials, escalate privileges, and remotely execute arbitrary code," CISA&nbsp; said . Top of the list is&nbsp; CVE-2023-1133 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), a critical flaw that arises from the fact that InfraSuite Device Master accepts unverified UDP packets and&nbsp; deserializes the content , thereby allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. Two other deserialization flaws,&nbsp; CVE-2023-1139 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8) and&nbsp; CVE-2023-1145

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; released &nbsp;a new advisory about&nbsp; Royal ransomware , which emerged in the threat landscape last year. "After gaining access to victims' networks, Royal actors disable antivirus software and exfiltrate large amounts of data before ultimately deploying the ransomware and encrypting the systems," CISA&nbsp; said . The custom&nbsp; ransomware program , which has targeted U.S. and international organizations since September 2022, is believed to have evolved from earlier iterations that were dubbed Zeon.&nbsp; What's more, it's said to be&nbsp; operated &nbsp;by seasoned threat actors who used to be part of Conti Team One, cybersecurity company Trend Micro disclosed in December 2022. The ransomware group employs call back phishing as a means of delivering their ransomware to victims, a technique&nbsp; widely adopted &nbsp;by criminal groups that splintered from the Conti enterprise last year following its shutdown.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging organizations and individuals to increase their cyber vigilance, as Russia's military invasion of Ukraine officially&nbsp; enters one year .

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday&nbsp; added &nbsp;three flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, citing evidence of active abuse in the wild. Included among the three is&nbsp; CVE-2022-24990 , a bug affecting TerraMaster network-attached storage (TNAS) devices that could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution with the highest privileges. Details about the flaw were&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by Ethiopian cyber security research firm Octagon Networks in March 2022. The vulnerability, according to a&nbsp; joint advisory &nbsp;released by U.S. and South Korean government authorities, is said to have been weaponized by North Korean nation-state hackers to strike healthcare and critical infrastructure entities with ransomware. The second shortcoming to be added to KEV catalog is&nbsp; CVE-2015-2291 , an unspecified flaw in the Intel ethernet diagnostics driver for Windows (IQVW32.sys and IQVW64.sys) that could throw an affected device into a denial-of-service

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has&nbsp; issued &nbsp;an alert warning of cyber attacks against state authorities in the country that deploy a legitimate remote access software named Remcos. The mass phishing campaign has been attributed to a threat actor it tracks as&nbsp; UAC-0050 , with the agency describing the activity as likely motivated by espionage given the toolset employed. The bogus emails that kick-start the infection sequence claim to be from Ukrainian telecom company Ukrtelecom and come bearing a decoy RAR archive. Of the two files present in the file, one is a password-protected RAR archive that's over 600MB and the other is a text file containing the password to open the RAR file. Embedded within the second RAR archive is an executable that leads to the installation of the Remcos remote access software, granting the attacker full access to commandeer compromised computers. Remcos , short for remote control and surveillance software, is offered by B

The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on Thursday warned of spear-phishing attacks mounted by Russian and Iranian state-sponsored actors for information-gathering operations. "The attacks are not aimed at the general public but targets in specified sectors, including academia, defense, government organizations, NGOs, think tanks, as well as politicians, journalists and activists," the NCSC&nbsp; said . The agency attributed the intrusions to&nbsp; SEABORGIUM &nbsp;(aka Callisto, COLDRIVER, and TA446) and&nbsp; APT42 &nbsp;(aka ITG18, TA453, and Yellow Garuda). The similarities in the modus operandi aside, there is no evidence the two groups are collaborating with each other. The activity is typical of spear-phishing campaigns, where the threat actors send messages tailored to the targets, while also taking enough time to research their interests and identify their social and professional circles. The initial contact is designed to appear innocuous in an attempt to gain their trust and c

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has released several Industrial Control Systems (ICS)&nbsp; advisories &nbsp;warning of critical security flaws affecting products from Sewio, InHand Networks, Sauter Controls, and Siemens. The most severe of the flaws relate to Sewio's RTLS Studio, which could be exploited by an attacker to "obtain unauthorized access to the server, alter information, create a denial-of-service condition, gain escalated privileges, and execute arbitrary code,"&nbsp; according to CISA . This includes CVE-2022-45444 (CVSS score: 10.0), a case of hard-coded passwords for select users in the application's database that potentially grant remote adversaries unrestricted access. Also notable are two command injection flaws (CVE-2022-47911 and CVE-2022-43483, CVSS scores: 9.1) and an out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CVE-2022-41989, CVSS score: 9.1) that could result in denial-of-service condition or code execution.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ransomware: contemporary threats, how to prevent them and how the FBI can help In April 2021, Dutch supermarkets faced a food shortage. The cause wasn't a drought or a sudden surge in the demand for avocados. Rather, the reason was a ransomware attack. In the past years, companies, universities, schools, medical facilities and other organizations have been targeted by ransomware threat actors, turning ransomware into the internet's most severe security crisis. The Ransomware Landscape Ransomware has existed for more than 30 years, but it became a lucrative source of income for cyber actors and gangs in the past decade. Since 2015, ransomware gangs have been targeting organizations instead of individuals. Consequently, ransom sums have increased significantly, reaching millions of dollars. Ransomware is effective because it pressures victims in two, complementary ways. First, by threatening victims to destroy their data. Second, by threatening to publicize the attack. The s

CISA Warns of Multiple Critical Vulnerabilities Affecting Mitsubishi Electric PLCs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/12/cisa-warns-of-multiple-critical.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) this week released an Industrial Control Systems (ICS) advisory warning of multiple vulnerabilities in Mitsubishi Electric GX Works3 engineering software.  "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized users to gain access to the MELSEC iQ-R/F/L series CPU modules and the MELSEC iQ-R series OPC UA server module or to view and execute programs," the agency&nbsp; said .  GX Works3 &nbsp;is an&nbsp; engineering workstation &nbsp;software used in ICS environments, acting as a mechanism for uploading and downloading programs from/to the controller, troubleshooting software and hardware issues, and performing maintenance operations.   The wide range of functions also makes them an attractive target for threat actors looking to compromise such systems to commandeer the&nbsp; managed PLCs .  Three of the 10 shortcomings relate to cleartext storage of sensitive data, four relate to the use of a hard-coded cryptograp

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Monday&nbsp; added &nbsp;a critical flaw impacting Oracle Fusion Middleware to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) Catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation.  The vulnerability, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-35587 , carries a CVSS score of 9.8 and impacts Oracle Access Manager (OAM) versions 11.1.2.3.0, 12.2.1.3.0, and 12.2.1.4.0.   Successful exploitation of the remote command execution bug could enable an unauthenticated attacker with network access to completely compromise and take over Access Manager instances.  "It may give the attacker access to OAM server, to create any user with any privileges, or just get code execution in the victim's server," Vietnamese security researcher Nguyen Jang ( Janggggg ), who reported the bug alongside&nbsp; peterjson ,&nbsp; noted &nbsp;earlier this March.   The issue was addressed by Oracle as part of its&nbsp; Critical Patch Update &nbsp;in January 2022.   Additional details regarding the natu

CISA Warns of Critical Vulnerabilities in 3 Industrial Control System Software<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/cisa-warns-of-critical-vulnerabilities.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; published &nbsp;three Industrial Control Systems (ICS) advisories about multiple vulnerabilities in software from ETIC Telecom, Nokia, and Delta Industrial Automation.  Prominent among them is a set of three flaws affecting ETIC Telecom's Remote Access Server (RAS), which "could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information and compromise the vulnerable device and other connected machines," CISA said.   This includes CVE-2022-3703 (CVSS score: 9.0), a critical flaw that stems from the RAS web portal's inability to verify the authenticity of firmware, thereby making it possible to slip in a rogue package that grants backdoor access to the adversary.  Two other flaws relate to a directory traversal bug in the RAS API (CVE-2022-41607, CVSS score: 8.6) and a file upload issue (CVE-2022-40981, CVSS score: 8.3) that can be exploited to read arbitrary files and upload malicious files that can compromise th

U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have published a joint advisory warning of attacks perpetrated by a cybercrime gang known as the&nbsp; Daixin Team &nbsp;primarily targeting the healthcare sector in the country.  "The Daixin Team is a ransomware and data extortion group that has targeted the HPH Sector with ransomware and data extortion operations since at least June 2022," the agencies&nbsp; said .  The alert was published Friday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).   Over the past four months, the group has been linked to multiple ransomware incidents in the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) sector, encrypting servers related to electronic health records, diagnostics, imaging, and intranet services.  It's also said to have exfiltrated personal identifiable information (PII) and patient health information (PHI) as part of a double extortion scheme to se

Acknowledging that you have a problem is the first step to addressing the problem in a serious way.

The text of the announcement contains several statements that anyone who's ever read about cybersecurity will have heard many times over: increasing resilience, greater awareness, countering ransomware attacks – the list goes on.&nbsp;  There are some novel aspects to the text as well, including a realization that cybersecurity is not, has never been, and will never be something that can be solved at the nation-state level.&nbsp;  The White House also pointed to IoT warning labels as a solution – and reminded us all (and we do need reminding) about the importance of cybersecurity education. Let's take a look.  International cooperation is critical  A key point that the White House statement makes very clear is that cyberattacks are asymmetric in the

U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies on Tuesday disclosed that multiple nation-state hacking groups potentially targeted a "Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organization's enterprise network" as part of a cyber espionage campaign.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a new Binding Operational Directive (BOD) that directs federal agencies in the country to keep track of assets and vulnerabilities on their networks six months from now.  To that end, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) enterprises have been tasked with two sets of activities: Asset discovery and vulnerability enumeration, which are seen as essential steps to gain "greater visibility into risks facing federal civilian networks."   This&nbsp; involves &nbsp;carrying out automated asset discovery every seven days and initiating vulnerability enumeration across those discovered assets every 14 days by April 3, 2023, in addition to having the capabilities to do so on an on-demand basis within 72 hours of receiving a request from CISA.  Similar baseline vulnerability enumeration obligations have also been put in place for Android and iOS devices as well as other devices that reside outside of agency on-premise

CISA Warns of Hackers Exploiting Critical Atlassian Bitbucket Server Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/cisa-warns-of-hackers-exploiting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday&nbsp; added &nbsp;a recently disclosed critical flaw impacting Atlassian's Bitbucket Server and Data Center to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-36804 , the issue relates to a command injection vulnerability that could allow malicious actors to gain arbitrary code execution on susceptible installations by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.  Successful exploitation, however, banks on the prerequisite that the attacker already has access to a public repository or possesses read permissions to a private Bitbucket repository.   "All versions of Bitbucket Server and Datacenter released after 6.10.17 including 7.0.0 and newer are affected, this means that all instances that are running any versions between 7.0.0 and 8.3.0 inclusive are affected by this vulnerability," Atlassian&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in a late August 2022 advisory.

The Ukrainian government on Monday warned of "massive cyberattacks" by Russia targeting critical infrastructure facilities located in the country and that of its allies.  The attacks are said to be targeting the energy sector, the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine (GUR) said.  "By the cyberattacks, the enemy will try to increase the effect of missile strikes on electricity supply facilities, primarily in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine," the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a brief advisory.   GUR also cautioned of intensified distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks aimed at the critical infrastructure of Ukraine's closest allies, chiefly Poland and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.  It's not immediately clear what prompted the intelligence agency to issue the notice, but Ukraine has been at the receiving end of&nbsp; disruptive and destructive cyberattacks &nbsp;since the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war earli

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese hacking group has been attributed to a new campaign aimed at infecting government officials in Europe, the Middle East, and South America with a modular malware known as PlugX.  Cybersecurity firm Secureworks said it identified the intrusions in June and July 2022, once again demonstrating the adversary's continued focus on espionage against governments around the world.  "PlugX is modular malware that contacts a command and control (C2) server for tasking and can download additional plugins to enhance its capability beyond basic information gathering," Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.   Bronze President is a China-based threat actor active since at least July 2018 and is likely estimated to be a state-sponsored group that leverages a mix of proprietary and publicly available tools to compromise and collect data from its targets.

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Monday warned of cyber criminals increasingly exploiting flaws in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to plunder cryptocurrency.  "The FBI has observed cyber criminals exploiting vulnerabilities in the smart contracts governing DeFi platforms to steal investors' cryptocurrency," the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a notification.  Attackers are said to have used different methods to hack and steal cryptocurrency from DeFi platforms, including initiating flash loans that trigger exploits in the platforms' smart contracts and exploiting signature verification flaws in their token bridge to withdraw all investments.   The agency has also observed criminals defrauding the platforms by manipulating cryptocurrency price pairs – assets that can be traded for each other on an exchange – by exploiting a series of vulnerabilities to bypass&nbsp; slippage checks &nbsp;and steal roughly $35 million in digital funds.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday added 10 new actively exploited vulnerabilities to its&nbsp; Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , including a high-severity security flaw affecting industrial automation software from Delta Electronics.  The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-38406 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), impacts DOPSoft 2 versions 2.00.07 and prior. A successful exploitation of the flaw may lead to arbitrary code execution.  "Delta Electronics DOPSoft 2 lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing specific project files (improper input validation) resulting in an out-of-bounds write that allows for code execution," CISA said in an alert.  It's worth noting that CVE-2021-38406 was originally disclosed as part of an industrial control systems (ICS) advisory&nbsp; published &nbsp;in September 2021.   However, there are no patches that address the vulnerability, with CISA noting that the "impacted product is end-of-life and shoul

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In recent months, the House of Representatives has been hard at work drafting various spending bills for the 2023 fiscal year. While these bills provide funding for a vast array of government programs and agencies, there was one thing that really stands out. Collectively, the bills that are making their way through the house&nbsp; allocate a staggering $15.6 billion to cybersecurity spending .  As you could probably guess, the lion's share of this spending ($11.2 billion) is being allocated to the Department of Defense. It is worth noting, however, that nearly $3 billion is going to the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).  Although it may be tempting to think of these cybersecurity budget allocations as just another example of excessive government spending, it's worth considering what a $15.6 billion cash infusion will mean for the IT security industry. It's equally important to consider why the US government finds it necessary to ramp up its cybersecurity

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday added a recently disclosed security flaw in the UnRAR utility to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.  Tracked as CVE-2022-30333 (CVSS score: 7.5), the issue concerns a path traversal vulnerability in the Unix versions of UnRAR that can be triggered upon extracting a maliciously crafted RAR archive.  This means that an adversary could exploit the flaw to drop arbitrary files on a target system that has the utility installed simply by decompressing the file. The vulnerability was&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;by SonarSource researcher Simon Scannell in late June.   "RARLAB UnRAR on Linux and UNIX contains a directory traversal vulnerability, allowing an attacker to write to files during an extract (unpack) operation," the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory.  Not much is known about the nature of the attacks, but the disclosure is evidence of a growing trend wherein threat acto

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Thursday added a recently disclosed high-severity vulnerability in the Zimbra email suite to its&nbsp; Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog , citing&nbsp; evidence of active exploitation .  The issue in question is&nbsp; CVE-2022-27924 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5), a command injection flaw in the platform that could lead to the execution of arbitrary Memcached commands and theft of sensitive information.   "Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) allows an attacker to inject memcached commands into a targeted instance which causes an overwrite of arbitrary cached entries," CISA said.  Specifically, the bug relates to a case of insufficient validation of user input that, if successfully exploited, could enable attackers to steal cleartext credentials from users of targeted Zimbra instances.   The issue was&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by SonarSource in June, with&nbsp; patches &nbsp;released by Zimbra on May 10, 2022, in versions 8.8.15 P31.1 and 9.0.0 P24.1.  CISA hasn

CISA Warns of Atlassian Confluence Hard-Coded Credential Bug Exploited in Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/cisa-warns-of-atlassian-confluence-hard.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday&nbsp; added &nbsp;the recently disclosed Atlassian security flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.  The vulnerability, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-26138 , concerns the use of hard-coded credentials when the Questions For Confluence app is enabled in Confluence Server and Data Center instances.   "A remote unauthenticated attacker can use these credentials to log into Confluence and access all content accessible to users in the confluence-users group," CISA&nbsp; notes &nbsp;in its advisory.   Depending on the page restrictions and the information a company has in Confluence, successful exploitation of the shortcoming could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.  Although the bug was addressed by the Atlassian software company last week in versions 2.7.38 and 3.0.5, it has since come under active exploitation , cybersecurity firm Rapid7&nbsp;disclosed&nbsp;this week.   &amp;quo

The U.S. State Department has announced rewards of up to $10 million for any information that could help disrupt North Korea's cryptocurrency theft, cyber-espionage, and other illicit state-backed activities.  "If you have information on any individuals associated with the North Korean government-linked malicious cyber groups (such as Andariel, APT38, Bluenoroff, Guardians of Peace, Kimsuky, or Lazarus Group) and who are involved in targeting U.S. critical infrastructure in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, you may be eligible for a reward," the department&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a tweet.  The amount is double the bounty the agency&nbsp; publicized &nbsp;in March 2022 for specifics regarding the financial mechanisms employed by state-sponsored actors working on behalf of the North Korean government.

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has warned of cyber criminals building rogue cryptocurrency-themed apps to defraud investors in the virtual assets space.  "The FBI has observed cyber criminals contacting U.S. investors, fraudulently claiming to offer legitimate cryptocurrency investment services, and convincing investors to download fraudulent mobile apps, which the cyber criminals have used with increasing success over time to defraud the investors of their cryptocurrency," the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;[PDF].   The illicit scheme, which aims to take advantage of increased interest in the crypto sector, is believed to have netted 244 victims, with losses estimated at $42.7 million between October 4, 2021, and May 13, 2022.  According to the law enforcement authority, threat actors are misusing the names, logos, and other identifying information of legitimate businesses to create fake websites in an attempt to lure potential investors.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned this week that it will crack down on tech companies' illegal use and sharing of highly sensitive data and false claims about data anonymization.  "While many consumers may happily offer their location data in exchange for real-time crowd-sourced advice on the fastest route home, they likely think differently about having their thinly-disguised online identity associated with the frequency of their visits to a therapist or cancer doctor," FTC's Kristin Cohen&nbsp; said .  The sensitive nature of information about users' health and their precise whereabouts has prompted the agency to caution against opaque practices in the "shadowy ad tech and&nbsp; data broker ecosystem ," with consumers having little to no knowledge of how their personal data is harvested, used, and processed.   What's more, mobile apps are known to embed software development kits (SDKs) that claim to collect and share anonymized user information

TikTok, in September 2021,&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;that there are one billion people who use its app every month, making it one of the largest social media platforms after Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, and WeChat.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) this week moved to&nbsp; add &nbsp;a Linux vulnerability dubbed&nbsp; PwnKit &nbsp;to its&nbsp; Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog , citing evidence of active exploitation.  The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-4034 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), came to light in January 2022 and concerns a case of&nbsp; local privilege escalation &nbsp;in polkit's pkexec utility, which allows an authorized user to execute commands as another user.   Polkit (formerly called PolicyKit) is a toolkit for controlling system-wide privileges in Unix-like operating systems, and provides a mechanism for non-privileged processes to communicate with privileged processes.  Successful exploitation of the flaw could induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code, granting an unprivileged attacker administrative rights on the target machine and compromising the host.  It's not immediately clear how the vulnerability is being weaponized in the wild, nor is there any information on the identity of

U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have&nbsp; warned &nbsp;about China-based state-sponsored cyber actors leveraging network vulnerabilities to exploit public and private sector organizations since at least 2020.

Highly skilled software and mobile app developers from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are posing as "non-DPRK nationals" in hopes of landing freelance employment in an attempt to enable the regime's&nbsp; malicious cyber intrusions .  That's according to a&nbsp; joint advisory &nbsp;from the U.S. Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued on Monday.  Targets include financial, health, social media, sports, entertainment, and lifestyle-focused companies located in North America, Europe, and East Asia, with most of the dispatched workers situated in China, Russia, Africa, and Southeast Asia.  The goal, the U.S. agencies warn, is to generate a constant stream of revenue that sidesteps international sanctions imposed on the nation and help serve its economic and security priorities, including the development of nuclear and ballistic missiles.   "The North Korean government withholds up to 90 perce

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple cybersecurity authorities from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. on Wednesday released a&nbsp; joint advisory &nbsp;warning of threats targeting managed service providers (MSPs) and their customers.  Key among the recommendations include identifying and disabling accounts that are no longer in use, enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) on MSP accounts that access customer environments, and ensuring transparency in ownership of security roles and responsibilities.  MSPs have emerged as an attractive attack route for cybercriminals to scale their attacks, as a vulnerable provider can be weaponized as an initial access vector to breach several downstream customers at once.   The spillover effects of such intrusions, as witnessed in the wake of high-profile breaches aimed at&nbsp; SolarWinds &nbsp;and&nbsp; Kaseya &nbsp;in recent years, have once again underlined the need to secure the software supply chain.

The Five Eyes nations comprising&nbsp; Australia ,&nbsp; Canada ,&nbsp; New Zealand ,&nbsp; the U.K. , and&nbsp; the U.S. , along with Ukraine and the European Union, formally pinned Russia for masterminding an attack on an international satellite communication ( SATCOM ) provider that had "spillover" effects across Europe.  The&nbsp; cyber offensive , which took place one hour before the Kremlin's military invasion of Ukraine on February 24, targeted the KA-SAT satellite network operated by telecommunications company Viasat, crippling the operations of wind farms and internet users in central Europe.  Viasat, in late March,&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;that it had shipped nearly 30,000 modems to distributors to restore service to customers whose modems were rendered unusable.

In February, CISA responded to the current situation by issuing an unusual " SHIELDS UP! " warning and advisory. According to CISA, "Every organization—large and small—must be prepared to respond to disruptive cyber incidents."  The announcement from CISA consisted of a range of recommendations to help organizations and individuals reduce the likelihood of a successful attack and limit damage in case the worst happens.

The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday moved to sanction virtual currency mixer Blender.io, marking the first time a mixing service has been subjected to economic blockades.

The newly imposed sanctions, issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), target 45 Bitcoin addresses linked to Blender.io and four new wallets linked to Lazarus Group, an advanced persistent with ties to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).  "Blender was used in processing over $20.5 million of the illicit proceeds," the Treasury&nbsp; said , adding it was utilized by DPRK to "support its malicious cyber activities and money-laundering of stolen virtual currency."

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on Thursday released an updated cybersecurity guidance for managing risks in the supply chain, as it increasingly emerges as a lucrative attack vector.  "It encourages organizations to consider the vulnerabilities not only of a finished product they are considering using, but also of its components — which may have been developed elsewhere — and the journey those components took to reach their destination," NIST said in a statement.   The new&nbsp; directive &nbsp;outlines&nbsp; major security controls and practices &nbsp;that entities should adopt to identify, assess, and respond to risks at different stages of the supply chain, including the possibility of malicious functionality, flaws in third-party software, insertion of counterfeit hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday announced that it will expand and rebrand its Cyber Unit to fight against cyber-related threats and protect investors in cryptocurrency markets.  To that end, the SEC is renaming the Cyber Unit within the&nbsp; Division of Enforcement &nbsp;to Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and plans to infuse 20 additional positions with the goal of investigating wrongdoing in the crypto markets.  The goal, per the agency, is to tackle cryptocurrency fraud and crackdown on&nbsp; malicious actors &nbsp;attempting to profit from crypto marketplaces.   The Cyber Unit was&nbsp; instituted &nbsp;in September 2017 with a focus on addressing cyber-based threats and protecting retail investors. But given the dramatic evolution of the digital assets markets in recent years, the new unit is expected to focus on securities law violations pertaining to -   Crypto asset offerings  Crypto asset exchanges  Crypto asset lending and staking products  Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is sounding the alarm on the BlackCat ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), which it said victimized at least 60 entities worldwide between as of March 2022 since its emergence last November.  Also called ALPHV and&nbsp; Noberus , the ransomware is notable for being the first-ever malware written in the Rust programming language that's known to be memory safe and offer improved performance.   "Many of the developers and money launderers for BlackCat/ALPHV are linked to&nbsp; DarkSide / BlackMatter , indicating they have extensive networks and experience with ransomware operations," the FBI said in an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;published last week.  The disclosure comes weeks after twin reports from&nbsp; Cisco Talos &nbsp;and&nbsp; Kasperksy &nbsp;uncovered links between BlackCat and BlackMatter ransomware families, including the use of a modified version of a data exfiltration tool dubbed Fendr that's been previously only observed in BlackMatter-related activity.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ukraine's technical security and intelligence service is warning of a new wave of cyber attacks that are aimed at gaining access to users' Telegram accounts.  "The criminals sent messages with malicious links to the Telegram website in order to gain unauthorized access to the records, including the possibility to transfer a one-time code from SMS," the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection (SSSCIP) of Ukraine&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert.  The attacks , which have been attributed to a threat cluster called "UAC-0094," originate with Telegram messages alerting recipients that a login had been detected from a new device located in Russia and urging the users to confirm their accounts by clicking on a link.  The URL, in reality a phishing domain, prompts the victims to enter their phone numbers as well as the one-time passwords sent via SMS that are then used by the threat actors to take over the accounts.

The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday sanctioned Hydra, the same day German law enforcement authorities&nbsp; disrupted &nbsp;the world's largest and longest-running dark web marketplace following a coordinated operation in partnership with U.S. officials.  The sanctions are part of an "international effort to disrupt proliferation of malicious cybercrime services, dangerous drugs, and other illegal offerings available through the Russia-based site," the Treasury Department&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement.  Along with the sanctions, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) disclosed a list of&nbsp; more than 100 virtual currency addresses &nbsp;that have been identified as associated with the entity's operations to conduct illicit transactions.  The sanctions come as Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office shut down the online criminal marketplace that it said specialized in narcotics trade, seizing its servers and 543 bitcoins worth 23 million euros ($25.3 million).

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Monday added the recently disclosed remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting the Spring Framework, to its&nbsp; Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog &nbsp;based on "evidence of active exploitation."  The critical severity flaw, assigned the identifier&nbsp; CVE-2022-22965 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8) and dubbed "Spring4Shell", impacts Spring model–view–controller (MVC) and Spring WebFlux applications running on Java Development Kit 9 and later.  "Exploitation requires an endpoint with DataBinder enabled (e.g., a POST request that decodes data from the request body automatically) and depends heavily on the servlet container for the application," Praetorian researchers Anthony Weems and Dallas Kaman noted last week.

UPS devices, in addition to offering power backups in mission-critical environments, are also equipped with an internet of things (IoT) capability, enabling the administrators to carry out power monitoring and routine maintenance. But as is often the case, such features can also open the door to malicious attacks.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Friday&nbsp; moved &nbsp;to add Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab to the " Covered List " of companies that pose an "unacceptable risk to the national security" of the country.

The block list includes information security products, solutions, and services supplied, directly or indirectly, by the company or any of its predecessors, successors, parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates.  The FCC said the decision was made pursuant to a Binding Operational Directive (BOD)&nbsp; issued &nbsp;by the Department of Homeland Security on September 11, 2017 that barred federal agencies from using Kaspersky-branded products in their information systems.

The development comes as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned of "possible threats" to U.S. and international satellite communication (SATCOM) networks in the wake of a cyber attack targeting&nbsp; Viasat KA-SAT network , used extensively by the Ukrainian military, roughly around the time when Russian armed forces invaded Ukraine on February 24.

The Russian government has established its own TLS certificate authority ( CA ) to address issues with accessing websites that have arisen in the wake of sanctions imposed by the west following the country's unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine.  According to a message posted on the&nbsp; Gosuslugi &nbsp;public services portal, the Ministry of Digital Development is expected to provide a domestic replacement to handle the issuance and renewal of TLS certificates should they get revoked or expired.  The service is offered to all legal entities operating in Russia, with the certificates delivered to site owners upon request within 5 working days.  TLS certificates are used to digitally bind a cryptographic key to an organization's details, enabling web browsers to confirm the domain's authenticity and ensure that the communication between a client computer and the target website is secure.   The proposal comes as companies like DigiCert have been&nbsp; restricted &nbsp;from doing business in

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) last week published an industrial control system ( ICS ) advisory related to multiple vulnerabilities impacting Schneider Electric's&nbsp; Easergy &nbsp;medium voltage protection relays.  "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may disclose device credentials, cause a denial-of-service condition, device reboot, or allow an attacker to gain full control of the relay," the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a bulletin on February 24, 2022. "This could result in loss of protection to your electrical network."   The two high-severity weaknesses impact Easergy P3 versions prior to v30.205 and Easergy P5 versions before v01.401.101. Details of the flaws are as follows –   CVE-2022-22722 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5) – Use of hardcoded credentials that could be abused to observe and manipulate traffic associated with the device.  CVE-2022-22723 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2022-22725 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8) – A buffer overflow vulnerability that could resu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; warned &nbsp;of active exploitation of two security flaws impacting Zabbix open-source enterprise monitoring platform, adding them to its&nbsp; Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog .  On top of that, CISA is also recommending that Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies patch all systems against the vulnerabilities by March 8, 2022 to reduce their exposure to potential cyberattacks.   Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-23131 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8) and&nbsp; CVE-2022-23134 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 5.3), the shortcomings could lead to the compromise of complete networks, enabling a malicious unauthenticated actor to escalate privileges and gain admin access to the Zabbix Frontend as well as make configuration changes.   Thomas Chauchefoin from SonarSource has been credited with discovering and reporting the two flaws, which affect Zabbix Web Frontend versions up to and including 5.4.8, 5.0.18 and 4.0.36. The issues have since been addressed in vers

U.S. Says Russian Hackers Stealing Sensitive Data from Defense Contractors<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/us-says-russian-hackers-stealing.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
State-sponsored actors backed by the Russian government regularly targeted the networks of several U.S. cleared defense contractors (CDCs) to acquire proprietary documents and other confidential information pertaining to the country's defense and intelligence programs and capabilities.  The sustained espionage campaign is said to have commenced at least two years ago from January 2020, according to a&nbsp; joint advisory &nbsp;published by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).  "These continued intrusions have enabled the actors to acquire sensitive, unclassified information, as well as CDC-proprietary and export-controlled technology," the agencies&nbsp; said . "The acquired information provides significant insight into U.S. weapons platforms development and deployment timelines, vehicle specifications, and plans for communications infrastructure and information technology."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Entities in the aviation, aerospace, transportation, manufacturing, and defense industries have been targeted by a persistent threat group since at least 2017 as part of a string of spear-phishing campaigns mounted to deliver a variety of remote access trojans (RATs) on compromised systems.  The use of commodity malware such as AsyncRAT and NetWire, among others, has led enterprise security firm Proofpoint to a "cybercriminal threat actor" codenamed TA2541  that employs "broad targeting with high volume messages." The ultimate objective of the intrusions is unknown as yet.  Social engineering lures used by the group does not rely on topical themes but rather leverages decoy messages related to&nbsp; aviation , logistics, transportation, and travel. That said, TA2541 did briefly pivot to&nbsp; COVID-19-themed lures &nbsp;in the spring of 2020, distributing emails concerning cargo shipments of personal protective equipment (PPE) or testing kits.

The government of Ukraine on Sunday formally accused Russia of masterminding the attacks that targeted websites of public institutions and government agencies this past week.  "All the evidence points to the fact that Russia is behind the cyber attack," the Ministry of Digital Transformation&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement.

The purpose of the attack, said the ministry, "is not only to intimidate society," but to also "destabilize the situation in Ukraine by stopping the work of the public sector and undermining the confidence in the government on the part of Ukrainians."   Russia, however, has denied it was behind the intrusion.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Amid renewed tensions between the U.S. and Russia over&nbsp; Ukraine &nbsp;and&nbsp; Kazakhstan , American cybersecurity and intelligence agencies on Tuesday released a joint advisory on how to detect, respond to, and mitigate cyberattacks orchestrated by Russian state-sponsored actors.  To that end, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and National Security Agency (NSA) have laid bare the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted by the adversaries, including spear-phishing, brute-force, and&nbsp; exploiting known vulnerabilities &nbsp;to gain initial access to target networks.   The list of flaws exploited by Russian hacking groups to gain an initial foothold, which the agencies said are "common but effective," are below —   CVE-2018-13379 &nbsp;(FortiGate VPNs)  CVE-2019-1653 &nbsp;(Cisco router)  CVE-2019-2725 &nbsp;(Oracle WebLogic Server)  CVE-2019-7609 &nbsp;(Kibana)  CVE-2019-9670 &nbsp;(Zimbra software)  CVE-2019-10149 &nbsp;(Exim Simple Mail Transf

Europol Ordered to Delete Data of Individuals With No Proven Links to Crimes<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/europol-ordered-to-delete-data-of.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The European Union's data protection watchdog on Monday ordered Europol to delete a vast trove of personal data it obtained pertaining to individuals with no proven links to criminal activity.  "Datasets older than six months that have not undergone this Data Subject Categorisation must be erased," the European Data Protection Supervisor ( EDPS )&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a press statement. "This means that Europol will no longer be permitted to retain data about people who have not been linked to a crime or a criminal activity for long periods with no set deadline."   EDPS' investigation into Europol's handling of sensitive data commenced in April 2019, with the authority noting that the storage of large volumes of data with no Data Subject Categorisation poses a risk to individuals' fundamental rights and amounts to mass surveillance. The cache is said to contain at least four petabytes,&nbsp; according &nbsp;to The Guardian.  In addition, the ruling also imposed a six-mon

The digital security team at the U.K. National Health Service (NHS) has raised the alarm on active exploitation of Log4Shell vulnerabilities in unpatched&nbsp; VMware Horizon &nbsp;servers by an unknown threat actor to drop malicious web shells and establish persistence on affected networks for follow-on attacks.  "The attack likely consists of a reconnaissance phase, where the attacker uses the Java Naming and Directory InterfaceTM (JNDI) via Log4Shell payloads to call back to malicious infrastructure," the non-departmental public body&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert. "Once a weakness has been identified, the attack then uses the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to retrieve and execute a malicious Java class file that injects a web shell into the VM Blast Secure Gateway service."   The web shell, once deployed, can serve as a conduit to carry out a multitude of post-exploitation activities such as deploying additional malicious software, data exfiltration, or deployment of r

NIST Cybersecurity Framework: A Quick Guide for SaaS Security Compliance<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/nist-cybersecurity-framework-quick.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
When I want to know the most recently published best practices in cyber security, I visit The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). From the latest password requirements (NIST 800-63) to IoT security for manufacturers (NISTIR 8259), NIST is always the starting point. NIST plays a key role as a US standard-setter, due to the organization's professionalism and the external experts who help to create NIST documents.  The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) was initially released in 2014 and last updated in 2018. The framework enables organizations to improve the security and resilience of critical infrastructure with a well-planned and easy-to-use framework.  The continuing growth in SaaS, and the major changes to the work environment due to COVID-19 bring new security challenges. Although the CSF was written and updated while SaaS was on the rise, it is still geared towards the classic legacy critical infrastructure security challenges. However, organizations can bet

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity agencies from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.S., and the U.K. on Wednesday released a joint advisory in response to widespread exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities in Apache's Log4j software library by nefarious adversaries.  "These vulnerabilities, especially Log4Shell, are severe," the intelligence agencies said in the&nbsp; new &nbsp; guidance . "Sophisticated cyber threat actors are actively scanning networks to potentially exploit&nbsp; Log4Shell ,&nbsp; CVE-2021-45046 , and&nbsp; CVE-2021-45105 &nbsp;in vulnerable systems. These vulnerabilities are likely to be exploited over an extended period."   An attacker can exploit Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) by submitting a specially crafted request to a vulnerable system that causes that system to execute arbitrary code. CVE-2021-45046, on the other hand, allows for remote code execution in certain non-default configurations, while CVE-2021-45105 could be leveraged by a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS

China's internet regulator, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), has temporarily suspended a partnership with Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing subsidiary of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, for six months on account of the fact that it failed to promptly inform the government about a critical security vulnerability affecting the broadly used Log4j logging library.  The development was disclosed by&nbsp; Reuters &nbsp;and&nbsp; South China Morning Post , citing a report from 21st Century Business Herald, a Chinese business-news daily newspaper.  "Alibaba Cloud did not immediately report vulnerabilities in the popular, open-source logging framework Apache Log4j2 to China's telecommunications regulator," Reuters said. "In response, MIIT suspended a cooperative partnership with the cloud unit regarding cybersecurity threats and information-sharing platforms."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The last several years have seen an ever-increasing number of cyber-attacks, and while the frequency of such attacks has increased, so too has the resulting damage. One needs only to look at&nbsp; CISA's list of significant cyber incidents &nbsp;to appreciate the magnitude of the problem. In May of 2021, for example, a ransomware attack brought down the Colonial Pipeline, causing a serious fuel disruption for much of the United States.  Just last month, a hacking group gained access to call logs and text messages from telecommunications carriers all over the world. These are just two of dozens of cyber-attacks occurring this year.  Because of these and other cyber security incidents, the Department of Homeland Security issues a&nbsp; compulsory directive &nbsp;to federal agencies to better protect federal information systems and the data that they contain against cyber-attack. This directive is based around&nbsp; CISA's catalog of vulnerabilities &nbsp;that are known to pose a significant risk. The directi

Why Everyone Needs to Take the Latest CISA Directive Seriously<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/why-everyone-needs-to-take-latest-cisa.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government agencies publish notices and directives all the time. Usually, these are only relevant to government departments, which means that nobody else really pays attention. It's easy to see why you would assume that a directive from CISA just doesn't relate to your organization.  But, in the instance of the latest CISA directive, that would be making a mistake. In this article, we explain why, even if you're in the private or non-government sector, you should nonetheless take a close look at CISA Binding Operational Directive 22-01.  We outline why CISA was forced to issue this directive, and why that firm action has implications for all organizations – inside and outside of government. Acting on cybersecurity issues isn't as simple as flicking a switch, of course, so keep reading to find out how you can address the core issue behind the CISA directive.  Okay, so what exactly is a CISA directive?  Let's take a step back to gain some context. Just like any organ

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are warning of active exploitation of a newly patched flaw in Zoho's ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus product to deploy web shells and carry out an array of malicious activities.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-44077 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the issue relates to an unauthenticated, remote code execution vulnerability affecting ServiceDesk Plus versions up to and including 11305 that, if left unfixed, "allows an attacker to upload executable files and place web shells that enable post-exploitation activities, such as compromising administrator credentials, conducting lateral movement, and exfiltrating registry hives and Active Directory files," CISA&nbsp; said .   "A security misconfiguration in ServiceDesk Plus led to the vulnerability," Zoho&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in an independent advisory published on November 22. "This vulnerability can allow an adversary to execute arbitrary code

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has disclosed that an unidentified threat actor has been exploiting a previously unknown weakness in the FatPipe MPVPN networking devices at least since May 2021 to obtain an initial foothold and maintain persistent access into vulnerable networks, making it the latest company to join the likes of Cisco, Fortinet, Citrix, Pulse Secure that have had their systems exploited in the wild.  "The vulnerability allowed APT actors to gain access to an unrestricted file upload function to drop a web shell for exploitation activity with root access, leading to elevated privileges and potential follow-on activity," the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert published this week. "Exploitation of this vulnerability then served as a jumping off point into other infrastructure for the APT actors."   In other words, the zero-day vulnerability enables a remote attacker to upload a file to any location on the filesystem on an affected device. The se

CISA Adds Single-Factor Authentication to the List of Bad Practices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/cisa-adds-single-factor-authentication.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Monday&nbsp; added &nbsp;single-factor authentication to the short list of "exceptionally risky" cybersecurity practices that could expose critical infrastructure as well as government and the private sector entities to devastating cyberattacks.  Single-factor authentication is a&nbsp; method &nbsp;of signing in users to websites and remote systems by using only one way of verifying their identity, typically a combination of username and password. It's considered to be of low-security, since it heavily relies on "matching one factor — such as a password — to a username to gain access to a system."   But with weak, reused, and common passwords posing a grave threat and emerging a lucrative attack vector, the use of single-factor authentication can lead to unnecessary risk of compromise and increase the possibility of account takeover by cybercriminals.  With the latest development, the&nbsp; list of bad practices &nbsp;now e

Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which first spotted the infections in October 2020, attributed them to a threat actor it tracks as " LuminousMoth ," which it connected with medium to high confidence to a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group called HoneyMyte or&nbsp; Mustang Panda , given its observed victimology, tactics, and procedures.  About 100 affected victims have been identified in Myanmar, while the number of victims jumped to nearly 1,400 in the Philippines, although the researchers noted that the actual targets were only a fraction of the initial numbers, including government entities located both within the two countries and abroad.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Bad actors with suspected ties to China have been behind a wide-ranging cyberespionage campaign targeting military organizations in Southeast Asia for nearly two years, according to new research.  Attributing the attacks to a threat actor dubbed " Naikon APT ," cybersecurity firm Bitdefender laid out the ever-changing tactics, techniques, and procedures adopted by the group, including weaving new backdoors named "Nebulae" and "RainyDay" into their data-stealing missions. The malicious activity is said to have been conducted between June 2019 and March 2021.  "In the beginning of the operation the threat actors used Aria-Body loader and Nebulae as the first stage of the attack," the researchers&nbsp; said . "Starting with September 2020, the threat actors included the RainyDay backdoor in their toolkit. The purpose of this operation was cyberespionage and data theft."   Naikon  (aka Override Panda, Lotus Panda, or Hellsing) has a track recor

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Monday published a new joint advisory as part of their latest attempts to expose the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) in its attacks targeting the U.S and foreign entities.  By employing "stealthy intrusion tradecraft within compromised networks," the intelligence agencies&nbsp; said , "the SVR activity—which includes the recent&nbsp; SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise —primarily targets government networks, think tank and policy analysis organizations, and information technology companies and seeks to gather intelligence information."   The cyber actor is also being tracked under different monikers, including Advanced Persistent Threat 29 (APT29), the Dukes, CozyBear, and Yttrium.

No matter which type of business you are in, whether small, medium, or large, email has become an irrefutable tool for communicating with your employees, partners, and customers.  Emails are sent and received each day in bulk by companies from various sources.

The U.S. and U.K. on Thursday formally attributed the supply chain attack of IT infrastructure management company SolarWinds with "high confidence" to government operatives working for Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).

To that effect, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has imposed sweeping sanctions against Russia for "undermining the conduct of free and fair elections and democratic institutions" in the U.S. and for its role in facilitating the sprawling SolarWinds hack, while also barring six technology companies in the country that provide support to the cyber program run by Russian Intelligence Services.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two new Android surveillanceware families have been found to target military, nuclear, and election entities in Pakistan and Kashmir as part of a pro-India, state-sponsored hacking campaign.  Dubbed Hornbill and Sunbird, the malware impersonates legitimate or seemingly innocuous services to cover its tracks, only to stealthily collect SMS, encrypted messaging app content, and geolocation, among other types of sensitive information.  The findings published by Lookout is the result of an analysis of 18GB of exfiltrated data that was publicly exposed from at least six insecurely configured command-and-control (C2) servers located in India.  "Some notable targets included an individual who applied for a position at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, individuals with numerous contacts in the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), as well as officers responsible for electoral rolls (Booth Level Officers) located in the Pulwama district of Kashmir," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday ana
