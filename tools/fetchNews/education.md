<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The most precious asset in today's information age is the secret safeguarded under lock and key. Regrettably, maintaining secrets has become increasingly challenging, as highlighted by the&nbsp; 2023 State of Secrets Sprawl &nbsp;report, the largest analysis of public GitHub activity.&nbsp; The report shows a &nbsp;67% year-over-year increase &nbsp;in the number of secrets found, with 10 million hard-coded secrets detected in 2022 alone. This alarming surge in secrets sprawl highlights&nbsp; the need for action &nbsp;and underscores the importance of secure software development. Secrets sprawl refers to secrets appearing in plaintext in various sources, such as source code, build scripts, infrastructure as code, logs, etc. While secrets like API tokens and private keys securely connect the components of the modern software supply chain, their widespread distribution among developers, machines, applications, and infrastructure systems heightens the likelihood of leaks.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
It's no secret that data leaks have become a major concern for both citizens and institutions across the globe. They can cause serious damage to an organization's reputation, induce considerable financial losses, and even have serious legal repercussions. From the infamous Cambridge Analytica scandal to the Equifax data breach, there have been some pretty high-profile leaks resulting in massive consequences for the world's biggest brands. Breaches can also have a huge impact on individuals as well – ultimately leading to the loss of personal information, such as passwords or credit card details, which could be used by criminals for malicious purposes. Most notably victims are left vulnerable to identity theft or financial fraud.&nbsp; When you think about the sheer volume of these leaks, one would imagine that the world would stop and focus on the attack vector(s) being exploited. The unfortunate reality is the world didn't stop. To make things more interesting, the most

Digitalization initiatives are connecting once-isolated Operational Technology (OT) environments with their Information Technology (IT) counterparts. This digital transformation of the factory floor has accelerated the connection of machinery to digital systems and data. Computer systems for managing and monitoring digital systems and data have been added to the hardware and software used for managing and monitoring industrial devices and machines, connecting OT to IT. Such connectivity enhances productivity, reduces operational costs and speeds up processes. However, this convergence has also increased organizations' security risk, making manufacturers more susceptible to attacks. In fact, in 2022 alone, there were 2,337 security breaches of manufacturing systems, 338 with confirmed data disclosure (Verizon, 2022 DBIR Report).&nbsp; Ransomware: A Growing Threat for Manufacturers The nature of attacks has also changed.

Threat hunting is an essential component of your cybersecurity strategy. Whether you're getting started or in an advanced state, this article will help you ramp up your threat intelligence program. What is Threat Hunting? The cybersecurity industry is shifting from a reactive to a proactive approach. Instead of waiting for cybersecurity alerts and then addressing them, security organizations are now deploying red teams to actively seek out breaches, threats and risks, so they can be isolated. This is also known as "threat hunting."&nbsp; Why is Threat Hunting Required? Threat hunting complements existing prevention and detection security controls. These controls are essential for mitigating threats. However, they are optimized for low false positive alerting. Hunt solutions, on the other hand, are optimized for low false negatives. This means that the anomalies and outliers that are considered false positives for detection solutions, are hunting solutions' leads, to b

Almost half of MSP clients fell victim to a cyberattack within the last 12 months. In the SMB world, the danger is especially acute as only 50% of SMBs have a dedicated internal IT person to take care of cybersecurity. No wonder cybercriminals are targeting SMBs so heavily. No wonder SMBs are increasingly willing to pay a subscription or retainer to gain access to expert C-level cyber-assistance in devising and implementing strategies to prevent breaches, reduce risk, and mitigate the consequences of attacks. Hence the popularity of Virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) services. They are especially attractive to MSPs and MSSPs as:&nbsp; They enable service providers to address a growing need from their SMB clients for proactive cyber resilience&nbsp; They offer the potential to grow recurring revenues - expand into a new customer base or sell a new service to existing customers They help service providers differentiate themselves They are an excellent vehicle from which to u

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Just a few short years ago, lateral movement was a tactic confined to top APT cybercrime organizations and nation-state operators. Today, however, it has become a commoditized tool, well within the skillset of any ransomware threat actor. This makes real-time detection and prevention of lateral movement a necessity to organizations of all sizes and across all industries. But the disturbing truth is that there is actually no tool in the current security stack that can provide this real-time protection, creating what is arguably the most critical security weakness in an organization's security architecture.&nbsp; In this article, we'll walk through the most essentials questions around the challenge of lateral movement protection, understand why multifactor authentication (MFA) and service account protection are the gaps that make it possible, and learn how Silverfort's platform turns the tables on attackers and makes lateral movement protection finally within reach.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Stopping new and evasive threats is one of the greatest challenges in cybersecurity. This is among the biggest reasons why&nbsp; attacks increased dramatically in the past year &nbsp;yet again, despite the estimated $172 billion spent on global cybersecurity in 2022. Armed with cloud-based tools and backed by sophisticated affiliate networks, threat actors can develop new and evasive malware more quickly than organizations can update their protections.&nbsp; Relying on malware signatures and blocklists against these rapidly changing attacks has become futile. As a result, the SOC toolkit now largely revolves around threat detection and investigation. If an attacker can bypass your initial blocks, you expect your tools to pick them up at some point in the attack chain. Every organization's digital architecture is now seeded with security controls that log anything potentially malicious. Security analysts pore through these logs and determine what to investigate further. Does this work? Let'

Why is Visibility into OT Environments Crucial? The significance of Operational Technology (OT) for businesses is undeniable as the OT sector flourishes alongside the already thriving IT sector. OT includes industrial control systems, manufacturing equipment, and devices that oversee and manage industrial environments and critical infrastructures. In recent years, adversaries have recognized the lack of detection and protection in many industrial systems and are actively exploiting these vulnerabilities. In response, IT security leaders have become more aware of the need to protect their OT environments with security monitoring and response capabilities. This development was accelerated by severe past cyber incidents targeting critical OT environments and even causing physical damage to infrastructures. Given the pivotal role these systems play in business operations and modern society, ensuring their security is of utmost importance. The underlying trend is clear: OT and IoT networ

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and&nbsp; SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) &nbsp;are frequently confused. The similarity of the acronyms notwithstanding, both security solutions focus on securing data in the cloud. In a world where the terms cloud and SaaS are used interchangeably, this confusion is understandable. This confusion, though, is dangerous to organizations that need to secure data that exists within cloud infrastructures like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as data within SaaS applications like Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Jira, Zoom, Slack and more. Assuming that either your CSPM or SSPM will secure your company resources that live off-premises is misplaced trust in a security tool that was only designed to secure either your cloud or your SaaS stack.&nbsp; It's absolutely vital for decision makers to understand the difference between CSPM and SSPM, the value derived from each solution, and that both complement each other.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Shadow APIs are a growing risk for organizations of all sizes as they can mask malicious behavior and induce substantial data loss. For those that aren't familiar with the term, shadow APIs are a type of application programming interface (API) that isn't officially documented or supported.&nbsp; Contrary to popular belief, it's unfortunately all too common to have APIs in production that no one on your operations or security teams knows about. Enterprises manage thousands of APIs, many of which are not routed through a proxy such as an API gateway or web application firewall. This means they aren't monitored, are rarely audited, and are most vulnerable.&nbsp; Since they aren't visible to security teams, shadow APIs provide hackers with a defenseless path to exploit vulnerabilities. These APIs can potentially be manipulated by malicious actors to gain access to a range of sensitive information, from customer addresses to company financial records. Considering the potential

Critical infrastructure attacks are a preferred target for cyber criminals. Here's why and what's being done to protect them. What is Critical Infrastructure and Why is It Attacked? Critical infrastructure is the physical and digital assets, systems and networks that are vital to national security, the economy, public health, or safety. It can be government- or privately-owned. According to Etay Maor, Senior Director Security Strategy at&nbsp; Cato Networks , "It's interesting to note critical infrastructure doesn't necessarily have to be power plants or electricity. A nation's monetary system or even a global monetary system can be and should be considered a critical infrastructure as well." These qualities make critical infrastructure a preferred target for cyber attacks. If critical infrastructure is disrupted, the impact is significant. In some cases, such cyber attacks on critical infrastructure have become another means of modern warfare. But unlike

Any app that can improve business operations is quickly added to the SaaS stack. However, employees don't realize that this SaaS-to-SaaS connectivity, which typically takes place outside the view of the security team, significantly increases risk. Whether employees connect through Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, Salesforce, or any other app, security teams have no way to quantify their exposure. These 'secondary' apps can be requesting an intrusive set of permissions or be malicious. Every click authorizing access may grant the right to edit or delete company files, send emails on behalf of the user, create new files, or otherwise handle data in a way that poses a profound threat to the organization's security. To handle the SaaS Security challenges, security teams need to address the entire SaaS ecosystem.&nbsp; Today's SaaS security evolution has expanded SaaS security beyond simply preventing access.

Active Directory (AD) is a powerful authentication and directory service used by organizations worldwide. With this ubiquity and power comes the potential for abuse. Insider threats offer some of the most potentials for destruction. Many internal users have over-provisioned access and visibility into the internal network. Insiders' level of access and trust in a network leads to unique vulnerabilities. Network security often focuses on keeping a threat actor out, not on existing users' security and potential vulnerabilities. Staying on top of potential threats means protecting against inside and outside threats. Active Directory Vulnerabilities From the outside, a properly configured AD domain offers a secure authentication and authorization solution. But with complex social engineering and phishing email attacks, an existing AD user can become compromised. Once inside, threat actors have many options to attack Active Directory.

In the modern corporate IT environment, which relies on cloud connectivity, global connections and large volumes of data, the browser is now the most important work interface. The browser connects employees to managed resources, devices to the web, and the on-prem environment to the cloud one. Yet, and probably unsurprisingly, this browser prominence has significantly increased the number of threats that adversaries target the browser with. Attackers are now leveraging the browser's core functionality - rendering and executing web pages for users to access - to perform attacks. The browser is now an attack surface, as well as an attack vector for malicious access to corporate SaaS and web applications through account takeover and the use of compromised credentials. To address this issue, a new guide was recently published ( Download Here ). It analyzes what a solution to these threats would look like.

If you Google "third-party data breaches" you will find many recent reports of data breaches that were either caused by an attack at a third party or sensitive information stored at a third-party location was exposed. Third-party data breaches don't discriminate by industry because almost every company is operating with some sort of vendor relationship – whether it be a business partner, contractor or reseller, or the use of IT software or platform, or another service provider. Organizations are now sharing data with an average of 730 third-party vendors, according to a&nbsp; report by Osano , and with the acceleration of digital transformation, that number will only grow. The Importance of Third-Party Risk Management With more organizations sharing data with more third-party vendors, it shouldn't be surprising that more than 50% of security incidents in the past two years have stemmed from a third-party with access privileges, according to a&nbsp; CyberRisk Alliance report.

Security teams typically have great visibility over most areas, for example, the corporate network, endpoints, servers, and cloud infrastructure. They use this visibility to enforce the necessary security and compliance requirements. However, this is not the case when it comes to sensitive data sitting in production or analytic databases, data warehouses or data lakes. Security teams have to rely on data teams to locate sensitive data and enforce access controls and security policies. This is a huge headache for both the security and data teams. It weakens the business's security and compliance putting it at risk of exposing sensitive data, large fines, reputational damages, and more. Also, in many cases, it slows down the business's ability to scale up data operations. &nbsp;This article examines how Satori, a data security platform, gives control of the sensitive data in databases, data warehouses and data lakes to the security teams.

Bad actors love to deliver threats in files. Persistent and persuasive messages convince unsuspecting victims to accept and open files from unknown sources, executing the first step in a cyber attack.&nbsp; This continues to happen whether the file is an EXE or a Microsoft Excel document. Far too often, end users have an illusion of security, masked by good faith efforts of other users and (ineffective) security controls. This creates a virality effect for ransomware, malware, spyware, and annoying grayware and adware to be spread easily from user to user and machine to machine. To stop users from saying, "I reject your reality and substitute my own!" – it's time to bust some myths about file-based attacks.&nbsp; Testing in three! Two!

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In an ideal world, security and development teams would be working together in perfect harmony. But we live in a world of competing priorities, where DevOps and security departments often butt heads with each other. Agility and security &nbsp;are often at odds with each other— if a new feature is&nbsp; delivered quickly but &nbsp;contains security vulnerabilities, the SecOps team will need to scramble the release and patch the vulnerabilities, which can take days or weeks. On the other hand, if the SecOps team takes too long to review and approve a new feature, the development team will get frustrated with the slow pace of delivery. Security needs to move slowly and cautiously, while development wants to "move fast and break things" and release new features quickly. DevOps teams can view security as an impediment to their work instead of an important part of the process. With each team pulling in opposite directions, there is often tension and conflict between the two teams, slowing deve

One thing is clear. The " business value"&nbsp; of data continues to grow, making it an organization's primary piece of intellectual property. From a cyber risk perspective, attacks on data are the most prominent threat to organizations.&nbsp; Regulators, cyber insurance firms, and auditors are paying much closer attention to the integrity, resilience, and recoverability of organization data – as well as the IT infrastructure &amp; systems that store the data. What Impact Does This Have On The Security Of Storage &amp; Backup Systems? Just a few years ago, almost no CISO thought that storage &amp; backups were important. That's no longer the case today.&nbsp; Ransomware has pushed backup and recovery back onto the IT and corporate agenda. Cybercriminals, such as Conti, Hive and REvil, are&nbsp; targeting storage and backup &nbsp;systems, to prevent recovery. Some ransomwares – Locky and Crypto, for example – now bypass production systems altogether, and directly target backups. This

Here are three of the worst breaches, attacker tactics and techniques of 2022, and the security controls that can provide effective, enterprise security protection for them. #1: 2 RaaS Attacks in 13 Months Ransomware as a service is a type of attack in which the ransomware software and infrastructure are leased out to the attackers. These ransomware services can be purchased on the dark web from other threat actors and ransomware gangs. Common purchasing plans include buying the entire tool, using the existing infrastructure while paying per infection, or letting other attackers perform the service while sharing revenue with them. In this attack, the threat actor consists of one of the most prevalent ransomware groups, specializing in access via third parties, while the targeted company is a medium-sized retailer with dozens of sites in the United States. The threat actors used ransomware as a service to breach the victim's network. They were able to exploit third-party creden

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
When SaaS applications started growing in popularity, it was unclear who was responsible for securing the data. Today, most security and IT teams understand the shared responsibility model, in which the SaaS vendor is responsible for securing the application, while the organization is responsible for securing their data.&nbsp; What's far murkier, however, is where the data responsibility lies on the organization's side. For large organizations, this is a particularly challenging question. They store terabytes of customer data, employee data, financial data, strategic data, and other sensitive data records online.&nbsp; SaaS data breaches and SaaS ransomware attacks can lead to the loss or public exposure of that data. Depending on the industry, some businesses could face stiff regulatory penalties for data breaches on top of the negative PR and loss of faith these breaches bring with them.&nbsp; Finding the right security model is the first step before deploying any type of SSPM or other SaaS sec

Cybersecurity is quickly becoming one of the most significant growth drivers for Managed Service Providers (MSPs). That's the main insight from a&nbsp; recent study &nbsp;from Lumu: in North America, more than 80% of MSPs cite cybersecurity as a primary growth driver of their business. Service providers have a huge opportunity to expand their business and win new customers by developing their cybersecurity offerings. This hardly comes as a surprise since the demand for cybersecurity is in full swing among SMBs and larger enterprises. According to&nbsp; Gartner , "by 2025, 60% of organizations will use cybersecurity risk as a primary determinant in conducting third-party transactions and business engagements." This means that the perception around security is transforming: from liability, it's becoming a powerful business driver. Of course, cybersecurity continues to evolve at a very rapid pace, with threats emerging every day and the stakes getting higher. This alone can fuel the

Even a small data breach can result in significant damage to an organization's reputation and bottom line. There are two main reasons why regular pen testing is necessary for secure web application development: Security: &nbsp;Web applications are constantly evolving, and new vulnerabilities are being discovered all the time. Pen testing helps identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers and allows you to fix them before they can do any damage. Compliance:&nbsp; Depending on your industry and the type of data you handle, you may be required to comply with certain security standards (e.g., PCI DSS, NIST, HIPAA).

The move to SaaS and other cloud tools has put an emphasis on Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM). After all, user identity is one of the only barriers standing between sensitive corporate data and any unauthorized access.&nbsp; The tools used to define IAM make up its identity fabric. The stronger the fabric, the more resistant identities are to pressure from threat actors. However, those pressures are only increasing. Decentralized IT, evolving threats, and zero-trust tools are pushing many IAM tools to their limits.&nbsp; To maintain their effectiveness, IAM are shifting to operating as an agile, interconnected identity fabric rather than just siloed IAM tools. The demands of today's IT operating environment are forcing IAM to support decentralized IT environments while still providing centralized management and governance for its users. Interestingly, many of the identity fabric principles they define are currently found in leading SSPM tools. It's important to note that identity fabr

Earlier this year, threat actors infiltrated&nbsp; Mailchimp , the popular SaaS email marketing platform. They viewed over 300 Mailchimp customer accounts and exported audience data from 102 of them. The breach was preceded by a successful phishing attempt and led to malicious attacks against Mailchimp's customers' end users. Three months later, Mailchimp was hit with&nbsp; another attack . Once again, an employee's account was breached following a successful phishing attempt. While the identity of the Mailchimp accounts that had been compromised wasn't released, it's easy to see how user permission settings could have played a role in the attack. Once threat detectors breached the system, they had the access needed to utilize an internal tool that enabled them to find the data they were looking for. The attack ended when security teams were able to terminate user access, although data which had already been downloaded remained in the threat actor's hands. Introducing user permissions, throu

Challenges with an enforcement-based approach An enforcement-based approach to security begins with a security policy backed by security controls, often heavy-handed and designed to prevent employees from engaging in risky behavior or inadvertently expanding the potential attack surface of an organization.&nbsp; Most organizations exclusively use enforcement-based security controls, usually carried out at the network level with a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) or a Security Services Edge (SSE). CASBs secure data between on-premises and cloud architectures, validate authorization rules, and access controls against the company's security policy. Some organizations also use CASBs to block SaaS applications, but like SSEs, CASBs only support&nbsp; some &nbsp;applications. The applications these tools&nbsp; don't &nbsp;support are often the riskiest because they don't meet common industry and security standards, including SAML for authentication and SCIM for user management. At Cerby, these are called "unm

The new&nbsp; Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA) &nbsp;requires CISA to create rules regarding cyber incident reporting by critical infrastructure organizations. The RFI and hearings precede a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that CISA must publish sooner than&nbsp; 24 months &nbsp;from the enactment of CIRCIA, which the President signed into law&nbsp; in March . The sessions and NPRM are steps toward creating the new rule.&nbsp;  CISA is&nbsp; soliciting expert opinion on what to include &nbsp;in a report but is taking steps to implement the change soon. Here's what that change means for businesses in the US and what you can do about it now.&nbsp;  Overview of the CISA reporting rule&nbsp;  Owners and operators of critical infrastructure must file cyber incident reports with CISA&nbsp; within 72 hours .

Today's threat landscape is constantly evolving, and now more than ever, organizations and businesses in every sector have a critical need to consistently produce and maintain secure software. While some verticals - like the finance industry, for example - have been subject to regulatory and compliance requirements for some time, we are seeing a steady increase in attention on cybersecurity best practices at the highest levels of government, with the US, UK, and Australia all shining very recent light on the need for secure development at every stage of the SDLC.&nbsp;  Despite this, attackers are constantly finding new ways to bypass even the most advanced protections and defenses. For example, many have shifted their focus from delivering malware to instead compromising APIs, or launching targeted attacks&nbsp; against a supply chain . And while those high-level incidents are happening with much greater frequency, so too are the more simplistic exploits like cross-site scripting and SQL i

When the headlines focus on breaches of large enterprises like the Optus breach, it's easy for smaller businesses to think they're not a target for hackers. Surely, they're not worth the time or effort?&nbsp;  Unfortunately, when it comes to cyber security, size doesn't matter.&nbsp;  Assuming you're not a target leads to lax security practices in many SMBs who lack the knowledge or expertise to put simple security steps in place. Few small businesses prioritise cybersecurity, and hackers know it. According to Verizon, the number of smaller businesses being hit has climbed steadily in the last few years – 46% of cyber breaches in 2021 impacted businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees.&nbsp;  Cyber security doesn't need to be difficult  Securing any business doesn't need to be complex or come with a hefty price tag.

The best line of defense against holiday hacking schemes is a comprehensive&nbsp; incident response strategy &nbsp;that focuses on end-user vulnerabilities.&nbsp;  The holiday season is upon us and with it a slew of cybersecurity scams preying on end-user vulnerabilities.  Because employees often use their business emails and cell phones as their primary point of contact, these scams quickly become a threat to employer computer systems. With so many people shopping online, tracking shipments, and entering sensitive data across multiple websites, holiday hackers are primed and ready to attack your networks by taking advantage of your employees' online actions and cell phone usage.  According to the FBI, the two most frequent types of&nbsp; holiday scams &nbsp;include non-delivery and non-payment crimes – when a consumer either pays for a product or service that is never delivered or products being shipped without the seller receiving payment.

Deep Packet Inspection vs. Metadata Analysis of Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) Solutions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/deep-packet-inspection-vs-metadata.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Today, most Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions rely on traffic mirroring and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). Traffic mirroring is typically deployed on a single-core switch to provide a copy of the network traffic to a sensor that uses DPI to thoroughly analyze the payload. While this approach provides detailed analysis, it requires large amounts of processing power and is blind when it comes to encrypted network traffic. Metadata Analysis has been specifically developed to overcome these limitations. By utilizing metadata for analysis, network communications can be observed at any collection point and be enriched by the information providing insights about encrypted communication.  Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions have become crucial to reliably monitor and protect network operations. However, as network traffic becomes encrypted and data volumes continue to increase, most traditional NDR solutions are reaching their limits. This begs the question: What detect

What is an External Penetration Test?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/what-is-external-penetration-test.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A penetration test (also known as a pentest) is a security assessment that simulates the activities of real-world attackers to identify security holes in your IT systems or applications.&nbsp;  The aim of the test is to understand what vulnerabilities you have, how they could be exploited, and what the impact would be if an attacker was successful.  Usually performed first, an external pentest (also known as external network penetration testing) is an assessment of your perimeter systems. Your perimeter is all the systems that are directly reachable from the internet. By definition, they are exposed and are, therefore the most easily and regularly attacked.  Testing for weaknesses  External pentests look for ways to compromise these external, accessible systems and services to access sensitive information and see how an attacker could target your clients, customers or users.&nbsp;  In a high-quality external pentest, the security professional(s) will copy the activities of real hackers, like ex

In today's world of automated hacking systems, frequent data breaches and consumer protection regulations such as GDPR and PCI DSS, penetration testing is now an essential security requirement for organisations of all sizes. But what should you look for when choosing the right provider?  The sheer number of providers can be daunting, and finding one which can deliver a high-quality test at a reasonable price is not easy. How do you know if they're any good? What level of security expertise was included in the report? Is your application secure, or did the supplier simply not find the weaknesses?  There are no easy answers, but you can make it easier by asking the right questions up front. The most important considerations fall into three categories: certifications, experience, and price.

Cloud computing was the lifeline that kept many companies running during the pandemic.

The cloud is an asset or upgrade in almost every way.  With one glaring exception: cybersecurity.&nbsp;  The cloud promised to make companies more secure and security more straightforward. Yet over the same time period that the cloud took over computing, cyber attacks grew steadily worse while security teams felt increasingly overwhelmed.&nbsp;  Why?&nbsp;  We will explain shortly. For lean security teams, the more important question is how to make cloud security work, especially as the cloud footprint grows (a lot) faster than security resources.

Introduction  In many ways, the software supply chain is similar to that of manufactured goods, which we all know has been largely impacted by a global pandemic and shortages of raw materials.&nbsp;  However, in the IT world, it is not shortages or pandemics that have been the main obstacles to overcome in recent years, but rather attacks aimed at using them to harm hundreds or even thousands of victims simultaneously. If you've heard of a cyber attack between 2020 and today, it's likely that the software supply chain played a role.&nbsp;  When we talk about an attack on the software supply chain, we are actually referring to two successive attacks: one that targets a supplier, and one that targets one or more downstream users in the chain, using the first as a vehicle.  In this article, we will dive into the mechanisms and risks of the software supply chain by looking at a typical vulnerability of the modern development cycle: the presence of personal identifying information, or "

Not All Sandboxes Are for Children: How to Secure Your SaaS Sandbox<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/not-all-sandboxes-are-for-children-how.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
When creating a Sandbox, the mindset tends to be that the Sandbox is considered a place to play around, test things, and there will be no effect on the production or operational system. Therefore, people don't actively think they need to worry about its security. This mindset is not only wrong, but extremely dangerous.&nbsp;  When it comes to software developers, their version of sandbox is similar to a child's playground — a place to build and test without breaking any flows in production. Meanwhile, in the world of cybersecurity, the term 'sandbox' is used to describe a virtual environment or machine used to run suspicious code and other elements.&nbsp;  Many organizations use a Sandbox for their SaaS apps — to test changes without disrupting the production SaaS app or even to connect new apps (much like a software developer's Sandbox). This common practice often leads to a false sense of security and in turn a lack of thought for its security implications. This article wi

Every year, billions of credentials appear online, be it on the dark web, clear web, paste sites, or in data dumps shared by cybercriminals. These credentials are often used for account takeover attacks, exposing organizations to breaches, ransomware, and data theft.&nbsp;  While CISOs are aware of growing identity threats and have multiple tools in their arsenal to help reduce the potential risk, the reality is that existing methodologies have proven largely ineffective. According to the&nbsp; 2022 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report , over 60% of breaches involve compromised credentials.&nbsp;  Attackers use techniques such as social engineering, brute force, and purchasing leaked credentials on the dark web to compromise legitimate identities and gain unauthorized access to victim organizations' systems and resources.&nbsp;  Adversaries often leverage the fact that some passwords are shared among different users, making it easier to breach multiple accounts in the same organization.

5 Network Security Threats And How To Protect Yourself<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/5-network-security-threats-and-how-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity today matters so much because of everyone's dependence on technology, from collaboration, communication and collecting data to e-commerce and entertainment. Every organisation that needs to deliver services to their customers and employees must protect their IT 'network' - all the apps and connected devices from laptops and desktops to servers and smartphones.  While traditionally, these would all live on one "corporate network," - networks today are often just made up of the devices themselves, and how they're connected: across the internet, sometimes via VPNs, to the homes and cafes people work from, to the cloud and data centres where services live. So what threats does this modern network face?  Let's look at them in more detail.  #1 Misconfiguration  According to recent research by&nbsp; Verizon , misconfiguration errors and misuse now make up 14% of breaches.

Contemporary organizations understand the importance of data and its impact on improving interactions with customers, offering quality products or services, and building loyalty.  Data is fundamental to business success. It allows companies to make the right decisions at the right time and deliver the high-quality, personalized products and services that customers expect.  There is a challenge, though.  Businesses are collecting more data than ever before, and new technologies have accelerated this process dramatically. As a result, organizations have significant volumes of data, making it hard to manage, protect, and get value from it.  Here is where Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) comes in. GRC enables companies to define and implement the best practices, procedures, and governance to ensure the data is clean, safe, and reliable across the board.&nbsp;  More importantly,&nbsp; organizations can use GRC platforms like StandardFusion &nbsp;to create an organizational culture around security.

Security is critical for all organisations, including those that outsource key business operations to third parties like SaaS vendors and cloud providers. Rightfully so, since mishandled data – especially by application and network security providers – can leave organisations vulnerable to attacks, such as data theft, extortion and malware.  But how secure are the third parties you've entrusted with your data? SOC 2 is a framework that ensures these service providers securely manage data to protect their customers and clients.

Cyberattacks on large organizations dominate news headlines. So, you may be surprised to learn that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are actually&nbsp; more frequent &nbsp;targets of cyberattacks. Many SMEs understand this risk firsthand.&nbsp;  In a recent&nbsp; survey , 58% of CISOs of SMEs said that their risk of attack was higher compared to enterprises. Yet, they don't have the same resources as enterprises – making it nearly impossible to protect their organizations from widespread and increasingly more sophisticated attacks that don't discriminate based on company size.  What's their solution?  Extended detection and response (XDR).&nbsp;  During a recent webinar, Cynet's Director of Product Strategy, George Tubin , &nbsp;and guest speaker Senior Analyst at Forrester,Allie Mellen, discussed the most serious cybersecurity challenges for SMEs and how they can benefit from XDR platforms.&nbsp;  Here are the four key takeaways from the&nbsp; conversation .&nbsp;  The Biggest Cybersecurity Challenges for SME

Not all security teams are born equal. Each organization has a different objective.  In cybersecurity, adopting a proactive approach is not just a buzzword. It actually is what makes the difference between staying behind attackers and getting ahead of them. And the solutions to do that do exist!  Most attacks succeed by taking advantage of common failures in their target's systems. Whether new or not, known, unknown, or even unknown, attacks leverage security gaps such as&nbsp;  unpatched or uncharted vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, out-of-date systems, expired certificates, human errors, etc.  As attackers rely on a range of automated offensive testing tools to scan their targets' attack surfaces and propagate inside their network, a purely reactive defensive stance based on detection and response is increasingly likely to be overwhelmed by an attack.  The logical tactical move is to emulate attackers' TTPs and behaviors beforehand by integrating attack simulation tools to

The threat landscape has changed dramatically over the past decade. While cybercriminals continue to look for new ways to gain access to networks and steal sensitive information, the mobile attack surface is also expanding.  Mobile devices are not only becoming more powerful but also more vulnerable to cyberattacks, making mobile security an increasingly important concern for enterprises.  This means that anyone accessing the Internet via their cell phone or logging into their home or work network at any time is putting both their own personal data and that of their company at risk.  No matter how big or small your business is, you should always take steps to ensure the security of your employees and customers. Recent global attacks have shown us just how vulnerable businesses are to cyberattacks.  There are several ways hackers can attack mobile devices.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
From ransomware to breaches, from noncompliance penalties to reputational damage – cyberthreats pose an existential risk to any business. But for SMEs and SMBs, the danger is compounded. These companies realize they&nbsp; need &nbsp;an in-house Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) – someone who can assess risks and vulnerabilities, create and execute a comprehensive cybersecurity plan, ensure compliance and safeguard business continuity. Yet unlike large enterprises, most don't have the budget to bring a full-time experienced CISO on board.  To bridge this gap, managed service providers (MSPs), managed security service providers (MSSPs), and consulting firms offer virtual CISO (vCISO), or 'CISO-as-a-service' services. The model is simple: instead of hiring a full-time CISO, SMEs and SMBs pay a subscription or a retainer to gain access to expert cyber assistance in the form of a virtual CISO. Staffed by seasoned veteran executives, vCISOs offer C-level assistance in devising and

Ransomware is the de facto threat organizations have faced over the past few years. Threat actors were making easy money by exploiting the high valuation of cryptocurrencies and their victims' lack of adequate preparation.&nbsp;  Think about bad security policies, untested backups, patch management practices not up-to-par, and so forth. It resulted in easy growth for ransomware extortion, a crime that multiple threat actors around the world perpetrate.&nbsp;  Something's changed, though. Crypto valuations have dropped, reducing the monetary appeal of ransomware attacks due to organizations mounting a formidable defense against ransomware.  Threat actors have been searching for another opportunity – and found one. It's called data exfiltration, or exfil, a type of espionage causing headaches at organizations worldwide.

Pentesting and vulnerability scanning are often confused for the same service. The problem is, business owners often use one when they really need the other. Let's dive in and explain the differences.  People frequently confuse penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, and it's easy to see why. Both look for weaknesses in your IT infrastructure by exploring your systems in the same way an actual hacker would. However, there is a very important distinction between the two - and when each is the better option.  Manual or automated?  Penetration testing is a&nbsp; manual&nbsp; security assessment where cyber security professional attempts to find a way to break into your systems. It's a hands-on, in-depth test to evaluate security controls across a variety of systems, including web application, network and cloud environments. This kind of testing could take several weeks to complete, and due to its complexity and cost, is commonly carried out once a year.  Vulnerability scanning,

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Password security is only as strong as the password itself. Unfortunately, we are often reminded of the danger of weak, reused, and compromised passwords with major cybersecurity breaches that start with stolen credentials. For example, in May 2022, the popular wedding planning site, Zola, was the victim of a significant cybersecurity breach where hackers used an attack known as&nbsp; credential stuffing . It resulted in fraudulent activity tied to customer accounts. Let's look at the Zola breach and why it emphasizes the need for organizations to bolster their password security and protect against various types of password attacks.  What happened with the Zola attack?  Instead of going after Zola's core business-critical infrastructure, hackers went after customer accounts with the May attack. Attackers used an age-old technique called&nbsp; credential stuffing &nbsp;to compromise several Zola customer accounts. With access to the compromised accounts, they attempted to purchase gift vouche

Resolving Availability vs. Security, a Constant Conflict in IT<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/resolving-availability-vs-security.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Conflicting business requirements is a common problem – and you find it in every corner of an organization, including in information technology. Resolving these conflicts is a must, but it isn't always easy – though sometimes there is a novel solution that helps.  In IT management there is a constant struggle between security and operations teams. Yes, both teams ultimately want to have secure systems that are harder to breach. However, security can come at the expense of availability – and vice versa. In this article, we'll look at the availability vs. security conflict, and a solution that helps to resolve that conflict.  Ops team focus on availability… security teams lock down  Operations teams will always have stability, and therefore availability, as a top priority. Yes, ops teams will make security a priority too but only as far as it touches on either stability or availability, never as an absolute goal.  It plays out in the "five nines" uptime goal that sets an incredibly high

Phishing incidents are on the rise. A report from IBM  shows that phishing was the most popular attack vector in 2021, resulting in one in five employees falling victim to phishing hacking techniques.  The Need for Security Awareness Training&nbsp;  Although technical solutions protect against phishing threats, no solution is 100% effective . Consequently, companies have no choice but to involve their employees in the fight against hackers. This is where security awareness training comes into play.&nbsp;  Security awareness training gives companies the confidence  that their employees will execute the right response when they discover a phishing message in their inbox.  As the saying goes, "knowledge is power," but the effectiveness of knowledge depends heavily on how it is delivered. When it comes to phishing attacks, simulations are among the most effective forms of training because the events in training simulations directly mimic how an employee would react in the event of an actu

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ransomware is a kind of malware used by cybercriminals to stop users from accessing their systems or files; the cybercriminals then threaten to leak, destroy or withhold sensitive information unless a ransom is paid.  Ransomware attacks can target either the data held on computer systems (known as locker ransomware) or devices (crypto-ransomware). In both instances, once a ransom is paid, threat actors typically provide victims with a decryption key or tool to unlock their data or device, though this is not guaranteed.  Oliver Pinson-Roxburgh, CEO of &nbsp;Defense.com , the all-in-one cybersecurity platform, shares knowledge and advice in this article on how ransomware works, how damaging it can be, and how your business can mitigate ransomware attacks from occurring.  What does a ransomware attack comprise?

The rise of&nbsp; DevOps culture &nbsp;in enterprises has accelerated product delivery timelines. Automation undoubtedly has its advantages. However,&nbsp; containerization and the rise of cloud software development &nbsp;are exposing organizations to a sprawling new attack surface.  Machine identities vastly outnumber human ones in enterprises these days. Indeed, the rise of machine identities is creating cybersecurity debt, and increasing security risks.&nbsp;  Let's take a look at three of the top security risks which machine identities create – and how you can combat them.  Certificate renewal issues  Machine identities are secured differently from human ones. While human IDs can be verified with login and password credentials, machine IDs use certificates and keys. A huge issue with these types of credentials is they have expiration dates.&nbsp;  Generally, certificates remain valid for two years, but the rapid pace of technological improvement has reduced some lifespans to 13 months.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Software vulnerabilities are a major threat to organizations today. The cost of these threats is significant, both financially and in terms of reputation. Vulnerability management and patching can easily get out of hand when the number of vulnerabilities in your organization is in the hundreds of thousands of vulnerabilities and tracked in inefficient ways, such as using Excel spreadsheets or multiple reports, especially when many teams are involved in the organization. Even when a process for patching is in place, organizations still struggle to effectively patch vulnerabilities in their assets. This is generally because teams look at the severity of vulnerabilities and tend to apply patches to vulnerabilities in the following severity order: critical &gt; high &gt; medium &gt; low &gt; info. The following sections explain why this approach is flawed and how it can be improved.  Why is Patching Difficult?  While it is well known that vulnerability patching is extremely important, it

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Insurance exists to protect the insured party against catastrophe, but the insurer needs protection so that its policies are not abused – and that's where the fine print comes in. However, in the case of ransomware insurance, the fine print is becoming contentious and arguably undermining the usefulness of ransomware insurance.  In this article, we'll outline why, particularly given the current climate, war exclusion clauses are increasingly rendering ransomware insurance of reduced value – and why your organization should focus on protecting itself instead.  What is ransomware insurance  In recent years, ransomware insurance has grown as a product field because organizations are trying to buy protection against the catastrophic effects of a successful ransomware attack. Why try to buy insurance? Well, a single, successful attack can just about wipe out a large organization, or lead to crippling costs –&nbsp; NotPetya alone led to a total of $10bn in damages .&nbsp;  Ransomware attacks

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For years, the two most popular methods for internal scanning: agent-based and network-based were considered to be about equal in value, each bringing its own strengths to bear. However, with remote working now the norm in most if not all workplaces, it feels a lot more like agent-based scanning is a must, while network-based scanning is an optional extra.  This article will go in-depth on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, but let's wind it back a second for those who aren't sure why they should even do internal scanning in the first place.  Why should you perform internal vulnerability scanning?  While&nbsp; external vulnerability scanning &nbsp;can give a great overview of what you look like to a hacker, the information that can be gleaned without access to your systems can be limited. Some serious vulnerabilities can be discovered at this stage, so it's a must for many organizations, but that's not where hackers stop.&nbsp;  Techniques like phishing, targeted malware,

BPFDoor &nbsp;is a piece of malware associated with China-based threat actor Red Menshen that has hit mostly Linux operating systems. It's undetected by firewalls and goes unnoticed by most detection systems — so unnoticed that it's been a work in progress over the last five years, going through various phases of development and complexity.  How Does It Work?  BPF stands for Berkley Packet Filters, which is appropriate given that the virus exploits packet filters. BPFDoor uses BPF " sniffers " to see all network traffic and find vulnerabilities. Packet filters are programs that analyze "packets" (files, metadata, network traffic) and permit or dec

Today's modern companies are built on data, which now resides across countless cloud apps. Therefore&nbsp; preventing data loss &nbsp;is essential to your success. This is especially critical for mitigating against rising ransomware attacks — a threat that&nbsp; 57% of security leaders expect to be compromised by within the next year .&nbsp;  As&nbsp; organizations continue to evolve, in turn so does ransomware . To help you stay ahead, Lookout Chief Strategy Officer, Aaron Cockerill met with Microsoft Chief Security Advisor, Sarah Armstrong-Smith to discuss how&nbsp; remote work &nbsp;and the cloud have made it more difficult to spot a ransomware attack, as well as how deploying behavioral-anomaly-based detection can help mitigate ransomware risk.&nbsp; Access the full interview .&nbsp;  Aaron Cockerill: &nbsp;I feel like the way modern enterprises operate, which includes a combination of technologies, has allowed the ransomware to thrive.

If one word could sum up the 2021 infosecurity year (well, actually three), it would be these: "supply chain attack".&nbsp;  A software supply chain attack happens when hackers manipulate the code in third-party software components to compromise the 'downstream' applications that use them. In 2021, we have seen a dramatic rise in such attacks: high profile security incidents like the SolarWinds, Kaseya, and&nbsp; Codecov &nbsp;data breaches have shaken enterprise's confidence in the security practices of third-party service providers.  What does this have to do with secrets, you might ask? In short, a lot. Take the Codecov case (we'll go back to it quickly): it is a textbook example to illustrate how hackers leverage hardcoded credentials to gain initial access into their victims' systems and harvest more secrets down the chain.&nbsp;  Secrets-in-code remains one of the most overlooked vulnerabilities in the application security space, despite being a priority target in hack

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors can gain unauthorized access to users' online accounts via a new technique called "account pre-hijacking," new research has found.  The attack takes aim at the account creation process that's ubiquitous in websites and other online platforms, enabling an adversary to perform a set of actions before an unsuspecting victim creates an account in a target service.  The study was led by independent security researcher Avinash Sudhodanan in collaboration with Andrew Paverd of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).  Pre-hijacking banks on the prerequisite that an attacker is already in possession of a unique identifier associated with a victim, such as an email address or phone number, which can be obtained either from the target's social media accounts or credential dumps circulating on the web.   The attacks can then play out in five different ways, including the use of the same email address during account creation by both the adversary and t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ransomware &nbsp;is not a new attack vector. In fact, the&nbsp; first malware of its kind &nbsp;appeared more than 30 years ago and was distributed via 5.25-inch floppy disks. To pay the ransom, the victim had to mail money to a P.O. Box in Panama.  Fast forward to today, affordable ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) kits are available on the dark web for anyone to purchase and deploy and attackers have an infinite number of channels available to them to infiltrate organizations as a result of reliance on cloud and mobile technologies.  Initiating a ransomware attack is all about discretely gaining access. And as employees can now access your data from anywhere, you have lost visibility into how they do so. To safeguard against these attacks, you're not just looking for malware, you need continuous insights into your users, the endpoints they use and the applications and data they access.

While high-profile cyber-attacks are certainly nothing new, there are several things that make LAPSUS$ unique.   The alleged mastermind of these attacks and several other alleged accomplices were all teenagers.  Unlike more traditional ransomware gangs, LAPSUS$ has a very strong social media presence.  The gang is best known for data exfiltration. It has stolen source code and other proprietary information and has often leaked this information on the Internet.

Security and IT teams are losing sleep as would-be intruders lay siege to the weakest link in any organization's digital defense: employees. By preying on human emotion, social engineering scams inflict billions of dollars of damage with minimal planning or expertise. Cybercriminals find it easier to manipulate people before resorting to technical "hacking" tactics. Recent research reveals that social engineering is leveraged in 98% of attacks.  As the rapid, ongoing acceleration of remote work raises the stakes, security leaders are fighting back with education and awareness. Resources developed by experts, like this new white paper — " Social Engineering: What You Need to Know to Stay Resilient " — identify the most common tactics, track how these types of attacks are evolving, and provide tips to protect organizations and their end-users.

And yet, these very same touchpoints are also often the gateway that hackers and other nefarious users employ in order to steal information, launch attacks and springboard to other criminal activities such as fraud and ransomware.&nbsp;  Successful attacks remain prevalent, even though spending on cybersecurity in most organizations is way up, and even though movements&nbsp; like DevSecOps &nbsp;are shifting security towards those developers who are the lifeblood of business today.

Bad actors continuously evolve their tactics and are becoming more sophisticated. Within the past couple of years, we've seen supply chain attacks that quickly create widespread damage throughout entire industries. But the attackers aren't just focusing their efforts on supply chains. For example, businesses are becoming increasingly more reliant on SaaS apps and the cloud – creating a new avenue for attackers to steal critical data and assets. The looming threat of ransomware attacks, phishing scams, and destructive BEC campaigns has businesses wondering: do I need to increase my security?  As a result, many managed service providers (MSP) are fielding questions about the level of security they can provide for their customers. In this new environment, MSPs are finding they can no longer avoid offering cybersecurity services.

Extended detection and response (XDR) is expected to be the future of cybersecurity, merging security technologies with the evolving approach to the way we do cybersecurity. And while many organizations are scrambling to integrate XDR into their cybersecurity strategies – even more are still trying to figure out what XDR really is and if it's even the right solution for their organization.&nbsp;  But there are some organizations that are getting lost in the debate and are wondering if there is a place for them in this new frontier of cybersecurity: organizations with lean security teams and limited resources.&nbsp;  Fortunately, Cynet, a cybersecurity company, is hosting an upcoming webinar in partnership with Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) that will explore how choosing the right XDR can be impactful for companies lean security teams [ register here ].

Between a series of recent high-profile cybersecurity incidents and the heightened geopolitical tensions, there's rarely been a more dangerous cybersecurity environment. It's a danger that affects every organization – automated attack campaigns don't discriminate between targets.  The situation is driven in large part due to a relentless rise in vulnerabilities, with tens of thousands of brand-new vulnerabilities discovered every year. For tech teams that are probably already under-resourced, guarding against this rising tide of threats is an impossible task.  Yet, in the battle against cybercrime, some of the most effective and most sensible mitigations are sometimes neglected. In this article, we'll outline why cybersecurity risks have escalated so dramatically – and which easy wins your organization can make for a significant difference in your cybersecurity posture, right now.

As a CSIRT consultant, I cannot overemphasize the importance of effectively managing the first hour in a critical incident.  Finding out what to do is often a daunting task in a critical incident. In addition, the feeling of uneasiness often prevents an incident response analyst from making effective decisions. However, keeping a cool head and actions planned out is crucial in successfully handling a security incident. This blog will elaborate on some key points to help readers facilitate better incident response procedures.   Preparation is essential  Before taking on any incidents, security analysts would need to know a great deal of information. To start off, incident response analysts need to familiarize themselves with their roles and responsibilities. IT infrastructure has evolved rapidly over the past years.

The social media company is also planning to release a Firefox plugin to achieve the same level of security across browsers.  The system works with Cloudflare acting as a third-party audit to compare the cryptographic hash of WhatsApp Web's JavaScript code that's shared by Meta with that of a locally computed hash of the code running on the browser client.

The unfortunate truth is that while companies are investing more in cyber defenses and taking cybersecurity more seriously than ever, successful breaches and ransomware attacks are on the rise. While a successful breach is not inevitable, it is becoming more likely despite best efforts to prevent it from happening.&nbsp;  Just as it wasn't raining when Noah built the ark, companies must face the fact that they need to prepare - and educate the organization on - a well-thought-out response plan if a successful cyberattack does occur. Obviously, the worst time to plan your response to a cyberattack is when it happens.  With so many companies falling victim to cyberattacks, an entire cottage industry of Incident Response (IR) services has arisen. Thousands of IR engagements have helped surface best practices and preparedness guides to help those that have yet to fall victim to a cyberattack.&nbsp;  Recently, cybersecurity company Cynet provided an&nbsp; Incident Response plan Word template &nbsp;to help com

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cyber-attacks keep increasing and evolving but, regardless of the degree of complexity used by hackers to gain access, get a foothold, cloak their malware, execute their payload or exfiltrate data, their attack will begin with reconnaissance. They will do their utmost to uncover exposed assets and probe their target's attack surface for gaps that can be used as entry points.  So, the first line of defense is to limit the potentially useful information available to a potential attacker as much as possible. As always, the tug of war between operational necessity and security concerns needs to be taken into account, which requires a better understanding of the type of information typically leveraged.  What information are hackers looking for during recon?  When running recon on an organization, hackers – whether white or black hats - are "casing a joint." To plan their attack, they will try and uncover as much information as possible about:  Your infrastructure   The types

In the midst of 'The Great Resignation,' the damage from employees (or contractors) leaving an organization might be one of the greatest risks facing IT teams today. The reality is that in the busy enterprise computing environment, user onboarding and offboarding is a fact of daily life.&nbsp;  When employee counts range into the five-figure territory — and entire networks of contractors have to be accounted for as well — it's easy to lose track of who's, literally, coming and going. Oftentimes, there are "offboarding" steps that are forgotten about — disabling or removing the user from Active Directory or IAM is not sufficient as the user may have local credentials on some of the SaaS platforms or other sensitive systems.&nbsp;  Technically speaking, there are ways to automate offboarding using protocols such as SCIM and JIT mapping; however, it requires a high level of maturity in an IT environment and the staff to implement it.

With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to impact, and perhaps permanently changing, how we work, cybercriminals again leveraged the distraction in new waves of cyberattacks.  Over the course of 2021 we saw an increase in multiple attack approaches; some old, some new. Phishing and ransomware continued to grow from previous years, as expected, while new attacks on supply chains and cryptocurrencies captured our attention. We also saw an uptick in critical Windows vulnerabilities, again proving that no matter how many vulnerabilities are found, more will always exist.&nbsp;  As we enter 2022, we are seeing novel attacks originating from the conflict in Ukraine, which will certainly make their way into criminal attacks on worldwide businesses.

And all of that means they're trusting the bulk of their privileged business data to those cloud providers, too.  And while most major cloud providers do a decent job of keeping data secure, the majority of business users take an upload-it-and-forget-it approach to their data security needs. And that — needless to say — is dangerous.  In reality, cloud providers can only protect a business's data if the business does its part by adhering to some cloud security best practices.

The increasing volume and sophistication of cyberattacks have naturally led many companies to invest in additional cybersecurity technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The wide-ranging adoption of cloud facilities and the subsequent mushrooming of organizations' networks, combined with the recent migration to remote work, had the direct consequence of a massive expansion of organizations' attack surface and led to a growing number of blind spots in connected architectures.  The unforeseen&nbsp; results of this expanded and attack surface&nbsp; with fragmented monitoring has been a marked increase in the number of successful cyber-attacks, most notoriously, ransomware, but covering a range of other types of attacks as well. The main issues are unmonitored blind spots used by cyber-attackers to breach organizations' infrastructure and escalate their attack or move laterally, seeking valuable information.&nbsp;  The problem lies in discovery. Most organizations have evolved faster than their ability to keep track of all the moving parts involved and to catch up to catalog all past and present assets is often viewed as a complex and resource-heavy task wit

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The subject of threat visibility is a recurring one in cybersecurity. With an expanding attack surface due to the remote work transformation, cloud and SaaS computing and the proliferation of personal devices, seeing all the threats that are continuously bombarding the company is beyond challenging. This especially rings true for small to medium-sized enterprises with limited security budgets and lean IT security teams.  An upcoming webinar ( register here ) tries to help lean security teams understand how to tackle this intractable problem. While adding security solutions to cover blind spots seems logical, the webinar will argue that this just leads to more alarms and more noise. While this approach might be workable for large security teams, smaller teams simply don't have the bandwidth to handle an increase in alerts.  Instead, organizations need broad threat visibility to cover the current blind spots, but then needs the ability to combine, rank and filter alarms by importanc

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Just as animals use their senses to detect danger, cybersecurity depends on sensors to identify signals in the computing environment that may signal danger. The more highly tuned, diverse and coordinated the senses, the more likely one is to detect important signals that indicate danger.  This, however, can be a double-edged sword. Too many signals with too little advanced signal processing just leads to a lot of noise. The right, diverse set of signals with highly evolved signal processing leads to survival. It therefore makes sense that broad threat visibility across the IT environment is fundamental for detecting cyberattacks. Cybersecurity company Cynet puts this in perspective in a new eBook,&nbsp; The Guide for Threat Visibility for Lean IT Security Teams – link to this .  The Ongoing Problem of Limited Threat Visibility  The complexity of today's IT environments has made it exceedingly difficult to protect.

Cyber threats used to be less threatening. While nobody wants their customers' credit card numbers stolen in a data breach, or to see a deranged manifesto plastered over their company website, such incidents can almost seem quaint compared to ransomware attacks that bring all of your critical information systems to a dead halt.  The frequency of these attacks &nbsp;increased more than 150% in the U.S. last year, and in 2021 their global cost is expected to reach $20 billion. Effective, comprehensive security training is essential to mitigating these threats, many of which originate with low-profile phishing or malware attacks to get a foot in the door—attacks that can target anyone who works in your organization.  A company's employees are the front line of defense against cyberattacks, and canned training videos and short quizzes are rarely sufficient to prepare them for this responsibility. The trouble with good training is that it takes not just expertise but time and other reso

As a CISO, one of the most challenging questions to answer is "How well are we protected right now?" Between the acceleration of hackers' offensive capabilities and the dynamic nature of information networks, a drift in the security posture is unavoidable and needs to be continuously compensated. Therefore, answering that question implies continuously validating the security posture and being in a position to check it including, against the latest emerging threats.  Yet, the bulk of cybersecurity is focused on defensive tools. The combination of the rapid evolution of technology and the multiplication of technology layers, combined with the professionalization of the threat landscape, has led to a profusion of cybersecurity tools tackling different security aspects.  Checking the cybersecurity solution stack efficiency is typically done through pen-testing or, more recently, through red teaming – an exercise aimed to map possible loopholes that would lead to a data breac

It is a time when many are thinking of their families and loved ones, time off work, and gift-giving – the holidays. However, while many have their minds outside the realm of work during the holiday season, often, this is when attackers plan their most sinister attacks.&nbsp;  So how can you take precautions to protect your organization during these times?  Why holidays put your company at risk of cyberattack    Attackers today do not have a soft spot for businesses and give companies a break at any time of the year, especially not during holidays. On the contrary, any time of the year where companies may be less prepared to fend off a cyberattack is an opportunity for successful compromise. As a result, the holidays put your company at a higher risk of cyberattack.&nbsp;  Most end-users do not think about cybersecurity when surfing the web or receiving emails with holiday deals during the season. As a result, many let their guard down to a certain degree and become preoccupied and distracted m

If there is one thing the past few years have taught the world, it's that cybercrime never sleeps. For organizations of any size and scope, having around-the-clock protection for their endpoints, networks, and servers is no longer optional, but it's also not entirely feasible for many. Attackers are better than ever at slipping in undetected, and threats are constantly evolving.&nbsp;  Teams can't afford to take a minute off, but they also can't manage the massive security necessary to defend most organizations. A new eBook by XDR provider Cynet ( download here ) breaks down this challenge and offers some solutions for lean security teams looking for ways to improve their detection and response capabilities.&nbsp;  The guide strikes an optimistic tone for lean IT security teams.  Though the challenges are expansive – including talent shortages, an ever-expanding threat surface, and rising security tool prices – organizations can still find smart and effective ways to stay protected 24x7.

The following article is based on a&nbsp; webinar series on enterprise API security by Imvision , featuring expert speakers from IBM, Deloitte, Maersk, and Imvision discussing the importance of centralizing an organization's visibility of its APIs as a way to accelerate remediation efforts and improve the overall security posture.  Centralizing security is challenging in today's open ecosystem  When approaching API visibility, the first thing we have to recognize is that today's enterprises actively avoid managing all their APIs through one system. According to IBM's Tony Curcio, Director of Integration Engineering, many of his enterprise customers already work with hybrid architectures that leverage classic on-premise infrastructure while adopting SaaS and IaaS across various cloud vendors.&nbsp;  These architectures aim to increase resilience and flexibility, but are well aware that it complicates centralization efforts' to: 'These architectures aim to increase resilie

Marvel has been entertaining us for the last 20 years. We have seen gods, super-soldiers, magicians, and other irradiated heroes fight baddies at galactic scales. The eternal fight of good versus evil. A little bit like in cybersecurity, goods guys fighting cybercriminals. If we choose to go with this fun analogy, is there anything useful we can learn from those movies?  World-ending baddies always come with an army  When we watch the different Avenger movies, the first thing we realize is that big baddies never fight alone. Think Ultron and his bot army, Thanos or Loki with the Chitauri. They all come with large, generic clone proxy armies that heroes must fight before getting to the final boss.  In the same way, serious cyberattacks are planned and delivered by organized and structured groups of cybercriminals such as APT groups with sometimes hundreds of members. In real-life scenarios, attacks are coming from IPs (one or many) that have been stolen, hacked, or bought by the crimin

Today's businesses run on data. They collect it from customers at every interaction, and they use it to improve efficiency, increase their agility, and provide higher levels of service. But it's becoming painfully obvious that all of that data businesses collect has also made them an enticing target for cybercriminals.  With each passing day, the evidence of that grows. In the last few months, we've witnessed massive data breaches that targeted &nbsp;Neiman Marcus , &nbsp;Facebook , and the &nbsp;Robinhood &nbsp;stock trading app. And they're hardly alone. In recent years, the number of data breaches worldwide has averaged &nbsp;close to three per day .  That statistic suggests that the average business has a target on its back and is running out of time to mount a defense of its data. And doing so doesn't have to be difficult. To help, here's a simple 5-step framework businesses of all sizes can use to protect their customer data.  Step One: Review and Adapt Data Collection Standards

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In the span of a few years, cryptocurrencies have gone from laughingstock and novelty to a serious financial instrument, and a major sector in high-tech. The price of Bitcoin and Ethereum has gone from single dollars to thousands, and they're increasingly in the mainstream.&nbsp;  This is undoubtedly a positive development, as it opens new avenues for finance, transactions, tech developments, and more. Unfortunately, no innovation is without its dark side, and the crypto industry is no exception. A new webinar from XDR provider Cynet ( you can see it here ) dives deeper into this dark corner to explore the intersection of cybersecurity and cryptocurrency.&nbsp;  The first question is how, exactly, cryptocurrency creates security vulnerabilities for organizations. There's no single answer, and in many cases, the results are more indirect. This bears closer inspection, and the webinar, led by Cynet&nbsp; CyOps Analyst&nbsp; Ronen Ahdut, studies the different ways cryptocurrencies are used by attackers.&nbsp;  I

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Whether it's Office 365, Salesforce, Slack, GitHub or Zoom, all SaaS apps include a host of security features designed to protect the business and its data. The job of ensuring these apps' security settings are properly configured falls on the security team.  The challenge lies within how burdensome this responsibility is — each app has tens or hundreds of security settings to configure, in addition to the continuous need for general or user updates, compounded by many compliance industry standards and frameworks that organizations need to follow.  Not to mention the fact that often the SaaS app owner sits outside the outside of the security team in the department that most uses the app (think Sales has CRM app, Marketing has automation app), and they are untrained and not focused on the security upkeep of the app. It all amounts to just how unrealistic it is to expect security teams to be able to stay in control of the organization's SaaS stack.&nbsp;  That's why Gartner n

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
There is often confusion between Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) and SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) solutions, as both are designed to address security issues within SaaS applications. CASBs protect sensitive data by implementing multiple security policy enforcements to safeguard critical data. For identifying and classifying sensitive information, like Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Intellectual Property (IP), and business records, CASBs definitely help.&nbsp;  However, as the number of SaaS apps increase, the amount of misconfigurations and possible exposure widens and cannot be mitigated by CASBs. These solutions act as a link between users and cloud service providers and can identify issues across various cloud environments. Where CASBs fall short is that they identify breaches&nbsp; after &nbsp;they happen.  When it comes to getting full visibility and control over the organization's SaaS apps, an SSPM solution would be the better choice, as the security team can e

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft 365 (M365), formerly called Office 365 (O365), is Microsoft's cloud strategy flagship product with major changes ahead, such as the deprecation of their legacy authentication protocols.  Often stored on or saved to the device, Basic Authentication protocols rely on sending usernames and passwords with every request, increasing the risk of attackers capturing users' credentials, particularly if not TLS protected. Basic Authentication, while necessary for companies using legacy software, is unable to enforce MFA and is superseded by Modern Authentication.  The legacy settings have been on Microsoft's radar to fix for years. In 2018,&nbsp; Microsoft announced&nbsp; it would introduce a series of changes — and ultimately deprecation — to its authentication controls as a means to help organizations mitigate the risk. These changes were set to take place over a number of years, and in September 2021,&nbsp; they announced &nbsp;that they will begin to permanently disable Basic Auth in all

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
One of the side effects of today's cyber security landscape is the overwhelming volume of data security teams must aggregate and parse. Lean security teams don't have it any easier, and the problem is compounded if they must do it manually. Data and log management are essential for organizations to gain real-time transparency and visibility into security events.&nbsp;  XDR provider Cynet has offered up a new guide ( read it here ) that helps lean organizations understand the importance of centralized log management (CLM). The truth is that even the most well-stocked and staffed teams would have trouble manually handling their log management needs, which is why organizations are increasingly going the automated route.&nbsp;  On top of the efficiency of automation, CLM gives organizations much greater visibility into their environment and security events that impact them. However, the benefits of deploying CLM tools and reducing the level of human intervention in log management and analysis are m

An effective cybersecurity strategy can be challenging to implement correctly and often involves many layers of security. Part of a robust security strategy involves performing what is known as a penetration test (pen test). The penetration test helps to discover vulnerabilities and weaknesses in your security defenses before the bad guys discover these. They can also help validate remedial efforts and solutions put in place to overcome previously discovered security vulnerabilities.&nbsp;  Let's look more closely at the pen test. What is included in a penetration test? How are they performed, and by whom? What steps should be taken after a penetration test?  What is a penetration test? 1 — Simulated cyberattack   A penetration test is, for all practical purposes, a simulated cyberattack on your business. However, it is carried out by the "good guys."

Patching really, really matters – patching is what keeps technology solutions from becoming like big blocks of Swiss cheese, with endless security vulnerabilities punching hole after hole into critical solutions.  But anyone who's spent any amount of time maintaining systems will know that patching is often easier said than done.  Yes, in some instances, you can just run a command line to install that patch, and that's it. These instances are increasingly rare though – given the complexity of the technology environment, you're more likely faced with a complex process to achieve patching best practice.  In this article, we'll outline why database patching matters (yes, databases are vulnerable too!), explain what the problem is with patching databases, and point to a novel solution that takes the pain out of database patching.

The Ultimate SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) Checklist<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/the-ultimate-saas-security-posture.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud security is the umbrella that holds within it: IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. Gartner created the SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) category for solutions that continuously assess security risk and manage the SaaS applications' security posture. With enterprises having 1,000 or more employees relying on dozens to hundreds of apps, the need for deep visibility and remediation for SaaS security settings is only getting more critical.&nbsp;  The top pain points for SaaS security stem from:   Lack of control &nbsp;over the growing SaaS app estate  Lack of governance in the lifecycle &nbsp;of SaaS apps: from purchase to deployment, operation and maintenance  Lack of visibility &nbsp;of all the configurations in SaaS app estate  Skills gap &nbsp;in ever-evolving, accelerating, complex cloud security&nbsp;  Laborious and&nbsp; overwhelming workload&nbsp; to stay on top of hundreds to thousands (to tens of thousands) of settings and permissions.   The capability of governance across the whole SaaS estate is both nuanced and compl

[eBook] The Guide for Reducing SaaS Applications Risk for Lean IT Security Teams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/ebook-guide-for-reducing-saas.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry has gone from novelty to an integral part of today's business world in just a few years. While the benefits to most organizations are clear – more efficiency, greater productivity, and accessibility – the risks that the SaaS model poses are starting to become visible. It's not an overstatement to say that most companies today run on SaaS. This poses an increasing challenge to their security teams.&nbsp;  A new guide from XDR and SSPM provider Cynet, titled The Guide for Reducing SaaS Applications Risk for Lean IT Security Teams ( download here ), breaks down exactly why SaaS ecosystems are so risky, and how security teams can mitigate those dangers.&nbsp;  Today, the average midsize company uses 185 SaaS apps. What this means is that the number of app-to-person connections has risen exponentially. Most midsize companies have nearly 4,406 touch points, creating an attack surface that requires significant resources to simply monitor. The risk of a digital

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Although organizations commonly go to great lengths to address security vulnerabilities that may exist within their IT infrastructure, an organization's helpdesk might pose a bigger threat due to social engineering attacks.  Social engineering is "the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information," according to&nbsp; Webroot . There are many different types of social engineering schemes but one is area of vulnerability is how social engineering might be used against a helpdesk technician to steal a user's credentials.  The Process of Gaining Access With Social Engineering  The first step in such an attack is usually for the attacker to gather information about the organization that they are targeting. The attacker might start by using information that is freely available on the Internet to figure out who within the organization is most likely to have elevated permissions or access to sensitive information. An attacker can often get this information

So, you've been thinking about getting a Penetration Test done on your Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment. Great! What should that involve exactly?&nbsp;  There are many options available, and knowing what you need will help you make your often limited security budget go as far as possible. Broadly, the key focus areas for most penetration tests involving AWS:   Your externally accessible cloud infrastructure  Any application(s) you're building or hosting  Your internal cloud infrastructure  Your AWS configuration itself  Secrets management&nbsp;   We'll look at each one, starting with the most important:  External Infrastructure  The good news here is that, by default, AWS does its best to help you stay secure. For example, the default security groups don't let your EC2 instances receive communication from the outside world unless you actively specify it by adding additional rules.  That said, AWS still allows you plenty of rope to hang yourself with if you're not carefu

Communication is a vital skill for any leader at an organization, regardless of seniority. For security leaders, this goes double. Communicating clearly works on multiple levels. On the one hand, security leaders and CISOs must be able to communicate strategies clearly – instructions, incident response plans, and security policies. On the other, they must be able to communicate the importance of security and the value of having robust defenses to the C-level.&nbsp;  For CISOs and other security leaders, this latter skill is crucial but often overlooked or not prioritized. A new webinar: " How to ace your Infosec board deck ," looks to shed light on both the importance of being able to communicate clearly with management, and key strategies to do so effectively. The webinar will feature a conversation with vCISO and Cybersecurity Consultant Dr. Eric Cole, as well as Norwest Venture Partners General Partner Dave Zilberman.&nbsp;  More so than just talking about the dollar value of a sec

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security teams at mid-sized organizations are constantly faced with the question of "what does success look like?". At ActZero, their continued data-driven approach to cybersecurity invites them to grapple daily with measuring, evaluating, and validating the work they do on behalf of their customers.&nbsp;  Like most, they initially turned toward the standard metrics used in cybersecurity, built around a "Mean Time to X" (MTTX) formula, where X indicates a specific milestone in the attack lifecycle. In this formula, these milestones include factors like Detect, Alert, Respond, Recover, or even Remediate when necessary.  However, as they started to operationalize their unique&nbsp; AI and machine-learning approach , they realized that "speed" measures weren't giving them a holistic view of the story. More importantly, simply measuring just speed wasn't as applicable in an industry where machine-driven alerts and responses were happening in fractions of secon

Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are an essential pillar of an organization's defense, and they must account for a lot. Especially for new CISOs, this can be a daunting task. The first 90 days for a new CISO are crucial in setting up their security team, so there is little time to waste, and much to accomplish.&nbsp;  Fortunately. A new guide by XDR provider Cynet ( download here ) looks to give new and veteran CISOs a durable foundation to build a successful security organization. The challenges faced by new CISOs aren't just logistical.  They include securing their environment from both known and unknown threats, dealing with stakeholders with unique needs and demands, and interfacing with management to show the value of strong security.&nbsp;  Therefore, having clearly defined steps planned out can help CISOs seize the opportunity for change and implement security capabilities that allow organizations to grow and prosper.

How Does DMARC Prevent Phishing?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/how-does-dmarc-prevent-phishing.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
DMARC &nbsp;is a global standard for email authentication. It allows senders to verify that the email really comes from whom it claims to come from. This helps curb spam and phishing attacks, which are among the most prevalent cybercrimes of today. Gmail, Yahoo, and many other large email providers have implemented DMARC and praised its benefits in recent years.  If your company's domain name is bankofamerica.com, you do not want a cyber attacker to be able to send emails under that domain. This puts your brand reputation at risk and could potentially spread financial malware. The DMARC standard prevents this by checking whether emails are sent from an expected IP address or domain. It specifies how domains can be contacted if there are authentication or migration issues and provides forensic information so senders can monitor email traffic and quarantine suspicious emails.  What is a Phishing Attack?  Phishing is an attempt by cybercriminals to trick victims into giving away sensitive

People talk about the cybersecurity job market like it's a monolith, but there are a number of different roles within cybersecurity, depending not only on your skill level and experience but on what you like to do.  In fact, Cybercrime Magazine came up with a list of&nbsp; 50 cybersecurity job titles , while CyberSN, a recruiting organization, came up with its own list of&nbsp; 45 cybersecurity job categories .  Similarly, OnGig.com, a company that helps firms write their job ads, analyzed 150 cybersecurity job titles and came up with its&nbsp; own top 30 list . This article is based on research I did with Springboard, one of the&nbsp; first cybersecurity bootcamps with a job guarantee &nbsp;and 1:1 mentorship.  In particular, CyberSeek.org, a joint industry initiative looking at the cybersecurity job market, offers an&nbsp; interactive list &nbsp;of not only the various positions within cybersecurity but offers you a career path showing how you can get promoted.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For organizations that deal with the defense infrastructure – cybersecurity is more than just a buzzword.  Recently the US Department of Defense (DoD) created a new certification process – the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certificate (CMMC) – to ensure that all its vendors and contractors follow established best cybersecurity practices.  For organizations that work along the DoD supply chain, this means adhering to a strict regulatory framework, which can be quite complex. For one, must ensure that cybersecurity processes and practices are aligned with the type and sensitivity of the information that needs to be protected.  Even though the model is tiered (from "basic cybersecurity hygiene" to "advanced"), organizations will expend a significant effort to ensure they align with the compliance level appropriate for their contracts.  This is why one XDR provider has created a new guide to demonstrate how it helps organizations achieve CMMC compliance ( download the whitepaper here ).  T

Want to take advantage of excellent cloud services? Amazon Web Services may be the perfect solution, but don't forget about AWS security.  Whether you want to use AWS for a few things or everything, you need to protect access to it. Then you can make sure your business can run smoothly.  Read on to learn some important AWS security tips.  Use Multi-Factor authentication  When setting up your AWS security settings or adding new users, you should implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA relies on more than one login factor to grant you access to your account.  For example, when you log in to your account, the program might send a code to your mobile phone. Then you must verify that you have that phone and enter the code to access your account.  MFA is an excellent way to protect your data if someone figures out your username and password. This way, you can still have a layer of protection against the hacker.  Create strong passwords  Even with MFA, you should use strong, uni

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
April is usually a whirlwind month for the cybersecurity industry as it coincides with the release of the highly regarded and influential MITRE ATT&amp;CK test results. The ATT&amp;CK test measures cybersecurity platforms' abilities to detect and react to emulated, multistep attacks that can be used as a barometer of platform effectiveness.&nbsp;  This means that every cybersecurity vendor will be tripping over themselves to push out blog posts, webinars, press releases, and more touting how great their services are and how the results validate their products.  The result is a storm of spin and PR that is hard to navigate. An upcoming webinar offered by Cynet ( register here ) aims to help industry participants differentiate the spin from the real information when it comes to MITRE ATT&amp;CK results.  The Webinar will be led by renowned cybersecurity researcher and Chief Security Strategist for Cynet, Chris Roberts, and Director of Product Marketing for Cynet, George Tubin. The conver

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Data breaches remain a constant threat, and no industry or organization is immune from the risks. From&nbsp; Fortune 500 &nbsp;companies to startups, password-related breaches continue to spread seemingly unchecked.  As a result of the volume of data breaches and cybersecurity incidents, hackers now have access to a vast swathe of credentials that they can use to power various password-related attacks.  One example of this is credential stuffing attacks, which accounted for&nbsp; 1.5 billion &nbsp;incidents in the last quarter of 2020—a staggering 90% increase from Q1 2020.  The rapid pivot to digital in response to the pandemic has been a key contributor to the explosive growth in cybersecurity attacks. With organizations shifting more services online and investing in new applications that facilitate virtual interactions with employees and customers, this has changed the security landscape and presented an array of new avenues for hackers to exploit. However, in a rush to move everything online from mee

How to Fight Business Email Compromise (BEC) with Email Authentication?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/how-to-fight-business-email-compromise.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ever-evolving and rampant form of cybercrime that targets emails as the potential medium to conduct fraud is known as Business Email Compromise.  Targeting commercial, government as well as non-profit organizations, BEC can lead to huge amounts of data loss, security breach, and compromised financial assets.  It is a common misconception that cybercriminals usually lay their focus on MNCs and enterprise-level organizations. SMEs these days are just as much a target to email fraud as the larger industry players.  How Can BEC Affect Organizations?&nbsp;  Examples of BEC include sophisticated social engineering attacks like phishing, CEO fraud, fake invoices, and email spoofing, to name a few. It can also be termed an impersonation attack wherein an attacker aims to defraud a company by posing people in authoritarian positions. Impersonating people like the CFO or CEO, a business partner, or anyone you will blindly place your trust in is what drives these attacks' success.  February of

There are many different types of accounts in a typical Active Directory environment. These include user accounts, computer accounts, and a particular type of account called a&nbsp; service account .&nbsp;  A service account is a special type of account that serves a specific purpose for services, and ultimately, applications in the environment.  These special-purpose Active Directory accounts are also the subject of cybersecurity risks in the environment.  What is a service account? What special privileges does it have on local systems? What cybersecurity risks can relate to service accounts used in the environment? How can IT admins find weak or non-expiring passwords used in Active Directory for service accounts?  What is a Windows service?  As mentioned at the outset, specific Active Directory accounts serve different purposes in Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS).

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platforms have received incredible attention as the platform for security teams.  Whether you're evaluating an EDR for the first time or looking to replace your EDR, as an information security professional, you need to be aware of the gaps prior already to implementation so you can best prepare how to close the gaps.  It's important to understand that each company is unique, and an EDR that a large company uses might not necessarily be the technology that works best when you are leading a small security team, even if you're within the same industry vertical.  Understanding your threat detection technology requirements based on your unique company characteristics will help you choose the right one.&nbsp;  The eBook and webinar "The Dark Side of EDR. Are You Prepared?" helps you in that requirement definition process. It points out the dark side(s) of EDR and provides guidance as to how to overcome them according to your company'

Today's admins certainly have plenty on their plates, and boosting ecosystem security remains a top priority. On-premises, and especially remote, accounts are gateways for accessing critical information.  Password management makes this possible. After all, authentication should ensure that a user is whom they claim to be. This initial layer of security is crucial for protecting one's entire infrastructure.  Unfortunately, the personal nature of passwords has its shortcomings. Passwords are easily forgotten. They may also be too simplistic; many companies don't enforce stringent password-creation requirements. This is where the Active Directory Password Policy comes in.  Additionally, the following is achievable:   Changing user passwords  Recording password changes and storing them within a history log   Active Directory accounts for any impactful changes across user accounts.

We likely all agree that 2020 was a year we won't soon forget - for many reasons. One area particularly impacted last year was (and continues to be) cybersecurity.&nbsp;  While Internet access allowed many businesses to continue functioning during the COVID-19 stay at home requirements, the unprecedented number of people accessing company assets remotely introduced many new challenges for cybersecurity professionals.  With a history of leveraging societal maladies to their advantage, cyber criminals leverage the confusion and unpreparedness created by the global pandemic in their cyber attacks.&nbsp;  In just the last two months of 2020, several high-profile organizations and government entities were successfully attacked using clever approaches that were overlooked by cybersecurity experts. Making sense of how attacks have changed and what new defensive strategies should be taken is no easy task.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity is hard. For a CISO that faces the cyber threat landscape with a small security team, the challenge is compounded.  Compared to CISOs at large enterprises, CISOs small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have smaller teams with less expertise, smaller budgets for technology and outside services, and are more involved in day-to-day protection activities.  CISOs at SMEs are increasingly relying on virtual CISOs (vCISOs) to provide security expertise and guidance. vCISOs are typically former CISOs with years of experience building and managing information security programs across large and small organizations.  Helpful Advice for CISOs with Small Security Teams  Brian Haugli, a well-known vCISO in the US, recently collaborated with cybersecurity company&nbsp; Cynet —which provides autonomous XDR platforms tailored to small security teams—to provide a series of educational videos for CISOs with small security teams with relevant information about their challenges and possible solu
