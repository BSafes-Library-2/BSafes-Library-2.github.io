Password Reset Hack Exposed in Honda's E-Commerce Platform, Dealers Data at Risk<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/password-reset-hack-exposed-in-hondas-e.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security vulnerabilities discovered in Honda's e-commerce platform could have been exploited to gain unrestricted access to sensitive dealer information. "Broken/missing access controls made it possible to access all data on the platform, even when logged in as a test account," security researcher Eaton Zveare&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. The&nbsp; platform &nbsp;is designed for the sale of power equipment, marine, lawn and garden businesses. It does not impact the Japanese company's automobile division. The hack, in a nutshell, exploits a password reset mechanism on one of Honda's sites, Power Equipment Tech Express (PETE), to reset the password associated with any account and obtain full admin-level access. This is made possible due to the fact that the API allows any user to send a password reset request simply by just knowing the username or email address and without having to enter a password tied to that account. Armed with this capability, a malicio

New PowerExchange Backdoor Used in Iranian Cyber Attack on UAE Government<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/new-powerexchange-backdoor-used-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unnamed government entity associated with the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) was targeted by a likely Iranian threat actor to breach the victim's Microsoft Exchange Server with a "simple yet effective" backdoor dubbed&nbsp; PowerExchange . According to a new report from Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, the intrusion relied on email phishing as an initial access pathway, leading to the execution of a .NET executable contained with a ZIP file attachment. The binary, which masquerades as a PDF document, functions as a dropper to execute the final payload, which then launches the backdoor. PowerExchange, written in PowerShell, employs text files attached to emails for command-and-control (C2) communication. It allows the threat actor to run arbitrary payloads and upload and download files from and to the system. The custom implant achieves this by making use of the Exchange Web Services ( EWS ) API to connect to the victim's Exchange Server and uses a mailbox on the server to

A stealthy China-based group managed to establish a persistent foothold into critical infrastructure organizations in the U.S. and Guam without being detected,&nbsp; Microsoft &nbsp;and&nbsp; the "Five Eyes" nations &nbsp;said on Wednesday.

The state-sponsored actor is&nbsp; geared &nbsp;towards espionage and information gathering, with the cluster active since June 2021 and obscuring its intrusion footprint by taking advantage of tools already installed or built into infected machines. Some of the prominent sectors targeted include communications, manufacturing, utility, transportation, construction, maritime, government, information technology, and education.

The threat actors behind the ransomware attack on Taiwanese PC maker MSI last month have leaked the company's private code signing keys on their dark website. "Confirmed, Intel OEM private key leaked, causing an impact on the entire ecosystem," Alex Matrosov, founder and CEO of firmware security firm Binarly,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a tweet over the weekend.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
OpenAI on Friday disclosed that a bug in the Redis open source library was responsible for the exposure of other users' personal information and chat titles in the upstart's ChatGPT service earlier this week. The&nbsp; glitch , which came to light on March 20, 2023, enabled certain users to view brief descriptions of other users' conversations from the chat history sidebar, prompting the company to temporarily shut down the chatbot. "It's also possible that the first message of a newly-created conversation was visible in someone else's chat history if both users were active around the same time," the company&nbsp; said . The bug, it further added, originated in the&nbsp; redis-py library , leading to a scenario where canceled requests could cause connections to be corrupted and return unexpected data from the database cache, in this case, information belonging to an unrelated user. To make matters worse, the San Francisco-based AI research company said it introduce

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Telecommunication providers in the Middle East are the subject of new cyber attacks that commenced in the first quarter of 2023. The intrusion set has been attributed to a Chinese cyber espionage actor associated with a long-running campaign dubbed&nbsp; Operation Soft Cell &nbsp;based on tooling overlaps. "The initial attack phase involves infiltrating Internet-facing Microsoft Exchange servers to deploy web shells used for command execution," researchers from SentinelOne and QGroup said in a&nbsp; new technical report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News. "Once a foothold is established, the attackers conduct a variety of reconnaissance, credential theft, lateral movement, and data exfiltration activities." Operation Soft Cell, according to&nbsp; Cybereason , refers to malicious activities undertaken by China-affiliated actors targeting telecommunications providers since at least 2012. The Soft Cell threat actor, also tracked by Microsoft as&nbsp; Gallium , is known to target unpatched int

Mispadu Banking Trojan Targets Latin America: 90,000+ Credentials Stolen<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/mispadu-banking-trojan-targets-latin.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A banking trojan dubbed&nbsp; Mispadu &nbsp;has been linked to multiple spam campaigns targeting countries like Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Portugal with the goal of stealing credentials and delivering other payloads. The activity, which commenced in August 2022, is currently ongoing, Ocelot Team from Latin American cybersecurity firm Metabase Q said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Mispadu &nbsp;(aka URSA) was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by ESET in November 2019, describing its ability to perpetrate monetary and credential theft and act as a backdoor by taking screenshots and capturing keystrokes. "One of their main strategies is to compromise legitimate websites, searching for vulnerable versions of WordPress, to turn them into their command-and-control server to spread malware from there, filtering out countries they do not wish to infect, dropping different type of malware based on the country being infected," researchers Fernando García and Dan Regalado said.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
2022 was the year when inflation hit world economies, except in one corner of the global marketplace – stolen data. Ransomware payments fell by over 40% in 2022 compared to 2021. More organisations chose not to pay ransom demands, according to findings by blockchain firm Chainalysis. Nonetheless, stolen data has value beyond a price tag, and in risky ways you may not expect. Evaluating stolen records is what&nbsp; Lab 1, a new cyber monitoring platform , believes will make a big difference for long-term cybersecurity resilience. Think of data value this way:&nbsp; Stolen credentials can become future phishing attacks Logins for adult websites are potential extortion attempts Travel and location data are a risk to VIPs and senior leadership, And so on… Hackers could retaliate for non-payment by simply posting their loot to forums where the data will be available for further enrichment and exploitation.&nbsp; Shining a light on dark places Even though your company may not have suffered a di

GoBruteforcer: New Golang-Based Malware Breaches Web Servers Via Brute-Force Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/gobruteforcer-new-golang-based-malware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Golang-based malware dubbed&nbsp; GoBruteforcer &nbsp;has been found targeting web servers running phpMyAdmin, MySQL, FTP, and Postgres to corral the devices into a botnet. "GoBruteforcer chose a Classless Inter-Domain Routing ( CIDR ) block for scanning the network during the attack, and it targeted all IP addresses within that CIDR range," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers&nbsp; said . "The threat actor chose CIDR block scanning as a way to get access to a wide range of target hosts on different IPs within a network instead of using a single IP address as a target." The malware is mainly designed to single out Unix-like platforms running x86, x64 and ARM architectures, with GoBruteforcer attempting to obtain access via a brute-force attack using a list of credentials hard-coded into the binary. If the attack proves to be successful, an internet relay chat ( IRC ) bot is deployed on the victim server to establish communications with an actor-controlled server.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The massive breach at LastPass was the result of one of its engineers failing to update Plex on their home computer, in what's a sobering reminder of the dangers of failing to keep software up-to-date. The embattled password management service last week&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;how unidentified actors leveraged information stolen from an earlier incident that took place prior to August 12, 2022, along with details "available from a third-party data breach and a vulnerability in a third-party media software package to launch a coordinated second attack" between August and October 2022. The intrusion ultimately enabled the adversary to steal partially encrypted password vault data and customer information. The second attack specifically singled out one of the four DevOps engineers, targeting their home computer with a keylogger malware to obtain the credentials and breach the cloud storage environment. This, in turn, is said to have been made possible by exploiting a nearly three-y

LastPass Reveals Second Attack Resulting in Breach of Encrypted Password Vaults<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/lastpass-reveals-second-attack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
LastPass, which in December 2022 disclosed a severe data breach that allowed threat actors to access encrypted password vaults, said it happened as a result of the same adversary launching a second attack on its systems. The company said one of its DevOps engineers had their personal home computer breached and infected with a keylogger as part of a sustained cyber attack that exfiltrated sensitive data from its Amazon AWS cloud storage servers. "The threat actor leveraged information stolen during the first incident, information available from a third-party data breach, and a vulnerability in a third-party media software package to launch a coordinated second attack," the password management service&nbsp; said . This intrusion targeted the company's infrastructure, resources, and one of its employees from August 12, 2022 to October 26, 2022. The original incident, on the other hand, ended on August 12, 2022. The&nbsp; August breach &nbsp;saw the intruders accessing source code and

Popular cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase disclosed that it experienced a cybersecurity attack that targeted its employees. The company&nbsp; said &nbsp;its "cyber controls prevented the attacker from gaining direct system access and prevented any loss of funds or compromise of customer information." The incident, which took place on February 5, 2023, resulted in the exposure of a "limited amount of data" from its directory, including employee names, e-mail addresses, and some phone numbers. As part of the attack, several employees were targeted in an SMS phishing campaign urging them to sign in to their company accounts to read an important message. One employee is said to have fallen for the scam, who entered their username and password in a fake login page set up by the threat actors to harvest the credentials. "After 'logging in,' the employee is prompted to disregard the message and thanked for complying," the company said. "What hap

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Web hosting services provider GoDaddy on Friday disclosed a multi-year security breach that enabled unknown threat actors to install malware and siphon source code related to some of its services. The company attributed the campaign to a "sophisticated and organized group targeting hosting services." GoDaddy said in December 2022, it received an unspecified number of customer complaints about their websites getting sporadically redirected to malicious sites, which it later found was due to the unauthorized third party gaining access to servers hosted in its&nbsp; cPanel environment . The threat actor "installed malware causing the intermittent redirection of customer websites," the company&nbsp; said . The ultimate objective of the intrusions, GoDaddy said, is to "infect websites and servers with malware for phishing campaigns, malware distribution, and other malicious activities."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind the black hat redirect malware campaign have scaled up their campaign to use more than 70 bogus domains mimicking URL shorteners and infected over&nbsp;10,800 websites. "The main objective is still ad fraud by artificially increasing traffic to pages which contain the AdSense ID which contain Google ads for revenue generation," Sucuri researcher Ben Martin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. Details of the malicious activity were&nbsp; first exposed &nbsp;by the GoDaddy-owned company in November 2022. The campaign, which is said to have been active since September last year, is orchestrated to redirect visitors to compromised WordPress sites to fake Q&amp;A portals. The goal, it appears, is to increase the authority of spammy sites in search engine results. "It's possible that these bad actors are simply trying to convince Google that real people from different IPs using different browsers are clicking on their search results," Sucuri noted a

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Popular social news aggregation platform Reddit has disclosed that it was the victim of a security incident that enabled unidentified threat actors to gain unauthorized access to internal documents, code, and some unspecified business systems. The company blamed it on a "sophisticated and highly-targeted phishing attack" that took place on February 5, 2023, aimed at its employees. The attack entailed sending out "plausible-sounding prompts" that redirected to a website masquerading as Reddit's intranet portal in an attempt to steal credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens. A single employee's credentials is said to have been phished in this manner, enabling the threat actor to access Reddit's internal systems. The affected employee self-reported the hack, it further added. The company, however, stressed that there is no evidence to suggest that its production systems were breached or that users' non-public data had been compromise

New Threat: Stealthy HeadCrab Malware Compromised Over 1,200 Redis Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/new-threat-stealthy-headcrab-malware.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
At least 1,200 Redis database servers worldwide have been corralled into a botnet using an "elusive and severe threat" dubbed HeadCrab since early September 2021. "This advanced threat actor utilizes a state-of-the-art, custom-made malware that is undetectable by agentless and traditional anti-virus solutions to compromise a large number of Redis servers," Aqua security researcher Asaf Eitani&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report. A significant concentration of infections has been recorded in China, Malaysia, India, Germany, the U.K., and the U.S. to date. The origins of the threat actor are presently unknown. The findings come two months after the cloud security firm shed light on a Go-based malware codenamed&nbsp; Redigo &nbsp;that has been found compromising Redis servers. The attack is designed to target Redis servers that are exposed to the internet, followed by issuing a&nbsp; SLAVEOF command &nbsp;from another Redis server that's already under the adversary's control.

GitHub on Monday disclosed that unknown threat actors managed to exfiltrate encrypted code signing certificates pertaining to some versions of GitHub Desktop for Mac and Atom apps.

The following versions of GitHub Desktop for Mac have been invalidated: 3.0.2, 3.0.3, 3.0.4, 3.0.5, 3.0.6, 3.0.7, 3.0.8, 3.1.0, 3.1.1, and 3.1.2.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
At least two federal agencies in the U.S. fell victim to a "widespread cyber campaign" that involved the use of legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software to perpetuate a phishing scam. "Specifically, cyber criminal actors sent phishing emails that led to the download of legitimate RMM software – ScreenConnect (now ConnectWise Control) and AnyDesk – which the actors used in a refund scam to steal money from victim bank accounts," U.S. cybersecurity authorities&nbsp; said . The joint advisory comes from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). The attacks, which took place in mid-June and mid-September 2022, have financial motivations, although threat actors could weaponize the unauthorized access for conducting a wide range of activities, including selling that access to other hacking crews.

A massive campaign has infected over 4,500 WordPress websites as part of a long-running operation that's been believed to be active since at least 2017. According to GoDaddy-owned Sucuri, the infections involve the injection of obfuscated JavaScript hosted on a malicious domain named "track[.]violetlovelines[.]com" that's designed to redirect visitors to unwanted sites. The latest&nbsp; operation &nbsp;is said to have been active since December 26, 2022, according to&nbsp; data &nbsp;from urlscan.io. A prior wave seen in&nbsp; early December 2022 &nbsp;impacted more than 3,600 sites, while another set of attacks recorded in&nbsp; September 2022 &nbsp;ensnared more than 7,000 sites. The rogue code is inserted in the WordPress index.php file, with Sucuri noting that it has removed such changes from more than 33,000 files on the compromised sites in the past 60 days.

LastPass-owner GoTo (formerly LogMeIn) on Tuesday disclosed that unidentified threat actors were able to steal encrypted backups of some customers' data along with an encryption key for some of those backups in a November 2022 incident.

A recent IcedID malware attack enabled the threat actor to compromise the Active Directory domain of an unnamed target less than 24 hours after gaining initial access. "Throughout the attack, the attacker followed a routine of recon commands, credential theft, lateral movement by abusing Windows protocols, and executing Cobalt Strike on the newly compromised host," Cybereason researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. IcedID , also known by the name BokBot, started its life as a banking trojan in 2017 before evolving into a&nbsp; dropper for other malware , joining the likes of&nbsp; Emotet ,&nbsp; TrickBot ,&nbsp; Qakbot ,&nbsp; Bumblebee , and&nbsp; Raspberry Robin . Attacks involving the delivery of IcedID have&nbsp; leveraged a variety of methods , especially in the wake of&nbsp; Microsoft's decision to block macros &nbsp;from Office files downloaded from the web.

Cloud services provider Rackspace on Thursday confirmed that the ransomware gang known as Play was responsible for last month's breach. The security incident, which took place on December 2, 2022, leveraged a previously unknown security exploit to gain initial access to the Rackspace Hosted Exchange email environment. "This zero-day exploit is associated with&nbsp; CVE-2022-41080 ," the Texas-based company&nbsp; said . "Microsoft disclosed CVE-2022-41080 as a privilege escalation vulnerability and did not include notes for being part of a remote code execution chain that was exploitable." Rackspace's forensic investigation found that the threat actor accessed the Personal Storage Table ( .PST ) of 27 customers out of a total of nearly 30,000 customers on the Hosted Exchange email environment. However, the company said there is no evidence the adversary viewed, misused, or distributed the customer's emails or data from those personal storage folders. It furt

Medibank on Thursday confirmed that the threat actors behind the&nbsp; devastating cyber attack &nbsp;have posted another dump of data stolen from its systems on the dark web after its refusal to pay a ransom.  "We are in the process of analyzing the data, but the data released appears to be the data we believed the criminal stole," the Australian health insurer&nbsp; said .  "While our investigation continues there are currently no signs that financial or banking data has been taken. And the personal data stolen, in itself, is not sufficient to enable identity and financial fraud. The raw data we have analyzed today so far is incomplete and hard to understand."   The leak comes almost a month after the company acknowledged that personal data belonging to&nbsp; around 9.7 million &nbsp;of its current and former customers were accessed following a ransomware incident in October 2022.

Popular password management service LastPass said it's investigating a second security incident that involved attackers accessing some of its customer information.

GoTo, formerly called LogMeIn, acquired LastPass in October 2015. In December 2021, the Boston-based firm&nbsp; announced &nbsp;plans to spin off LastPass as an independent company.  The digital break-in resulted in the unauthorized third-party leveraging information obtained following a previous breach in August 2022 to access "certain elements of our customers' information."   The August 2022 security event&nbsp; targeted &nbsp;its development environment, leading to the theft of some of its source code and technical information. In September, LastPass&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;the threat actor had access for four days.  The scope of the breach

Iranian Hackers Compromised a U.S. Federal Agency's Network Using Log4Shell Exploit<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/iranian-hackers-compromised-us-federal.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Iranian government-sponsored threat actors have been blamed for compromising a U.S. federal agency by taking advantage of the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server.  The details, which were shared by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), come in response to incident response efforts undertaken by the authority from mid-June through mid-July 2022.  "Cyber threat actors exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server, installed XMRig crypto mining software, moved laterally to the domain controller (DC), compromised credentials, and then implanted Ngrok reverse proxies on several hosts to maintain persistence," CISA&nbsp; noted .  LogShell, aka&nbsp; CVE-2021-44228 , is a critical remote code execution flaw in the widely-used Apache Log4j Java-based logging library. It was addressed by the open source project maintainers in December 2021.   The latest development&nbsp; marks &nbsp;the&nbsp; continued &nbsp; abuse &nbsp;of the Log4j v

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Hundreds of databases on Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) are exposing personal identifiable information (PII), new findings from Mitiga, a cloud incident response company, show.  "Leaking PII in this manner provides a potential treasure trove for threat actors – either during the reconnaissance phase of the cyber kill chain or extortionware/ransomware campaigns," researchers Ariel Szarf, Doron Karmi, and Lionel Saposnik said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.  This includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, marital status, car rental information, and even company logins.   Amazon RDS is a&nbsp; web service &nbsp;that makes it possible to set up relational databases in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It offers support for different database engines such as MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

Researchers Say China State-backed Hackers Breached a Digital Certificate Authority<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/researchers-say-china-state-backed.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected Chinese state-sponsored actor breached a digital certificate authority as well as government and defense agencies located in different countries in Asia as part of an ongoing campaign since at least March 2022.  Symantec, by Broadcom Software, linked the attacks to an adversarial group it tracks under the name&nbsp; Billbug , citing the use of tools previously attributed to this actor. The activity appears to be driven by espionage and data-theft, although no data is said to have been stolen to date.  Billbug , also called Bronze Elgin, Lotus Blossom, Lotus Panda,&nbsp; Spring Dragon , and&nbsp; Thrip , is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that is believed to operate on behalf of Chinese interests. Primary targets include government and military organizations in South East Asia.   Attacks mounted by the adversary in 2019 involved the use of backdoors like&nbsp; Hannotog and Sagerunex , with the intrusions observed in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malicious campaign has compromised&nbsp; over 15,000 WordPress websites &nbsp;in an attempt to redirect visitors to bogus Q&amp;A portals.  "These malicious redirects appear to be designed to increase the authority of the attacker's sites for search engines," Sucuri researcher Ben Martin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week, calling it a "clever black hat SEO trick."  The search engine poisoning technique is designed to promote a "handful of fake low quality Q&amp;A sites" that share similar website-building templates and are operated by the same threat actor.   A notable aspect of the campaign is the ability of the hackers to modify over 100 files per website on average, an approach that contrasts dramatically from other attacks of this kind wherein only a limited number of files are tampered with to reduce footprint and escape detection.  Some of the most commonly infected pages consist of wp-signup.php, wp-cron.php, wp-links-opml.php, wp-settings.php

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
File hosting service Dropbox on Tuesday disclosed that it was the victim of a phishing campaign that allowed unidentified threat actors to gain unauthorized access to 130 of its source code repositories on GitHub.  "These repositories included our own copies of third-party libraries slightly modified for use by Dropbox, internal prototypes, and some tools and configuration files used by the security team," the company&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;in an advisory.  The breach resulted in the access of some API keys used by Dropbox developers as well as "a few thousand names and email addresses belonging to Dropbox employees, current and past customers, sales leads, and vendors."   It, however, stressed that the repositories did not contain source code related to its core apps or infrastructure.  Dropbox, which offers cloud storage, data backup, and document signing services, among others, has over 17.37 million paying users and 700 million registered users as of&nbsp; August 2022 .  The di

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Communication services provider Twilio this week disclosed that it experienced another "brief security incident" in June 2022 perpetrated by the same threat actor behind the&nbsp; August hack &nbsp;that resulted in unauthorized access of customer information.  The security event occurred on June 29, 2022, the company said in an updated advisory shared this week, as part of its probe into the digital break-in.  "In the June incident, a Twilio employee was socially engineered through voice phishing (or 'vishing') to provide their credentials, and the malicious actor was able to access customer contact information for a limited number of customers," Twilio&nbsp; said .   It further said the access gained following the successful attack was identified and thwarted within 12 hours, and that it had alerted impacted customers on July 2, 2022.  The San Francisco-based firm did not reveal the exact number of customers impacted by the June incident, and why the disclosure was made

Chipmaker Intel has confirmed that proprietary source code related to its Alder Lake CPUs has been leaked, following its release by an unknown third-party on 4chan and GitHub last week.  The published content contains Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) code for&nbsp; Alder Lake , the company's 12th generation processors that was originally launched in November 2021.  In a statement shared with Tom's Hardware, Intel&nbsp; said &nbsp;the leak doesn't expose "any new security vulnerabilities as we do not rely on obfuscation of information as a security measure."   It's also encouraging the broader security research community to report any potential issues through its&nbsp; bug bounty program , adding it's reaching out to customers to notify them of the matter.  Besides the UEFI code, the leaked data dump includes a plethora of files and tools, some of which appear to come from firmware vendor Insyde Software.

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) on Monday disclosed it's working to gather "crucial evidence" and that it's collaborating with overseas law enforcement authorities following the hack of telecom provider Optus.  "Operation Hurricane has been launched to identify the criminals behind the alleged breach and to help shield Australians from identity fraud," the AFP&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement.  The development comes after Optus, Australia's second-largest wireless carrier,&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;on September 22, 2022, that it was a victim of a cyberattack. It claimed it "immediately shut down the attack" as soon as it came to light.   The threat actor behind the breach also briefly released a sample of 10,200 records from the breach – putting those users at heightened risk of fraud – in addition to asking for $1 million as part of an extortion demand. The dataset has since been taken down, with the attacker also claiming to have deleted the only copy of the sto

Weeks later, two of them were charged for their actions.

Uber, in an update, said there is "no evidence" that users' private information was compromised in a breach of its internal computer systems that was discovered late Thursday.  "We have no evidence that the incident involved access to sensitive user data (like trip history)," the company&nbsp; said . "All of our services including Uber, Uber Eats, Uber Freight, and the Uber Driver app are operational."  The ride-hailing company also said it's brought back online all the internal software tools it took down previously as a precaution, reiterating it's notified law enforcement of the matter.  It's not immediately clear if the incident resulted in the theft of any other information or how long the intruder was inside Uber's network.  Uber has not provided more specifics of how the incident played out beyond saying its investigation and response efforts are ongoing. But independent security researcher Bill Demirkapi characterized Uber's &amp;qu

Ride hailing giant Uber&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;Thursday it's responding to a cybersecurity incident involving a breach of its network and that it's in touch with law enforcement authorities.  The New York Times first&nbsp; reported &nbsp;the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;The company pointed to its tweeted statement when asked for comment on the matter.   The hack is said to have forced the company to take its internal communications and engineering systems offline as it investigated the extent of the breach.  The publication said the malicious intruder compromised an employee's Slack account, and leveraged it to broadcast a message that the company had "suffered a data breach," in addition to listing internal databases that's supposed to have been compromised.  "It appeared that the hacker was later able to gain access to other internal systems, posting an explicit photo on an internal information page for employees," the New York Times said.

Hacktivist Group GhostSec Compromises 55 Berghof PLCs Across Israel<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/palestinian-hacktivist-group-ghostsec.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hacktivist collective called&nbsp; GhostSec &nbsp;has claimed credit for compromising as many as 55 Berghof programmable logic controllers ( PLCs ) used by Israeli organizations as part of a "Free Palestine" campaign.  Industrial cybersecurity firm OTORIO, which&nbsp; dug deeper &nbsp;into the incident, said the breach was made possible owing to the fact that the PLCs were accessible through the Internet and were secured by trivially guessable credentials.  Details of the compromise first came to light on September 4 after GhostSec shared a video on its Telegram channel demonstrating a successful login to the PLC's admin panel, in addition to dumping data from the hacked controllers.  The Israeli company said the system dumps and screenshots were exported directly from the admin panel following unauthorized access to the controllers through their public IP addresses.   GhostSec (aka Ghost Security), first identified in 2015, is a self-proclaimed&nbsp; vigilante group &nbsp;that was initially formed

While this is not meant to suggest that Shopify customers' passwords have been breached, the fact that so many known breached passwords adhere to Shopify's minimum password requirements does underscore the dangers associated with using weak passwords.

Researchers have identified 1,859 apps across Android and iOS containing hard-coded Amazon Web Services (AWS) credentials, posing a major security risk.  "Over three-quarters (77%) of the apps contained valid AWS access tokens allowing access to private AWS cloud services," Symantec's Threat Hunter team, a part of Broadcom Software, said in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News.  Interestingly, a little more than 50% of the apps were found using the same AWS tokens found in other apps maintained by other developers and companies, indicating a supply chain vulnerability.   "The AWS access tokens could be traced to a shared library, third-party SDK, or other shared component used in developing the apps," the researchers said.  These credentials are typically used for downloading appropriate resources necessary for the app's functions as well as accessing configuration files and authenticating to other cloud services.

Akasa Air, India's newest commercial airline, exposed the personal data belonging to its customers that the company blamed on a technical configuration error.  According to security researcher Ashutosh Barot , the issue is rooted in the account registration process, leading to the exposure of details such as names, gender, email addresses, and phone numbers.  The bug was identified on August 7, 2022, the same day the low-cost airline commenced its operations in the country.   "I found an HTTP request which gave my name, email, phone number, gender, etc. in JSON format," Barot&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up. "I immediately changed some parameters in [the] request and I was able to see other user's PII. It took around ~30 minutes to find this issue."   Upon receiving the report, the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;it temporarily shut down parts of its system to incorporate additional security guardrails. It has also reported the incident to the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Twilio, which earlier this month became a&nbsp; sophisticated phishing attack , disclosed last week that the threat actors also managed to gain access to the accounts of 93 individual users of its Authy two-factor authentication (2FA) service.  The communication tools company&nbsp; said &nbsp;the unauthorized access made it possible for the adversary to register additional devices to those accounts. It has since identified and removed the illegitimately added devices from the impacted accounts.  Authy, acquired by Twilio in February 2015, allows&nbsp; safeguarding online accounts &nbsp;with a second security layer to prevent account takeover attacks. It's estimated to have nearly 75 million users.  Twilio further noted its investigation as of August 24, 2022, turned up 163 affected customers, up from 125 it reported on August 10, whose accounts it said were hacked for a limited period of time.   Besides Twilio, the sprawling campaign, dubbed&nbsp; 0ktapus &nbsp;by Group-IB, is believed to have struck 136 companies,

Hackers Behind Twilio Breach Also Targeted Cloudflare Employees<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/hackers-behind-twilio-breach-also_10.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Web infrastructure company Cloudflare on Tuesday disclosed at least 76 employees and their family members received text messages on their personal and work phones bearing similar characteristics as that of the sophisticated&nbsp; phishing attack against Twilio .  The attack, which transpired around the same time Twilio was targeted, came from four phone numbers associated with T-Mobile-issued SIM cards and was ultimately unsuccessful.  The text messages pointed to a seemingly legitimate domain containing the keywords "Cloudflare" and "Okta" in an attempt to deceive the employees into handing over their credentials.   The wave of over 100 smishing messages commenced less than 40 minutes after the rogue domain was registered via Porkbun, the company noted, adding the phishing page was designed to relay the credentials entered by unsuspecting users to the attacker via Telegram in real-time.   This also meant that the attack could defeat 2FA roadblocks, as the Time-based On

Customer engagement platform Twilio on Monday disclosed that a "sophisticated" threat actor gained "unauthorized access" using an SMS-based phishing campaign aimed at its staff to gain information on a "limited number" of accounts.  The social-engineering attack was bent on stealing employee credentials, the company said, calling the as-yet-unidentified adversary "well-organized" and "methodical in their actions." The incident came to light on August 4.  "This broad based attack against our employee base succeeded in fooling some employees into providing their credentials," it&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a notice. "The attackers then used the stolen credentials to gain access to some of our internal systems, where they were able to access certain customer data."   The communications giant has&nbsp; 268,000 active customer accounts , and counts companies like Airbnb, Box, Dell, DoorDash, eBay, Glassdoor, Lyft, Salesforce, Stripe, Twitter,

Hackers Exploit Twitter Vulnerability to Exposes 5.4 Million Accounts<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/hackers-exploit-twitter-vulnerability.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Twitter on Friday revealed that a now-patched zero-day bug was used to link phone numbers and emails to user accounts on the social media platform.  "As a result of the vulnerability, if someone submitted an email address or phone number to Twitter's systems, Twitter's systems would tell the person what Twitter account the submitted email addresses or phone number was associated with, if any," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory.   Twitter said the bug, which it was&nbsp; made aware &nbsp;of in January 2022, stemmed from a code change introduced in June 2021. No passwords were exposed as a result of the incident.  The six-month delay in making this public stems from new evidence last month that an unidentified actor had potentially taken advantage of the flaw before the fix to scrape user information and sell it for profit on&nbsp; Breach Forums .  Although Twitter didn't reveal the exact number of impacted users, the forum post made by the threat actor shows that the flaw was ex

Slack Resets Passwords After a Bug Exposed Hashed Passwords for Some Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/slack-resets-passwords-after-bug.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Slack said it took the step of resetting passwords for about 0.5% of its users after a flaw exposed salted password hashes when creating or revoking shared invitation links for workspaces.  "When a user performed either of these actions, Slack transmitted a hashed version of their password to other workspace members," the enterprise communication and collaboration platform&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert on 4th August.   Hashing refers to a cryptographic technique that transforms any form of data into a fixed-size output (called a hash value or simply hash).&nbsp; Salting &nbsp;is designed to add an extra security layer to the hashing process to make it resistant to brute-force attempts.  The Salesforce-owned company, which reported more than&nbsp; 12 million daily active users &nbsp;in September 2019, didn't reveal the exact&nbsp; hashing algorithm &nbsp;used to safeguard the passwords.  The bug is said to have impacted all users who created or revoked shared invitation links between 17 April 2017 and 17 July 20

Researchers have uncovered a list of 3,207 apps, some of which can be utilized to gain unauthorized access to Twitter accounts.

Network credentials and virtual private network (VPN) access for colleges and universities based in the U.S. are being advertised for sale on underground and public criminal marketplaces.  "This exposure of sensitive credential and network access information, especially privileged user accounts, could lead to subsequent cyber attacks against individual users or affiliated organizations," the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published last week.   The cyber intrusions against educational institutions involve threat actors leveraging tactics like spear-phishing and ransomware to carry out credential harvesting activities. The gathered credentials are then exfiltrated and sold on Russian cybercrime forums for prices ranging from a few to thousands of U.S. dollars.  Armed with this login information, the agency pointed out, adversaries can proceed to conduct brute-force&nbsp; credential stuffing &nbsp;attacks to break into victim accounts spanning different

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two trojanized Python and PHP packages have been uncovered in what's yet another instance of a software supply chain attack targeting the open source ecosystem.  One of the packages in question is "ctx," a Python module available in the PyPi repository. The other involves "phpass," a PHP package that's been forked on GitHub to distribute a rogue update.  "In both cases the attacker appears to have taken over packages that have not been updated in a while," the SANS Internet Storm Center (ISC)&nbsp; said , one of whose volunteer incident handlers, Yee Ching, analyzed the ctx package.  It's worth noting that ctx was last published to PyPi on December 19, 2014. On the other hand, phpass hasn't received an update since it was uploaded to Packagist on August 31, 2012.  The malicious Python package, which was pushed to PyPi on May 21, 2022, has been&nbsp; removed from the repository , but the PHP library still continues to be&nbsp; available &nbsp;on GitHub.   In b

This involved infecting files such as jquery.min.js and jquery-migrate.min.js with obfuscated JavaScript that's activated on every page load, allowing the attacker to redirect the website visitors to a destination of their choice.  The GoDaddy-owned website security company said that the domains at the end of the redirect chain could be used to load advertisements, phishing pages, malware, or even trigger another set of redirects.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Salesforce-owned subsidiary Heroku on Thursday acknowledged that the theft of GitHub integration OAuth tokens further involved unauthorized access to an internal customer database.  The company, in an&nbsp; updated notification , revealed that a compromised token was abused to breach the database and "exfiltrate the hashed and salted passwords for customers' user accounts."  As a consequence, Salesforce said it's resetting all Heroku user passwords and ensuring that potentially affected credentials are refreshed. It also emphasized that internal Heroku credentials were rotated and extra detections have been put in place.   The attack campaign, which GitHub&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;on April 12, related to an unidentified actor leveraging stolen OAuth user tokens issued to two third-party OAuth integrators, Heroku and Travis-CI, to download data from dozens of organizations, including NPM.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Identity and access management provider Okta on Tuesday said it concluded its probe into the&nbsp; breach &nbsp;of a third-party vendor in late January 2022 by the LAPSUS$ extortionist gang.  Stating that the "impact of the incident was significantly less than the maximum potential impact" the company had previously shared last month, Okta&nbsp; said &nbsp;the intrusion impacted only two customer tenants, down from 366 as was initially assumed.   The&nbsp; security event &nbsp;took place on January 21 when the LAPSUS$ hacking group gained unauthorized remote access to a workstation belonging to a Sitel support engineer. But it only became public knowledge nearly two months later when the adversary&nbsp; posted &nbsp;screenshots of Okta's internal systems on their Telegram channel.  In addition to accessing two active customer tenants within the SuperUser application — which is used to perform basic management functions — the hacker group is said to have viewed limited additional information in other applicatio

Cloud-based repository hosting service GitHub on Friday revealed that it discovered evidence of an unnamed adversary capitalizing on stolen OAuth user tokens to unauthorizedly download private data from several organizations.  "An attacker abused stolen OAuth user tokens issued to two third-party OAuth integrators, Heroku and Travis-CI, to download data from dozens of organizations, including NPM," GitHub's Mike Hanley&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a report.   OAuth access tokens are often&nbsp; used &nbsp;by apps and services to authorize access to specific parts of a user's data and communicate with each other without having to share the actual credentials. It's one of the most common methods used to pass authorization from a single sign-on ( SSO ) service to another application.

Earlier this January, the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team detailed another TDS called&nbsp; Prometheus &nbsp;that has been put to use in different campaigns mounted by cybercriminal groups to distribute Campo Loader, Hancitor, IcedID, QBot, Buer Loader, and SocGholish malware.

Microsoft and Okta Confirm Breach by LAPSUS$ Extortion Group<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/microsoft-and-okta-confirm-breach-by.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Tuesday&nbsp; confirmed &nbsp;that the LAPSUS$ extortion-focused hacking crew had gained "limited access" to its systems, as authentication services provider Okta revealed that nearly 2.5% of its customers have been potentially impacted in the wake of the breach.  "No customer code or data was involved in the observed activities," Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said, adding that the breach was facilitated by means of a single compromised account that has since been remediated to prevent further malicious activity.  The Windows maker, which was already tracking the group under the moniker DEV-0537 prior to the public disclosure,&nbsp; said &nbsp;it "does not rely on the secrecy of code as a security measure and viewing source code does not lead to elevation of risk."  "This public disclosure escalated our action allowing our team to intervene and interrupt the actor mid-operation, limiting broader impact," the company's security

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft and authentication services provider Okta said they are investigating claims of a potential breach alleged by the LAPSUS$ extortionist gang.  The development, which was first reported by&nbsp; Vice &nbsp;and&nbsp; Reuters , comes after the cyber criminal group posted screenshots and source code of what it said were the companies' internal projects and systems on its Telegram channel.  The leaked 37GB archive shows that the group may have accessed the repositories related to Microsoft's Bing, Bing Maps, and Cortana, with the&nbsp; images &nbsp;highlighting Okta's Atlassian suite and in-house Slack channels.   "For a service that powers authentication systems to many of the largest corporations (and FEDRAMP approved) I think these security measures are pretty poor," the hacking cartel wrote on Telegram.  On top of this, the group alleged that it breached LG Electronics (LGE) for the "second time" in a year.  Bill Demirkapi, an independent security researcher,&nbsp; noted &nbsp;th

Samsung on Monday confirmed a security breach that resulted in the exposure of internal company data, including the source code related to its Galaxy smartphones.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Days after the Conti ransomware group broadcasted a pro-Russian message pledging its allegiance to Vladimir Putin's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, a disgruntled member of the cartel has leaked the syndicate's internal chats.  The file dump, published by malware research group&nbsp; VX-Underground , is said to contain 13 months of chat logs between affiliates and administrators of the Russia-affiliated ransomware group from January 2021 to February 2022, in a move that's expected to offer&nbsp; unprecedented &nbsp; insight &nbsp;into the gang's workings.  "Glory to Ukraine," the leaker said in their message.  The leaked conversations show that Conti used fake front companies to attempt to schedule product demos with security firms like CarbonBlack and Sophos to obtain code signing certificates, with the operators working in scrum sprints to complete the software development tasks.   Additionally, the messages&nbsp; confirm &nbsp;the&nbsp; shutdown of the TrickBot botnet &nbsp;last week as well as high

A security flaw has been unearthed in Microsoft's Azure App Service that resulted in the exposure of source code of customer applications written in Java, Node, PHP, Python, and Ruby for at least four years since September 2017.  The vulnerability, codenamed " NotLegit ," was reported to the tech giant by Wiz researchers on October 7, 2021, following which mitigations have been undertaken to fix the information disclosure bug in November. Microsoft&nbsp; said &nbsp;a "limited&nbsp;subset of customers" are at risk, adding "Customers who deployed code to App Service Linux via Local Git after files were already created in the application were the only impacted customers."   The&nbsp; Azure App Service &nbsp;(aka Azure Web Apps) is a cloud computing-based platform for building and hosting web applications.

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Saturday confirmed unidentified threat actors have breached one of its email servers to blast hoax messages about a fake "sophisticated chain attack."  The incident, which was first&nbsp; publicly disclosed &nbsp;by threat intelligence non-profit SpamHaus, involved sending rogue warning emails with the subject line "Urgent: Threat actor in systems" originating from a legitimate FBI email address "eims@ic.fbi[.]gov" that framed the attack on Vinny Troia, a security researcher and founder of dark web intelligence firms Night Lion Security and Shadowbyte, while also claiming him to be affiliated with a hacking outfit named TheDarkOverlord.   SpamHaus cited its own telemetry data to point out that the email blasts happened over two "spam" waves, one shortly before 5:00 a.m. UTC and another one shortly after 7:00 a.m. UTC.&nbsp;  However, according to Kryptos Logic researcher Marcus Hutchins, the goal appears to be

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Friday&nbsp; warned &nbsp;of crypto-mining malware embedded in " UAParser.js ," a popular JavaScript NPM library with over 6 million weekly downloads, days after the NPM repository moved to get rid of three rogue packages that were found to mimic the same library.   The supply-chain attack targeting the open-source library saw three different versions — 0.7.29, 0.8.0, 1.0.0 — that were published with malicious code on Thursday following a successful takeover of the maintainer's NPM account.  "I believe someone was hijacking my NPM account and published some compromised packages (0.7.29, 0.8.0, 1.0.0) which will probably install malware," UAParser.js's developer Faisal Salman&nbsp; said . The issue has been patched in versions 0.7.30, 0.8.1, and 1.0.1.   The development comes days after DevSecOps firm Sonatype disclosed details of three packages —&nbsp; okhsa, klow, and klown &nbsp;— that masqueraded as the user-agent stri

A highly sophisticated adversary named LightBasin has been identified as behind a string of attacks targeting the telecom sector with the goal of collecting "highly specific information" from mobile communication infrastructure, such as subscriber information and call metadata.&nbsp;  "The nature of the data targeted by the actor aligns with information likely to be of significant interest to signals intelligence organizations," researchers from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published Tuesday.  Known to be active as far back as 2016, LightBasin (aka UNC1945) is believed to have compromised 13 telecommunication companies across the world since 2019 by leveraging custom tools and their extensive knowledge of telecommunications protocols for scything through organizations' defenses. The identities of the targeted entities were not disclosed, nor did the findings link the cluster's activity to a specific country.   Indeed, a recent incident in

An unpatched design flaw in the implementation of Microsoft Exchange's Autodiscover protocol has resulted in the leak of approximately 100,000 login names and passwords for Windows domains worldwide.  "This is a severe security issue, since if an attacker can control such domains or has the ability to 'sniff' traffic in the same network, they can capture domain credentials in plain text (HTTP basic authentication) that are being transferred over the wire," Guardicore's Amit Serper&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report.  "Moreover, if the attacker has DNS-poisoning capabilities on a large scale (such as a nation-state attacker), they could systematically syphon out leaky passwords through a large-scale DNS poisoning campaign based on these Autodiscover TLDs [top-level domains]."   The Exchange&nbsp; Autodiscover &nbsp;service enables users to configure applications such as Microsoft Outlook with minimal user input, allowing just a combination of email addresses and pas

More than one terabyte of data containing 5.5 million files has been left exposed, leaking personal information of over 100,000 customers of a Colombian real estate firm, according to cybersecurity company WizCase.  The breach was discovered by Ata Hakçıl and his team in a database owned by Coninsa Ramon  H, a company that specializes in architecture, engineering, construction, and real estate services. "There was no need for a password or login credentials to see this information, and the data was not encrypted," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an exclusive report shared with The Hacker News.   The data exposure is the result of a misconfigured Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket, causing sensitive information such as clients' names, photos, and addresses to be disclosed. The details stored in the bucket range from invoices and income documents to quotes and account statements dating between 2014 and 2021. The complete list of information contained in

In yet another instance of software supply chain attack, unidentified hackers breached the website of&nbsp; MonPass , one of Mongolia's major certificate authorities, to backdoor its installer software with Cobalt Strike binaries.  The trojanized client was available for download between February 8, 2021, and March 3, 2021, said Czech cybersecurity software company Avast in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;published Thursday.  In addition, a public webserver hosted by MonPass was infiltrated potentially as many as eight separate times, with the researchers uncovering eight different web shells and backdoors on the compromised server.   Avast's investigation into the incident began after it discovered the backdoored installer and the implant on one of its customers' systems.

The ransomware cartel that masterminded the&nbsp; Colonial Pipeline attack &nbsp;early last month crippled the pipeline operator's network using a compromised virtual private network (VPN) account password, the latest investigation into the incident has revealed.  The development, which was&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by Bloomberg on Friday, involved gaining an initial foothold into the networks as early as April 29 through the VPN account, which allowed employees to access the company's networks remotely.  The VPN login was unused but active at the time of the attack, the report said, adding the password has since been discovered inside a batch of leaked passwords on the dark web, suggesting that an employee of the company may have reused the same password on another account that was previously breached.

India's flag carrier airline, Air India, has&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a data breach affecting 4.5 million of its customers over a period stretching nearly 10 years after its Passenger Service System (PSS) provider SITA fell victim to a cyber attack earlier this year.  The breach involves personal data registered between Aug. 26, 2011 and Feb. 3, 2021, including details such as names, dates of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance, and Air India frequent flyer data as well as credit card data. But Air India said neither CVV/CVC numbers associated with the credit cards nor passwords were affected.   The airline had previously&nbsp; acknowledged &nbsp;the breach on March 19, stating that "its Passenger Service System provider has informed about a sophisticated cyber attack it was subjected to in the last week of February 2021."  In March, Swiss aviation information technology company SITA&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;it suffered a "highly sophisticated attack&amp;quo

Misconfigurations in multiple Android apps leaked sensitive data of more than 100 million users, potentially making them a lucrative target for malicious actors.  "By not following best-practices when configuring and integrating third-party cloud-services into applications, millions of users' private data was exposed," Check Point researchers said in an analysis published today and shared with The Hacker News.  "In some cases, this type of misuse only affects the users, however, the developers were also left vulnerable. The misconfigurations put users' personal data and developer's internal resources, such as access to update mechanisms, storage, and more at risk."  The findings come from a study of 23 Android applications available in the official Google Play Store, some of which have downloads ranging from 10,000 to 10 million, such as Astro Guru , iFax, Logo Maker , Screen Recorder , and T'Leva .

Cybersecurity company Rapid7 on Thursday revealed that unidentified actors improperly managed to get hold of a small portion of its source code repositories in the aftermath of the software supply chain compromise targeting Codecov earlier this year.  "A small subset of our source code repositories for internal tooling for our [Managed Detection and Response] service was accessed by an unauthorized party outside of Rapid7," the Boston-based firm&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a disclosure. "These repositories contained some internal credentials, which have all been rotated, and alert-related data for a subset of our MDR customers."   On April 15, software auditing startup Codecov alerted customers that its Bash Uploader utility had been infected with a backdoor as early as January 31 by unknown parties to gain access to authentication tokens for various internal software accounts used by developers.

Most mobile app users tend to blindly trust that the apps they download from app stores are safe and secure. But that isn't always the case.  To demonstrate the pitfalls and identify vulnerabilities on a large scale, cybersecurity and machine intelligence company CloudSEK recently provided a platform called&nbsp; BeVigil &nbsp;where individuals can search and check app security ratings and other security issues before installing an app.  A latest&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News detailed how the BeVigil search engine identified over 40 apps - with more than a cumulative 100 million downloads - that had hardcoded private Amazon Web Services (AWS) keys embedded within them, putting their internal networks and their users' data at risk of cyberattacks.  BeVigil finds popular apps leaking AWS keys  The AWS key leakage was spotted in some of the major apps such as Adobe Photoshop Fix, Adobe Comp, Hootsuite, IBM's Weather Channel, and online shopping services Club Factory and Wholee.

3.2 Billion Leaked Passwords Contain 1.5 Million Records with Government Emails<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/32-billion-leaked-passwords-contain-15.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A staggering number of 3.28 billion passwords linked to 2.18 billion unique email addresses were exposed in what's one of the largest data dumps of breached usernames and passwords.  In addition, the leak includes 1,502,909 passwords associated with email addresses from government domains across the world, with the U.S. government alone taking up 625,505 of the exposed passwords, followed by the U.K (205,099), Australia (136,025), Brazil (68,535), and Canada (50,726).  The findings come from an analysis of a massive 100GB data set called "COMB21" — aka Compilation of Many Breaches — that was published for free in an online cybercrime forum earlier this February by putting together data from multiple leaks in different companies and organizations that occurred over the years.   It's worth noting that a leak doesn't imply a breach of public administration systems. The passwords are said to have been obtained via techniques such as password hash cracking after being

An ongoing malvertising campaign tracked as "Tag Barnakle" has been behind the breach of more than 120 ad servers over the past year to sneakily inject code in an attempt to serve malicious advertisements that redirect users to rogue websites, thus exposing victims to scamware or malware.  Unlike other operators who set about their task by infiltrating the ad-tech ecosystem using "convincing personas" to buy space on legitimate websites for running the malicious ads, Tag Barnakle is "able to bypass this initial hurdle completely by going straight for the jugular — mass compromise of ad serving infrastructure,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Confiant security researcher Eliya Stein in a Monday write-up.   The development follows a year after the Tag Barnakle actor was found to have&nbsp; compromised nearly 60 ad servers &nbsp;in April 2020, with the infections primarily targeting an open-source advertising server called Revive.  The latest slew of attacks is no different, although the adve

The maintainers of the PHP programming language have issued an update regarding the security incident that came to light late last month, stating that the actors may have gotten hold of a user database containing their passwords to make unauthorized changes to the repository.  "We no longer believe the git.php.net server has been compromised. However, it is possible that the master.php.net user database leaked," Nikita Popov&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a message posted on its mailing list on April 6.   On March 28, unidentified actors used the names of Rasmus Lerdorf and Popov to&nbsp; push malicious commits &nbsp;to the "php-src" repository hosted on the git.php.net server that involved adding a backdoor to the PHP source code in an instance of a software supply chain attack.  While this was initially treated as a compromise of the git.php.net server, further investigation into the incident has revealed that the commits were a result of pushing them using HTTPS and password-based authenticat

MobiKwik Suffers Major Breach — KYC Data of 3.5 Million Users Exposed<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/mobikwik-suffers-major-breach-kyc-data.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Popular Indian mobile payments service MobiKwik  on Monday came under fire after 8.2 terabytes (TB) of data belonging to millions of its users began circulating on the dark web in the aftermath of a major data breach that came to light earlier this month.  The leaked data includes sensitive personal information such as: customer names, hashed passwords, email addresses, residential addresses, GPS locations, list of installed apps, partially-masked credit card numbers, connected bank accounts and associated account numbers, and know your customer (KYC) documents of 3.5 million users.  Even worse, the leak also shows that MobiKwik does not&nbsp; delete the card information &nbsp;from its servers even after a user has removed them, in what's likely a breach of government regulations.  New guidelines issued by India's apex banking institution, the Reserve Bank of India,&nbsp; prohibit &nbsp;online merchants, e-commerce websites, and payment aggregators from storing card details of a customer online.

In yet another instance of a software supply chain attack,&nbsp;unidentified actors hacked the official Git server of the PHP programming language and pushed unauthorized updates to insert a secret backdoor into its source code.  The two malicious commits were pushed to the self-hosted "php-src" repository hosted on the git.php.net server, illicitly using the names of Rasmus Lerdorf, the author of the programming language, and Nikita Popov, a software developer at Jetbrains.  The changes are said to have been made yesterday on March 28.   "We don't yet know how exactly this happened, but everything points towards a compromise of the git.php.net server (rather than a compromise of an individual git account)," Popov&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an announcement.

Email security firm Mimecast on Tuesday revealed that the state-sponsored SolarWinds hackers who broke into its internal network also downloaded source code out of a limited number of repositories.

Software Supply-Chain Attack Hits Vietnam Government Certification Authority<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/software-supply-chain-attack-hits.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers today disclosed a new supply-chain attack targeting the Vietnam Government Certification Authority (VGCA) that compromised the agency's digital signature toolkit to install a backdoor on victim systems.  Uncovered by Slovak internet security company ESET  early this month, the "SignSight" attack involved modifying software installers hosted on the CA's&nbsp; website &nbsp;("ca.gov.vn") to insert a spyware tool called&nbsp; PhantomNet &nbsp;or Smanager.  According to ESET's telemetry, the breach happened from at least July 23 to August 16, 2020, with the&nbsp; two installers &nbsp;in question — "gca01-client-v2-x32-8.3.msi" and "gca01-client-v2-x64-8.3.msi" for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems — tampered to include the backdoor.   After the attack was reported to VGCA, the certificate authority confirmed that "they were aware of the attack before our notification and that they notified the users who downloaded the trojanized softwar

New Evidence Suggests SolarWinds' Codebase Was Hacked to Inject Backdoor<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/new-evidence-suggests-solarwinds.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The investigation into how the attackers managed to compromise SolarWinds' internal network and poison the company's software updates are still underway, but we may one step close to understanding what appears to be a very meticulously planned and highly-sophisticated supply chain attack.  A new report  published by ReversingLabs today and shared in advance with The Hacker News has revealed that the operators behind the&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;likely managed to compromise the software build and code signing infrastructure of SolarWinds Orion platform as early as October 2019 to deliver the malicious backdoor through its software release process.  "The source code of the affected library was directly modified to include malicious backdoor code, which was compiled, signed, and delivered through the existing software patch release management system," ReversingLabs' Tomislav Pericin said.   Cybersecurity firm FireEye earlier this week&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;how multiple SolarWinds

SolarWinds, the enterprise monitoring software provider who found itself at the epicenter of the most&nbsp; consequential supply chain attacks , said as many as 18,000 of its high-profile customers might have installed a tainted version of its Orion products.  The acknowledgment comes as part of a new filing made by the company to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.  The Texas-based company serves more than 300,000 customers worldwide, including every branch of the US military and four-fifths of the Fortune 500 companies.  The "incident was likely the result of a highly sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by an outside nation state," SolarWinds said in the&nbsp; regulatory disclosure , adding it "currently believes the actual number of customers that may have had an installation of the Orion products that contained this vulnerability to be fewer than 18,000."   The company also reiterated in its&nbsp; security advisory &nbsp;that besides 2019.4 HF 5
