Microsoft on Friday revealed that it was the target of a nation-state attack on its corporate systems that resulted in the theft of emails and attachments from senior executives and other individuals in the company's cybersecurity and legal departments. The Windows maker attributed the attack to a Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) group it tracks as&nbsp; Midnight Blizzard &nbsp;(formerly Nobelium), which is also known as APT29, BlueBravo, Cloaked Ursa, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes. It further said that it immediately took steps to investigate, disrupt, and mitigate the malicious activity upon discovery on January 12, 2024. The campaign is estimated to have commenced in late November 2023. "The threat actor used a&nbsp; password spray attack &nbsp;to compromise a legacy non-production test tenant account and gain a foothold, and then used the account's permissions to access a very small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts, including members of our senior leadership team a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The compromise of Mandiant's X (formerly Twitter) account last week was likely the result of a "brute-force password attack," attributing the hack to a drainer-as-a-service (DaaS) group. "Normally, [two-factor authentication] would have mitigated this, but due to some team transitions and a change in X's 2FA policy , we were not adequately protected," the threat intelligence firm&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post shared on X. The attack, which took place on January 3, 2023,&nbsp; enabled &nbsp;the threat actor to take control of the company's X account and distribute links to a phishing page hosting a cryptocurrency drainer tracked as CLINKSINK. Drainers refer to malicious scripts and smart contracts that facilitate the theft of digital assets from the victim's wallets after they are tricked into approving the transactions. According to the Google-owned subsidiary, multiple threat actors are believed to have leveraged CLINKSINK since December 2023 to siphon funds and tok

MongoDB on Saturday disclosed it's actively investigating a security incident that has led to unauthorized access to "certain" corporate systems, resulting in the exposure of customer account metadata and contact information.

It did not disclose the exact time period of the compromise. In light of the breach, MongoDB recommends that all customers be on the lookout for social engineering and phishing attacks, enforce phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), as well as rotate their MongoDB Atlas passwords.

Crypto hardware wallet maker Ledger published a new version of its " @ledgerhq/connect-kit " npm module after unidentified threat actors pushed malicious code that led to the theft of&nbsp; more than $600,000 &nbsp;in virtual assets.

Software development company Retool has disclosed that the accounts of 27 of its cloud customers were compromised following a targeted and SMS-based social engineering attack. The San Francisco-based firm blamed a&nbsp; Google Account cloud synchronization feature &nbsp;recently introduced in April 2023 for making the breach worse, calling it a "dark pattern." "The fact that Google Authenticator syncs to the cloud is a novel attack vector," Snir Kodesh, Retool's head of engineering,&nbsp; said . "What we had originally implemented was multi-factor authentication. But through this Google update, what was previously multi-factor-authentication had silently (to administrators) become single-factor-authentication." Retool said that the incident, which took place on August 27, 2023, did not allow unauthorized access to on-prem or managed accounts. It also coincided with the company migrating their logins to Okta. It all started with an SMS phishing attack aimed at i

A download manager site served Linux users malware that stealthily stole passwords and other sensitive information for more than three years as part of a supply chain attack. The modus operandi entailed establishing a reverse shell to an actor-controlled server and installing a Bash stealer on the compromised system. The campaign, which took place between 2020 and 2022, is no longer active. "This stealer collects data such as system information, browsing history, saved passwords, cryptocurrency wallet files, as well as credentials for cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Azure)," Kaspersky researchers Georgy Kucherin and Leonid Bezvershenko&nbsp; said . The website in question is freedownloadmanager[.]org, which, according to the Russian cybersecurity firm, offers a legitimate Linux software called "Free Download Manager," but starting in January 2020, began redirecting some users who attempted to download it to another domain deb.fdmpkg[.]

A threat actor called&nbsp; Redfly &nbsp;has been linked to a compromise of a national grid located in an unnamed Asian country for as long as six months earlier this year using a known malware referred to as&nbsp; ShadowPad .

"The attack is the latest in a series of espionage intrusions against [critical national infrastructure] targets." ShadowPad, also known as PoisonPlug, is a follow-up to the PlugX remote access trojan and is a modular implant capable of loading additional plugins dynamically from a remote server as required to harvest sensitive data from breached networks. It has been&nbsp; widely used &nbsp;by a growing list of&nbsp; China-nexus &nbsp; nation-state groups &nbsp;since at least 2019 in attacks aimed at organizations in various industry verticals.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Wednesday revealed that a China-based threat actor known as&nbsp; Storm-0558 &nbsp;acquired the inactive consumer signing key to forge tokens and access Outlook by compromising an engineer's corporate account. This enabled the adversary to access a debugging environment that contained information pertaining to a crash of the consumer signing system and steal the key. The system crash took place in April 2021. "A consumer signing system crash in April of 2021 resulted in a snapshot of the crashed process ('crash dump')," the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post-mortem report. "The crash dumps, which redact sensitive information, should not include the signing key. In this case, a race condition allowed the key to be present in the crash dump. The key material's presence in the crash dump was not detected by our systems." The Windows maker said the crash dump was moved to a debugging environment on the internet-connected corporate network, from where Storm-

Cybersecurity and intelligence agencies from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. on Thursday disclosed details of a mobile malware strain targeting Android devices used by the Ukrainian military.

Some aspects of the malware were&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) earlier in August, highlighting unsuccessful attempts on part of the adversary to penetrate Ukrainian military networks and gather valuable intelligence. It's said that Russian forces captured tablets used by Ukraine on the battlefield, using them as a foothold to remotely disseminate the malware to other devices by using the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ) command-line tool.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing attack likely targeting civil society groups in South Korea has led to the discovery of a novel remote access trojan called&nbsp; SuperBear . The intrusion singled out an unnamed activist, who was contacted in late August 2023 and received a malicious LNK file from an address impersonating a member of the organization, non-profit entity Interlabs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. The LNK file, upon execution, launches a PowerShell command to execute a Visual Basic script that, in turn, fetches the next-stage payloads from a legitimate but compromised WordPress website. This includes the Autoit3.exe binary ("solmir.pdb") and an AutoIt script ("solmir_1.pdb") that's launched using the former. The AutoIt script, for its part, performs process injection using a&nbsp; process hollowing technique , in which malicious code is inserted into a process that's in a suspended state. In this case, an instance of Explorer.exe is spawned to inject a never-before-seen RAT referred to as SuperBear th

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An open-source .NET-based information stealer malware dubbed&nbsp; SapphireStealer &nbsp;is being used by multiple entities to enhance its capabilities and spawn their own bespoke variants. "Information-stealing malware like SapphireStealer can be used to obtain sensitive information, including corporate credentials, which are often resold to other threat actors who leverage the access for additional attacks, including operations related to espionage or ransomware/extortion," Cisco Talos researcher Edmund Brumaghin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. An entire ecosystem has developed over time that allows both financially motivated and nation-state actors to use services from purveyors of stealer malware to carry out various kinds of attacks. Viewed in that light, such malware not only represents an evolution of the cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS) model, they also offer other threat actors to monetize the stolen data to distribute ransomware, conduct data theft, and other maliciou

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hacking outfit nicknamed&nbsp; Earth Estries &nbsp;has been attributed to a new, ongoing cyber espionage campaign targeting government and technology industries based in the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Africa, Germany, and the U.S. "The threat actors behind Earth Estries are working with high-level resources and functioning with sophisticated skills and experience in cyber espionage and illicit activities," Trend Micro researchers Ted Lee, Lenart Bermejo, Hara Hiroaki, Leon M Chang, and Gilbert Sison&nbsp; said . Active since at least 2020, Earth Estries is said to share tactical overlaps with another nation-state group tracked as&nbsp; FamousSparrow , which was first exposed by ESET in 2021 as exploiting ProxyLogon flaws in Microsoft Exchange Server to penetrate hospitality, government, engineering, and legal sectors.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New findings show that malicious actors could leverage a sneaky malware detection evasion technique and bypass endpoint security solutions by manipulating the Windows Container Isolation Framework. The findings were presented by Deep Instinct security researcher Daniel Avinoam at the&nbsp; DEF CON security conference &nbsp;held earlier this month. Microsoft's&nbsp; container architecture &nbsp;(and by extension,&nbsp; Windows Sandbox ) uses what's called a&nbsp; dynamically generated image &nbsp;to separate the file system from each container to the host and at the same time avoid duplication of system files. It's nothing but an "operating system image that has clean copies of files that can change, but links to files that cannot change that are in the Windows image that already exists on the host," thereby bringing down the overall size for a full OS. "The result is images that contain 'ghost files,' which store no actual data but point to a different volume on the system,"

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Android banking trojan dubbed&nbsp; MMRat &nbsp;has been observed targeting mobile users in Southeast Asia since late June 2023 to remotely commandeer the devices and perform financial fraud. "The malware, named after its distinctive package name com.mm.user, can capture user input and screen content, and can also remotely control victim devices through various techniques, enabling its operators to carry out bank fraud on the victim's device," Trend Micro&nbsp; said . What makes MMRat stand apart from others of its kind is the use of a customized command-and-control (C2) protocol based on protocol buffers (aka&nbsp; protobuf ) to efficiently transfer large volumes of data from compromised handsets, demonstrating the growing sophistication of Android malware. Possible targets based on the language used in the phishing pages include Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, and the Philippines.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected Chinese-nexus hacking group exploited a&nbsp; recently disclosed zero-day flaw &nbsp;in Barracuda Networks Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances to breach government, military, defense and aerospace, high-tech industry, and telecom sectors as part of a global espionage campaign. Mandiant, which is tracking the activity under the name&nbsp; UNC4841 , described the threat actor as "highly responsive to defensive efforts" and capable of actively tweaking their modus operandi to maintain persistent access to targets. "UNC4841 deployed new and novel malware designed to maintain presence at a small subset of high priority targets that it compromised either before the patch was released, or shortly following Barracuda's remediation guidance," the Google-owned threat intelligence firm&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new technical report published today. Almost a third of the identified affected organizations are government agencies. Interestingly enough, some of the earliest compromises

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malspam campaign has been observed deploying an off-the-shelf malware called DarkGate . "The current spike in DarkGate malware activity is plausible given the fact that the developer of the malware has recently started to rent out the malware to a limited number of affiliates," Telekom Security&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. The latest report build onn&nbsp; recent findings &nbsp;from security researcher Igal Lytzki, who detailed a "high volume campaign" that leverages hijacked email threads to trick recipients into downloading the malware. The attack commences with a phishing URL that, when clicked, passes through a traffic direction system ( TDS ) to take the victim to an MSI payload subject to certain conditions. This includes the presence of a refresh header in the HTTP response. Opening the MSI file triggers a multi-stage process that incorporates an AutoIt script to execute shellcode that acts as a conduit to decrypt and launch DarkGate via a crypte

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ask any security professional and they'll tell you that remediating risks from various siloed security scanning tools requires a tedious and labor-intensive series of steps focused on deduplication, prioritization, and routing of issues to an appropriate "fixer" somewhere in the organization. This burden on already resource-strapped security teams is an efficiency killer.&nbsp; A new study , commissioned by Seemplicity and conducted by Dark Reading, provides fresh insight into how security pros handle the challenging remediation life cycle from discovery to resolution. The research reveals the obstacles security professionals face when coordinating remediation activities. The data exposes the outcomes — in increased workload and diminished risk posture — that arise from lengthy remediation times, inefficient and uncontrolled manual processes, the lack of managerial visibility and oversight across the risk life cycle.&nbsp; Remediation Process Broken Down to Steps and Time Spent on Each Step

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Unpatched Citrix NetScaler systems exposed to the internet are being targeted by unknown threat actors in what's suspected to be a ransomware attack. Cybersecurity company Sophos is&nbsp; tracking &nbsp;the activity cluster under the moniker&nbsp; STAC4663 . Attack chains involve the exploitation of&nbsp; CVE-2023-3519 , a critical code injection vulnerability impacting NetScaler ADC and Gateway servers that could facilitate unauthenticated remote code execution. In one intrusion detected in mid-August 2023, the security flaw is said to have been used to conduct a domain-wide attack, including injecting payloads into legitimate executables such as the Windows Update Agent (wuauclt.exe) and the Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Service (wmiprvse.exe). An analysis of the payload is underway. Other notable aspects include the distribution of obfuscated PowerShell scripts, PHP web shells, and the use of an Estonian service called BlueVPS for malware staging. Sophos said the modus operandi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning of an increase in adversary-in-the-middle ( AiTM ) phishing techniques, which are being propagated as part of the phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) cybercrime model. In addition to an uptick in AiTM-capable PhaaS platforms, the tech giant noted that existing phishing services like PerSwaysion are incorporating AiTM capabilities. "This development in the PhaaS ecosystem enables attackers to conduct high-volume phishing campaigns that attempt to circumvent MFA protections at scale," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). Phishing kits with AiTM capabilities work in two ways, one of which concerns the use of reverse proxy servers (i.e., the phishing page) to relay traffic to and from the client and legitimate website and stealthily capture user credentials, two-factor authentication codes, and session cookies. A second method involves synchronous relay servers. "In AiTM through synchronous relay s

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a case of privilege escalation associated with a Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) application by taking advantage of an abandoned reply URL. "An attacker could leverage this abandoned URL to redirect authorization codes to themselves, exchanging the ill-gotten authorization codes for access tokens," Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published last week. "The threat actor could then call Power Platform API via a middle-tier service and obtain elevated privileges." Following responsible disclosure on April 5, 2023, the issue was addressed by Microsoft via an update released a day later. Secureworks has also made available an&nbsp; open-source tool &nbsp;that other organizations can use to scan for abandoned reply URLs. Reply URL , also called redirect URI, refers to the location where the authorization server sends the user once the app has been successfully authorized and grant

In yet another sign that developers continue to be targets of software supply chain attacks, a number of malicious packages have been discovered on the Rust programming language's crate registry.

The names of the packages, now taken down, are as follows: postgress, if-cfg, xrvrv, serd, oncecell, lazystatic, and envlogger. It's not clear what the end goal of the campaign was, but the suspicious modules were found to harbor functionalities to capture the operating system information (i.e., Windows, Linux, macOS, or Unknown) and transmit the data to a hard-coded Telegram channel via the messaging platform's API.

An updated version of a botnet malware called&nbsp; KmsdBot &nbsp;is now targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices, simultaneously branching out its capabilities and the attack surface. "The binary now includes support for&nbsp; Telnet scanning &nbsp;and support for more CPU architectures," Akamai security researcher Larry W.

The latest iteration, observed since July 16, 2023, comes months after it emerged that the botnet is being offered as a&nbsp; DDoS-for-hire service &nbsp;to other threat actors. The fact that it's being actively maintained indicates its effectiveness in real-world attacks. KmsdBot was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by the web infrastructure and security company in November 2022. It's mainly designed to target private gaming servers and cloud hosting providers, although it has since set its eyes on some Romanian government and Spanish educational sites.

LockBit 3.0 Ransomware Builder Leak Gives Rise to Hundreds of New Variants<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/lockbit-30-ransomware-builder-leak.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The leak of the&nbsp; LockBit 3.0 ransomware &nbsp;builder last year has led to threat actors abusing the tool to spawn new variants. Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky said it detected a ransomware intrusion that deployed a version of LockBit but with a markedly different ransom demand procedure. "The attacker behind this incident decided to use a different ransom note with a headline related to a previously unknown group, called NATIONAL HAZARD AGENCY," security researchers Eduardo Ovalle and Francesco Figurelli&nbsp; said . The revamped ransom note directly specified the amount to be paid to obtain the decryption keys, and directed communications to a Tox service and email, unlike the LockBit group, which doesn't mention the amount and uses its own communication and negotiation platform. NATIONAL HAZARD AGENCY is far from the only cybercrime gang to use the leaked LockBit 3.0 builder. Some of the other threat actors known to leverage it include&nbsp; Bl00dy and Buhti . Kaspersk

Kroll Suffers Data Breach: Employee Falls Victim to SIM Swapping Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/kroll-suffers-data-breach-employee.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Risk and financial advisory solutions provider Kroll on Friday disclosed that one of its employees fell victim to a "highly sophisticated" SIM swapping attack. The incident, which took place on August 19, 2023, targeted the employee's T-Mobile account, the company said. "Specifically, T-Mobile, without any authority from or contact with Kroll or its employee, transferred that employee's phone number to the threat actor's phone at their request," it&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. This enabled the unidentified actor to gain access to certain files containing personal information of bankruptcy claimants in the matters of BlockFi , FTX , and Genesis. SIM swapping (aka SIM splitting or simjacking), while generally a benign process, could be exploited by threat actors to fraudulently activate a SIM card under their control with a victim's phone number. This makes it possible to intercept SMS messages and voice calls and receive MFA-related messages that cont

Every company has some level of tech debt. Unless you're a brand new start-up, you most likely have a patchwork of solutions that have been implemented throughout the years, often under various leadership teams with different priorities and goals. As those technologies age, they can leave your organization vulnerable to cyber threats. While replacing legacy technologies can be costly, those costs may pale in comparison to a breach – both in terms of immediate financial impact and reputational damage.&nbsp; Here are three ways you can communicate risk to your leadership team as you work to replace legacy infrastructure. 1: Make the Risk Real Leadership teams are driven by quantifiable business implications. The best way to get support for updating or replacing legacy technology is to make the risk to the business real - and measurable - in a language they understand.

A nation-state activity group originating from China has been linked to cyber attacks on dozens of organizations in Taiwan as part of a suspected espionage campaign. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence team is tracking the activity under the name&nbsp; Flax Typhoon , which is also known as Ethereal Panda. "Flax Typhoon gains and maintains long-term access to Taiwanese organizations' networks with minimal use of malware, relying on tools built into the operating system, along with some normally benign software to quietly remain in these networks," the company&nbsp; said . It further said it hasn't observed the group weaponize the access to conduct data-collection and exfiltration. A majority of the targets include government agencies, educational institutions, critical manufacturing, and information technology organizations in Taiwan. A smaller number of victims have also been detected in Southeast Asia, North America, and Africa. The group is suspected to have been active si

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning that Barracuda Networks Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances patched against a recently disclosed critical flaw continue to be at risk of potential compromise from suspected Chinese hacking groups. It also&nbsp; deemed &nbsp;the fixes as "ineffective" and that it "continues to observe active intrusions and considers all affected Barracuda ESG appliances to be compromised and vulnerable to this exploit." Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-2868 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the zero-day bug is said to have been weaponized as early as October 2022, more than seven months before the security hole was plugged. Google-owned Mandiant is tracking the China-nexus activity cluster under the name&nbsp; UNC4841 . The remote command injection vulnerability, impacting versions 5.1.3.001 through 9.2.0.006, allows for unauthorized execution of system commands with administrator privileges on the ESG product.

The North Korea-linked threat actor known as Lazarus Group has been observed exploiting a now-patched critical security flaw impacting Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus to distribute a remote access trojan called such as&nbsp; QuiteRAT . Targets include internet backbone infrastructure and healthcare entities in Europe and the U.S., cybersecurity company Cisco Talos said in a&nbsp; two-part &nbsp; analysis &nbsp;published today. What's more, a closer examination of the adversary's recycled attack infrastructure in its cyber assaults on enterprises has led to the discovery of a new threat dubbed&nbsp; CollectionRAT . The fact that the Lazarus Group continues to rely on the same tradecraft despite those components being well-documented over the years underscores the threat actor's confidence in their operations, Talos pointed out. QuiteRAT is said to be a successor to&nbsp; MagicRAT , itself a follow-up to TigerRAT, while CollectionRAT appears to share overlaps with&nbsp; EarlyRAT &nbsp;(aka&nbsp; Jupiter ), an im

Public Wi-Fi, which has long since become the norm, poses threats to not only individual users but also businesses. With the rise of remote work, people can now work from virtually anywhere: a cafe close to home, a hotel in a different city, or even while waiting for a plane at the airport. Next, let's explore the risks of connecting to public Wi-Fi, both for you personally and for businesses. According to the&nbsp; Forbes Advisor &nbsp;the majority of people (56%) connect to public Wi-Fi networks that don't require a password. This convenience comes at a price, and many are unaware that attackers can steal card details, passwords, and other sensitive information. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: &nbsp;This is one of the most common threats on public Wi-Fi. In an MITM attack, the hacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recently patched security flaw in the popular WinRAR archiving software has been exploited as a zero-day since April 2023, new findings from Group-IB reveal. The vulnerability, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38831 , allows threat actors to spoof file extensions, thereby making it possible to launch malicious scripts contained within an archive that masquerades as seemingly innocuous image or text files. It was addressed in&nbsp; version 6.23 &nbsp;released on August 2, 2023, alongside CVE-2023-40477. In attacks discovered by the Singapore-based firm in July 2023, specially crafted ZIP or RAR archive files distributed via trading-related forums such as Forex Station have been used to deliver a variety of malware families such as DarkMe,&nbsp; GuLoader , and&nbsp; Remcos RAT . "After infecting devices, the cybercriminals withdraw money from broker accounts," Group-IB malware analyst Andrey Polovinkin&nbsp; said , adding as many as 130 traders' devices have been compromised as part of the campaign.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Thousands of&nbsp; Openfire XMPP servers &nbsp;are unpatched against a recently disclosed high-severity flaw and are susceptible to a new exploit, according to a&nbsp; new report &nbsp;from VulnCheck. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-32315 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5), the vulnerability relates to a path traversal vulnerability in Openfire's administrative console that could permit an unauthenticated attacker to access otherwise restricted pages reserved for privileged users. It affects all versions of the software released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0. It was remediated by its developer, Ignite Realtime, earlier this May with the release of versions 4.6.8, 4.7.5, and 4.8.0. "Path traversal protections were already in place to protect against exactly this kind of attack, but didn't defend against certain non-standard URL encoding for UTF-16 characters that were not supported by the embedded web server that was in use at the time," the maintainers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a detailed advisory.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) on Wednesday&nbsp; unsealed an indictment &nbsp;against two founders of the now-sanctioned Tornado Cash cryptocurrency mixer service, charging them with laundering more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds. Both the individuals, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Storm, 34, is said to have been arrested in the U.S. state of Washington. Semenov, 35, remains at large in Dubai. They are alleged to have "made millions of dollars in profits" from promoting and operating the service. Tornado Cash is estimated to have processed upwards of $7 billion worth of crypto assets over a period of three years. In a related move, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned &nbsp;Semenov and&nbsp; eight cryptocurrency addresses &nbsp;connected to him, days after a U.S. cou

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Tuesday warned that threat actors affiliated with North Korea may attempt to cash out stolen cryptocurrency worth more than $40 million. The law enforcement agency&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the blockchain activity to an adversary the U.S. government tracks as TraderTraitor, which is also known by the name Jade Sleet. An investigation undertaken by the FBI found that the group moved approximately 1,580 bitcoin from several cryptocurrency heists over the past 24 hours and are currently said to be holding those funds in six different wallets. North Korea is known to blur the lines among cyber warfare, espionage, and financial crime.&nbsp; TraderTraitor , in particular, has been linked to a series of attacks targeting blockchain and cryptocurrency exchanges with the goal of plundering digital assets to generate illicit revenue for the sanctions-hit nation. This includes the $60 million theft of virtual currency from Alphapo on June 22, 2023; the $37 m

Meta has once again reaffirmed its plans to roll out support for end-to-end encryption ( E2EE ) by default for one-to-one friends and family chats on Messenger by the end of the year. As part of that effort, the social media giant said it's upgrading "millions more people's chats" effective August 22, 2023, exactly seven months after it&nbsp; started gradually expanding the feature &nbsp;to more users in January 2023. The changes are part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's "privacy-focused vision for social networking" that was announced in 2019, although it has since encountered significant technical challenges, causing it to&nbsp; delay its plans &nbsp;by a year. "Like many messaging services, Messenger and Instagram DMs were originally designed to function via servers," Timothy Buck, product manager for Messenger,&nbsp; said . "Meta's servers act as the gateway between the message sender and receiver, what we call the clients." However, the addition of an

A Syrian threat actor named&nbsp; EVLF &nbsp;has been outed as the creator of malware families CypherRAT and CraxsRAT. "These RATs are designed to allow an attacker to remotely perform real-time actions and control the victim device's camera, location, and microphone," Cybersecurity firm Cyfirma&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. CypherRAT and CraxsRAT are said to be offered to other cybercriminals as part of a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) scheme. As many as 100 unique threat actors are estimated to have purchased the twin tools on a lifetime license over the past three years. EVLF is said to be operating a web shop to advertise their warez since at least September 2022. CraxsRAT is billed as an Android trojan that enables a threat actor to remote control an infected device from a Windows computer, with the developer consistently releasing new updates based on feedback from the customers.

A malicious toolset dubbed&nbsp; Spacecolon &nbsp;is being deployed as part of an ongoing campaign to spread variants of the Scarab ransomware across victim organizations globally.

The Slovak cybersecurity firm, which dubbed the threat actor CosmicBeetle, said the origins of the Spacecolon date back to May 2020. The highest concentration of victims has been detected in France, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and Turkey. While the exact provenance of the adversary is unclear, several Spacecolon variants are said to contain Turkish strings, likely pointing to the involvement of a Turkish-speaking developer.

A&nbsp; new State of SaaS Security Posture Management Report &nbsp;from SaaS cybersecurity provider&nbsp; AppOmni &nbsp;indicates that Cybersecurity, IT, and business leaders alike recognize SaaS cybersecurity as an increasingly important part of the cyber threat landscape. And at first glance, respondents appear generally optimistic about their SaaS cybersecurity. Over 600 IT, cybersecurity, and business leaders at companies between 500-2,500+ employees were surveyed and responded with confidence in their SaaS cybersecurity preparedness and capabilities. For example: When asked to rate the SaaS cybersecurity maturity level of their organizations, 71% noted that their organizations' SaaS cybersecurity maturity has achieved either a mid-high level (43%) or the highest level (28%). For the security levels of the SaaS applications authorized for use in their organization, sentiment was similarly high. Seventy-three percent rated SaaS application security as mid-high (41%) or the highest maturity level (

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented threat cluster has been linked to a software supply chain attack targeting organizations primarily located in Hong Kong and other regions in Asia. The Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, is tracking the activity under its insect-themed moniker Carderbee. The attacks, per the cybersecurity firm, leverage a trojanized version of a legitimate software called EsafeNet Cobra DocGuard Client to deliver a known backdoor called&nbsp; PlugX &nbsp;(aka Korplug) on victim networks. "In the course of this attack, the attackers used malware signed with a legitimate Microsoft certificate," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The use of Cobra DocGuard Client to pull off a supply chain attack was previously highlighted by ESET in its&nbsp; quarterly Threat Report &nbsp;this year, detailing a September 2022 intrusion in which an unnamed gambling company in Hong Kong was compromised via a malicious update pushed by the software.

A new variant of an&nbsp; Apple macOS malware &nbsp;called&nbsp; XLoader &nbsp;has surfaced in the wild, masquerading its malicious features under the guise of an office productivity app called "OfficeNote." "The new version of XLoader is bundled inside a standard Apple disk image with the name OfficeNote.dmg," SentinelOne security researchers Dinesh Devadoss and Phil Stokes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday analysis. "The application contained within is signed with the developer signature MAIT JAKHU (54YDV8NU9C)." XLoader , first detected in 2020, is&nbsp; considered &nbsp;a successor to Formbook and is an information stealer and keylogger offered under the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model. A macOS variant of the malware emerged in July 2021, distributed as a Java program in the form of a compiled .JAR file. "Such files require the Java Runtime Environment, and for that reason the malicious .jar file will not execute on a macOS install out of the box, since Apple stopped shipping JRE with

Software services provider Ivanti is&nbsp; warning &nbsp;of a new critical zero-day flaw impacting Ivanti Sentry (formerly MobileIron Sentry) that it said is being actively exploited in the wild, marking an escalation of its security woes.

"If exploited, this vulnerability enables an unauthenticated actor to access some sensitive APIs that are used to configure the Ivanti Sentry on the administrator portal (port 8443, commonly MICS)," the company&nbsp; said . "While the issue has a high CVSS score, there is a low risk of exploitation for customers who do not expose port 8443 to the internet."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; added &nbsp;a critical security flaw in Adobe ColdFusion to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. The vulnerability, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-26359 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), relates to a deserialization flaw present in Adobe ColdFusion 2018 (Update 15 and earlier) and ColdFusion 2021 (Update 5 and earlier) that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user without requiring any interaction. Deserialization &nbsp;(aka unmarshaling) refers to the process of reconstructing a data structure or an object from a byte stream. But when it's performed without validating its source or sanitizing its contents, it can lead to&nbsp; unexpected consequences &nbsp;such as code execution or denial-of-service (DoS). It was&nbsp; patched &nbsp;by Adobe as part of updates issued in March 2023. As of writing, it's immediately not clear how the flaw is being&nbsp; abused in the wil

How to Investigate an OAuth Grant for Suspicious Activity or Overly Permissive Scopes<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/how-to-investigate-oauth-grant-for.html"> Full Text</a>

From a user's perspective, OAuth works like magic. In just a few keystrokes, you can whisk through the account creation process and gain immediate access to whatever new app or integration you're seeking. Unfortunately, few users understand the implications of the permissions they allow when they create a new OAuth grant, making it easy for malicious actors to manipulate employees into giving away unintended access to corporate environments. In one of the&nbsp; highest-profile examples , Pawn Storm's attacks against the Democratic National Convention and others leveraged OAuth to target victims through social engineering.&nbsp; Security and IT teams would be wise to establish a practice of reviewing new and existing OAuth grants programmatically to catch risky activity or overly-permissive scopes. And, there are new solutions for&nbsp; SaaS security &nbsp;cropping up that can make this process easier. Let's take a look at some best practices for prioritizing and investigating your organization's grants

Threat actors are leveraging access to malware-infected Windows and macOS machines to deliver a proxy server application and use them as exit nodes to reroute proxy requests. According to AT&amp;T Alien Labs, the unnamed company that offers the proxy service operates more than 400,000 proxy exit nodes, although it's not immediately clear how many of them were co-opted by malware installed on infected machines without user knowledge and interaction. "Although the proxy website claims that its exit nodes come only from users who have been informed and agreed to the use of their device," the cybersecurity company&nbsp; said &nbsp;it found evidence where "malware writers are installing the proxy silently in infected systems." Multiple malware families have been observed delivering the proxy to users searching for cracked software and games.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind the HiatusRAT malware have returned from their hiatus with a new wave of reconnaissance and targeting activity aimed at Taiwan-based organizations and a U.S. military procurement system. Besides recompiling malware samples for different architectures, the artifacts are said to have been hosted on new virtual private servers (VPSs), Lumen Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. The cybersecurity firm described the activity cluster as "brazen" and "one of the most audacious," indicating no signs of slowing down. The identity and the origin of the threat actors are presently unknown. Targets included commercial firms, such as semiconductor and chemical manufacturers, and at least one municipal government organization in Taiwan as well as a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) server associated with submitting and retrieving proposals for defense contracts.

WoofLocker Toolkit Hides Malicious Codes in Images to Run Tech Support Scams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/wooflocker-toolkit-hides-malicious.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed an updated version of an advanced fingerprinting and redirection toolkit called&nbsp; WoofLocker &nbsp;that's engineered to conduct tech support scams. The sophisticated traffic redirection scheme was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Malwarebytes in January 2020, leveraging JavaScript embedded in compromised websites to perform anti-bot and web traffic filtering checks to serve next-stage JavaScript that redirects users to a browser locker (aka browlock). This redirection mechanism, in turn, makes use of steganographic tricks to conceal the JavaScript code within a PNG image that's served only when the validation phase is successful. Should a user be detected as a bot or not interesting traffic, a decoy PNG file without the malicious code is used. WoofLocker is also known as 404Browlock due to the fact that visiting the browlock URL directly without the appropriate redirection or one-time session token results in a 404 error page.

Networking hardware company Juniper Networks has released an "out-of-cycle" security update to address multiple flaws in the J-Web component of Junos OS that could be combined to achieve remote code execution on susceptible installations. The four vulnerabilities have a cumulative CVSS rating of 9.8, making them Critical in severity. They affect all versions of Junos OS on SRX and EX Series. "By chaining exploitation of these vulnerabilities, an unauthenticated, network-based attacker may be able to remotely execute code on the devices," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory released on August 17, 2023. The J-Web interface allows users to configure, manage, and monitor Junos OS devices. A brief description of the flaws is as follows - CVE-2023-36844 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-36845 &nbsp;(CVSS scores: 5.3) - Two PHP external variable modification vulnerabilities in J-Web of Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX Series and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are using Android Package (APK) files with unknown or unsupported compression methods to elude malware analysis. That's according to findings from Zimperium, which found 3,300 artifacts leveraging such compression algorithms in the wild. 71 of the identified samples can be loaded on the operating system without any problems. There is no evidence that the apps were available on the Google Play Store at any point in time, indicating that the apps were distributed through other means, typically via untrusted app stores or social engineering to trick the victims into sideloading them. The APK files use "a technique that limits the possibility of decompiling the application for a large number of tools, reducing the possibilities of being analyzed," security researcher Fernando Ortega&nbsp; said . "In order to do that, the APK (which is in essence a ZIP file), is using an unsupported decompression method." The advantage of such an approach is its abilit

14 Suspected Cybercriminals Arrested Across Africa in Coordinated Crackdown<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/14-suspected-cybercriminals-arrested.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coordinated law enforcement operation across 25 African countries has led to the arrest of 14 suspected cybercriminals, INTERPOL&nbsp; announced &nbsp;Friday. The exercise, conducted in partnership with AFRIPOL, enabled investigators to identify 20,674 cyber networks that were linked to financial losses of more than $40 million. "The four-month Africa Cyber Surge II operation was launched in April 2023 and focused on identifying cybercriminals and compromised infrastructure," the agency said. As part of the operation, three suspects were arrested in Cameroon in connection with an online scam involving the fraudulent sale of works of art worth $850,000. Another suspect was arrested in Nigeria for defrauding a Gambian victim. Also arrested were two money mules linked to scams initiated through messaging platforms. The cyber networks comprised 3,786 command-and-control (C2) servers, 14,134 victim IP addresses tied to data stealer infections, 1,415 phishing links and domains, 939

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
While IT security managers in companies and public administrations rely on the concept of Zero Trust, APTS (Advanced Persistent Threats) are putting its practical effectiveness to the test. Analysts, on the other hand, understand that Zero Trust can only be achieved with comprehensive insight into one's own network.&nbsp; Just recently, an attack believed to be perpetrated by the Chinese hacker group&nbsp; Storm-0558 &nbsp;targeted several government agencies. They used fake digital authentication tokens to access webmail accounts running on Microsoft's Outlook service. In this incident, the attackers stole a signing key from Microsoft, enabling them to issue functional access tokens for Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Outlook.com and to download emails and attachments. Due to a plausibility check error, the digital signature, which was only intended for private customer accounts (MSA), also worked in the Azure Active Directory for business customers.&nbsp; Embracing the Zero Trust Revolution Acc

A new "mass-spreading" social engineering campaign is targeting users of the Zimbra Collaboration email server with an aim to collect their login credentials for use in follow-on operations. The activity, active since April 2023 and still ongoing, targets a wide range of small and medium businesses and governmental entities, most of which are located in Poland, Ecuador, Mexico, Italy, and Russia. It has not been attributed to any known threat actor or group. "Initially, the target receives an email with a phishing page in the attached HTML file," ESET researcher Viktor Šperka&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "The email warns the target about an email server update, account deactivation, or similar issue and directs the user to click on the attached file."

Microsoft on Thursday disclosed that it found a new version of the&nbsp; BlackCat &nbsp;ransomware (aka ALPHV and Noberus) that embeds tools like Impacket and RemCom to facilitate lateral movement and remote code execution. "The&nbsp; Impacket tool &nbsp;has credential dumping and remote service execution modules that could be used for broad deployment of the BlackCat ransomware in target environments," the company's threat intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). "This BlackCat version also has the&nbsp; RemCom hacktool &nbsp;embedded in the executable for remote code execution. The file also contains hardcoded compromised target credentials that actors use for lateral movement and further ransomware deployment." RemCom, billed as an open-source alternative to PsExec, has been put to use by Chinese and Iranian nation-state threat actors like&nbsp; Dalbit &nbsp;and&nbsp; Chafer &nbsp;(aka Remix Kitten) to move across the victim environments in the past.

Google has announced plans to add a new feature in the upcoming version of its Chrome web browser to alert users when an extension they have installed has been removed from the Chrome Web Store. The feature, set for release alongside Chrome 117, allows users to be notified when an add-on has been unpublished by a developer, taken down for violating Chrome Web Store policy, or marked as malware. The tech giant said it intends to highlight such extensions under a "Safety check" category in the "Privacy and security" section of the browser settings page. "When a user clicks 'Review,' they will be taken to their extensions and given the choice to either remove the extension or hide the warning if they wish to keep the extension installed," Oliver Dunk, a developer relations engineer for Chrome extensions,&nbsp; said .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undetected attack method called&nbsp; NoFilter &nbsp;has been found to abuse the Windows Filtering Platform ( WFP ) to achieve privilege escalation in the Windows operating system. "If an attacker has the ability to execute code with admin privilege and the target is to perform&nbsp; LSASS Shtinkering , these privileges are not enough," Ron Ben Yizhak, a security researcher at Deep Instinct, told The Hacker News. "Running as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" is required. The techniques described in this research can escalate from admin to SYSTEM." The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;were presented at the DEF CON security conference over the weekend. The starting point of the&nbsp; research &nbsp;is an in-house tool called RPC Mapper the cybersecurity company used to map remote procedure call ( RPC ) methods, specifically those that invoke&nbsp; WinAPI , leading to the discovery of a method named "BfeRpcOpenToken," which is part of WFP.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have documented a novel post-exploit persistence technique on iOS 16 that could be abused to fly under the radar and maintain access to an Apple device even when the victim believes it is offline. The method "tricks the victim into thinking their device's Airplane Mode works when in reality the attacker (following successful device exploit) has planted an artificial Airplane Mode which edits the UI to display Airplane Mode icon and cuts internet connection to all apps except the attacker application," Jamf Threat Labs researchers Hu Ke and Nir Avraham said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Airplane Mode , as the name implies, allows users to turn off wireless features in their devices, effectively preventing them from connecting to Wi-Fi networks, cellular data, and Bluetooth as well as sending or receiving calls and text messages. The approach devised by Jamf, in a nutshell, provides an illusion to the user that the Airplane Mode is

A new, financially motivated operation dubbed&nbsp; LABRAT &nbsp;has been observed weaponizing a now-patched critical flaw in GitLab as part of a cryptojacking and proxyjacking campaign. "The attacker utilized undetected signature-based tools, sophisticated and stealthy cross-platform malware, command-and-control (C2) tools which bypassed firewalls, and kernel-based rootkits to hide their presence," Sysdig&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Furthermore, the attacker abused a legitimate service,&nbsp; TryCloudflare , to obfuscate their C2 network." Proxyjacking &nbsp;allows the attacker to rent the compromised host out to a proxy network, making it possible to monetize the unused bandwidth. Cryptojacking, on the other hand, refers to the abuse of the system resources to mine cryptocurrency. A notable aspect of the campaign is the use of compiled binaries written in Go and .NET to fly under the radar, with LABRAT also providing backdoor access to the infected systems.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hitherto undocumented threat actor operating for nearly a decade and codenamed&nbsp; MoustachedBouncer has been attributed to cyber espionage attacks aimed at foreign embassies in Belarus. "Since 2020, MoustachedBouncer has most likely been able to perform adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks at the ISP level, within Belarus, in order to compromise its targets," ESET security researcher Matthieu Faou&nbsp; said , describing the group as skilled and advanced. The adversary, active since at least 2014, is assessed to be aligned with Belarusian interests, likely employing a lawful interception system such as&nbsp; SORM &nbsp;to conduct its AitM attacks as well as deploy disparate tools called NightClub and Disco. Both the Windows malware frameworks support additional spying plugins including a screenshotter, an audio recorder, and a file stealer. The oldest sample of NightClub dates back to November 19, 2014, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal from Ukraine. Embassy staff from four differ

Google has announced plans to add support for quantum-resistant encryption algorithms in its Chrome browser, starting with version 116. "Chrome will begin supporting&nbsp; X25519Kyber768 &nbsp;for establishing symmetric secrets in&nbsp; TLS , starting in Chrome 116, and available behind a flag in Chrome 115," Devon O'Brien&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post published Thursday.

The encryption algorithm has already been adopted by&nbsp; Cloudflare ,&nbsp; Amazon Web Services , and IBM. X25519Kyber768 is a hybrid algorithm that combines the output of&nbsp; X25519 , an elliptic curve algorithm widely used for key agreement in TLS, and Kyber-768 to create a strong session key to encrypt TLS connections.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Chinese threat actor known as APT31 (aka Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, or Violet Typhoon) has been linked to a set of advanced backdoors that are capable of exfiltrating harvested sensitive information to Dropbox. The malware is part of a broader collection of&nbsp; more than 15 implants &nbsp;that have been put to use by the adversary in attacks targeting industrial organizations in Eastern Europe in 2022. "The attackers aimed to establish a permanent channel for data exfiltration, including data stored on air-gapped systems," Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis spotlighting APT31's previously undocumented tradecraft. The intrusions employ a three-stage malware stack, each focused on disparate aspects of the attack chain: setting up persistence, gathering sensitive data, and transmitting the information to a remote server under the threat actor's control. Some variants of the second-stage backdoors also come with features designed to look up file names in the Microso

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been linked to a cyber attack on a power generation company in southern Africa with a new variant of the SystemBC malware called DroxiDat as a precursor to a suspected ransomware attack. "The proxy-capable backdoor was deployed alongside Cobalt Strike Beacons in a south African nation's critical infrastructure," Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT),&nbsp; said . The Russian cybersecurity company said the attack, which took place in late March 2023, was in its early stages and involved the use of DroxiDat to profile the system and proxy network traffic using the&nbsp; SOCKS5 protocol &nbsp;to and from command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. SystemBC &nbsp;is a C/C++-based commodity malware and remote administrative tool that was&nbsp; first seen in 2019 . Its main feature is to set up&nbsp; SOCKS5 proxies &nbsp;on victim computers that can then be used by threat actors to tunnel malicious traffic associ

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; added &nbsp;a recently patched security flaw in Microsoft's .NET and Visual Studio products to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation.

It was&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;by Microsoft as part of its August 2023 Patch Tuesday updates shipped earlier this week, tagging it with an "Exploitation More Likely" assessment. While exact details surrounding the nature of exploitation are unclear, the Windows maker has acknowledged the existence of a proof-of-concept (PoC) in its advisory. It also said that attacks leveraging the flaw can be pulled off without any additional privileges or user interaction.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors are using a legitimate Rust-based injector called&nbsp; Freeze[.]rs &nbsp;to deploy a commodity malware called XWorm in victim environments. The novel attack chain, detected by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs on July 13, 2023, is initiated via a phishing email containing a booby-trapped PDF file. It has also been used to introduce Remcos RAT by means of a crypter called SYK Crypter, which was first documented by Morphisec in May 2022. "This file redirects to an HTML file and utilizes the 'search-ms' protocol to access an LNK file on a remote server," security researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . "Upon clicking the LNK file, a PowerShell script executes Freeze[.]rs and SYK Crypter for further offensive actions." Freeze[.]rs, released on May 4, 2023, is a&nbsp; open-source red teaming tool &nbsp;from Optiv that functions as a payload creation tool used for circumventing security solutions and executing shellcode in a stealthy manner.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Attackers continue to target Microsoft identities to gain access to connected Microsoft applications and federated SaaS applications. Additionally, attackers continue to progress their attacks in these environments, not by exploiting vulnerabilities, but by abusing native Microsoft functionality to achieve their objective. The attacker group Nobelium, linked with the SolarWinds attacks, has been documented using native functionality like the creation of Federated Trusts&nbsp; [1] &nbsp;to enable persistent access to a Microsoft tenant. This article demonstrates an additional native functionality that when leveraged by an attacker enables persistent access to a Microsoft cloud tenant and lateral movement capabilities to another tenant. This attack vector enables an attacker operating in a compromised tenant to abuse a misconfigured Cross-Tenant Synchronization (CTS) configuration and gain access to other connected tenants or deploy a rogue CTS configuration to maintain persistence within the te

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A widely used Chinese language input app for Windows and Android has been found vulnerable to serious security flaws that could allow a malicious interloper to decipher the text typed by users. The findings from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which carried out an analysis of the encryption mechanism used in Tencent's Sogou Input Method , an app that has over 455 million monthly active users across Windows, Android, and iOS. The vulnerabilities are rooted in EncryptWall, the service's custom encryption system, allowing network eavesdroppers to extract the textual content and access sensitive data. "The Windows and Android versions of Sogou Input Method contain vulnerabilities in this encryption system, including a vulnerability to a CBC&nbsp; padding oracle attack , which allow network eavesdroppers to recover the plaintext of encrypted network transmissions, revealing sensitive information including what users have typed," the researchers&nbsp; said .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are increasingly using a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit dubbed EvilProxy to pull off account takeover attacks aimed at high-ranking executives at prominent companies. According to Proofpoint, an ongoing hybrid campaign has leveraged the service to target thousands of Microsoft 365 user accounts, sending approximately 120,000 phishing emails to hundreds of organizations worldwide between March and June 2023. Nearly 39% of the hundreds of compromised users are said to be C-level executives, including CEOs (9%) and CFOs (17%). The attacks have also singled out personnel with access to financial assets or sensitive information. At least 35% of all compromised users had additional account protections enabled. The campaigns are seen as a response to the increased adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in enterprises, prompting threat actors to evolve their tactics to bypass new security layers by incorporating adversary-in-the-middle ( AitM ) phishing kits to

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Interpol has announced the takedown of a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform called 16Shop, in addition to the arrests of three individuals in Indonesia and Japan. 16Shop specialized in the sales of phishing kits that other cybercriminals can purchase to mount phishing attacks on a large scale, ultimately facilitating the theft of credentials and payment details from users of popular services such as Apple, PayPal, American Express, Amazon, and Cash App, among others. "Victims typically receive an email with a pdf file or link that redirects to a site requesting the victims' credit card or other personally identifiable information," Interpol&nbsp; said . "This information is then stolen and used to extract money from the victims." No less than 70,000 users across 43 countries are estimated to have been compromised via services offered on 16Shop. The law enforcement operation has also led to the arrest of the site's administrator, a 21-year-old Indonesian

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a trio of side-channel attacks that could be exploited to leak sensitive data from modern CPUs. Called&nbsp; Collide+Power &nbsp;( CVE-2023-20583 ),&nbsp; Downfall &nbsp;( CVE-2022-40982 ), and&nbsp; Inception &nbsp;( CVE-2023-20569 ), the novel methods follow the disclosure of another newly discovered security vulnerability affecting AMD's Zen 2 architecture-based processors known as&nbsp; Zenbleed &nbsp;(CVE-2023-20593). "Downfall attacks target a critical weakness found in billions of modern processors used in personal and cloud computers,"&nbsp; Daniel Moghimi , senior research scientist at Google,&nbsp; said . "This vulnerability [...] enables a user to access and steal data from other users who share the same computer." In a hypothetical attack scenario, a malicious app installed on a device could weaponize the method to steal sensitive information like passwords and encryption keys, effectively undermining Intel's Software Guard eXtensions ( SGX

Validate security continuously across your full stack with Pen Testing as a Service. In today's modern security operations center (SOC), it's a battle between the defenders and the cybercriminals. Both are using tools and expertise – however, the cybercriminals have the element of surprise on their side, and a host of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that have evolved. These external threat actors have now been further emboldened in the era of AI with open-source tools like ChatGPT. With the potential of an attack leading to a breach within minutes, CISOs now are looking to prepare all systems and assets for cyber resilience and rapid response when needed. With tools and capabilities to validate security continuously – including penetration testing as a service – DevSecOps teams can remediate critical vulnerabilities fast due to the easy access to tactical support to the teams that need it the most.

Google has introduced a new security feature in Android 14 that allows IT administrators to disable support for 2G cellular networks in their managed device fleet. The search giant said it's introducing a second user setting to turn off support, at the model level, for&nbsp; null-ciphered cellular connections . "The Android Security Model assumes that all networks are hostile to keep users safe from network packet injection, tampering, or eavesdropping on user traffic," Roger Piqueras Jover, Yomna Nasser, and Sudhi Herle&nbsp; said . "Android does not rely on link-layer encryption to address this threat model. Instead, Android establishes that all network traffic should be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)." 2G networks, in particular, employ weak encryption and lack mutual authentication,&nbsp; rendering &nbsp;them&nbsp; susceptible &nbsp;to over-the-air interception and traffic decryption attacks by impersonating a real 2G tower.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.K. Electoral Commission on Tuesday disclosed a "complex" cyber attack on its systems that went undetected for over a year, allowing the threat actors to access years worth of voter data belonging to 40 million people. "The incident was identified in October 2022 after suspicious activity was detected on our systems," the regulator&nbsp; said . "It became clear that hostile actors had first accessed the systems in August 2021." The intrusion enabled unauthorized access to the Commission's servers hosting email, control systems, and copies of the electoral registers it maintains for research purposes. The identity of the intruders are presently unknown. The registers included the name and address of anyone in the U.K. who registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, as well as the names of those registered as overseas voters. However, they did not contain information of those who qualified to register anonymously and addresses of overseas electors regi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Exposed Kubernetes (K8s) clusters are being exploited by malicious actors to deploy cryptocurrency miners and other backdoors. Cloud security firm Aqua, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News, said a majority of the clusters belonged to small to medium-sized organizations, with a smaller subset tied to bigger companies, spanning financial, aerospace, automotive, industrial, and security sectors. In total, Kubernetes clusters belonging to more than 350 organizations, open-source projects, and individuals were discovered, 60% of which were the target of an active crypto-mining campaign. The publicly-accessible clusters, per Aqua, are said to suffer from two different kinds of misconfigurations: allowing anonymous access with high privileges and running kubectl proxy with the flags "--address=`0.0.0.0` --accept-hosts `.*`" "Housing a wide array of sensitive and valuable assets, Kubernetes clusters can store customer data, financial records, intellectual property, a

Tactical similarities have been unearthed between the double extortion ransomware group known as Rhysida and Vice Society , including in their targeting of education and healthcare sectors. "As Vice Society was observed deploying a variety of commodity ransomware payloads, this link does not suggest that Rhysida is exclusively used by Vice Society, but shows with at least medium confidence that Vice Society operators are now using Rhysida ransomware," Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. Vice Society , tracked by Microsoft under the name Storm-0832, has a&nbsp; pattern &nbsp;of employing already existing ransomware binaries that are sold on criminal forums to pull off their attacks. The financially motivated gang has also been observed resorting to pure extortion-themed attacks wherein the data is exfiltrated without encrypting them.

The operators associated with the QakBot (aka QBot) malware have set up 15 new command-and-control (C2) servers as of late June 2023. The findings are a continuation of the malware's infrastructure analysis from Team Cymru, and arrive a little over two months after Lumen Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that 25% of its C2 servers are only active for a single day. "QakBot has a history of taking an extended break each summer before returning sometime in September, with this year's spamming activities ceasing around 22 June 2023," the cybersecurity firm&nbsp; said . "But are the QakBot operators actually on vacation when they aren't spamming, or is this 'break' a time for them to refine and update their infrastructure and tools?" QakBot's C2 network, like in the case of Emotet and IcedID, is&nbsp; characterized &nbsp;by a tiered architecture in which C2 nodes communicate with upstream Tier 2 (T2) C2 nodes hosted on VPS providers geolocated in Russia.

Hackers Abusing Cloudflare Tunnels for Covert Communications<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/hackers-abusing-cloudflare-tunnels-for.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has revealed that threat actors are abusing Cloudflare Tunnels to establish covert communication channels from compromised hosts and retain persistent access. "Cloudflared is functionally very similar to ngrok," Nic Finn, a senior threat intelligence analyst at GuidePoint Security, said . "However, Cloudflared differs from ngrok in that it provides a lot more usability for free, including the ability to host TCP connectivity over cloudflared." A command-line tool for Cloudflare Tunnel, cloudflared allows users to create secure connections between an origin web server and Cloudflare's nearest data center so as to hide the web server IP addresses as well as block volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and brute-force login attacks. For a threat actor with elevated access on an infected host, this feature presents a lucrative approach to set up a foothold by generating a token required to establish the tunnel from the victim machine.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Introduced in 1999, Microsoft Active Directory is the default identity and access management service in Windows networks, responsible for assigning and enforcing security policies for all network endpoints. With it, users can access various resources across networks. As things tend to do, times, they are a'changin' – and a few years back, Microsoft introduced Azure Active Directory, the cloud-based version of AD to extend the AD paradigm, providing organizations with an Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solution across both the cloud and on-prem apps. (Note that as of July 11th 2023, this service was renamed to&nbsp; Microsoft Entra ID , but for the sake of simplicity, we'll refer to it as Azure AD in this post) Both Active Directory and Azure AD are critical to the functioning of on-prem, cloud-based, and hybrid ecosystems, playing a key role in uptime and business continuity.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor is using a variant of the Yashma ransomware to target various entities in English-speaking countries, Bulgaria, China, and Vietnam at least since June 4, 2023. Cisco Talos, in a new write-up, attributed the operation with moderate confidence to an adversary of likely Vietnamese origin. "The threat actor uses an uncommon technique to deliver the ransom note," security researcher Chetan Raghuprasad&nbsp; said . "Instead of embedding the ransom note strings in the binary, they download the ransom note from the actor-controlled GitHub repository by executing an embedded batch file." Yashma,&nbsp; first described &nbsp;by the BlackBerry research and intelligence team in May 2022, is a rebranded version of another ransomware strain called Chaos. A month prior to its emergence, the Chaos ransomware builder was leaked in the wild. A notable aspect of the ransom note is its resemblance to the well-known WannaCry ransomware, possibly done so in an attempt to obs

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a set of 11 living-off-the-land binaries-and-scripts ( LOLBAS ) that could be maliciously abused by threat actors to conduct post-exploitation activities.&nbsp; "LOLBAS is an attack method that uses binaries and scripts that are already part of the system for malicious purposes," Pentera security researcher Nir Chako&nbsp; said . "This makes it hard for security teams to distinguish between legitimate and malicious activities, since they are all performed by trusted system utilities." To that end, the Israeli cybersecurity company said it uncovered nine LOLBAS downloaders and three executors that could enable adversaries to download and execute "more robust malware" on infected hosts. This includes: MsoHtmEd.exe, Mspub.exe, ProtocolHandler.exe, ConfigSecurityPolicy.exe, InstallUtil.exe, Mshta.exe, Presentationhost.exe, Outlook.exe, MSAccess.exe, scp.exe, and sftp.exe.&nbsp; "In a complete attack chain, a hacker will us

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware campaign has been observed making use of malicious OpenBullet configuration files to target inexperienced cyber criminals with the goal of delivering a remote access trojan (RAT) capable of stealing sensitive information. Bot mitigation company Kasada&nbsp; said &nbsp;the activity is designed to "exploit trusted criminal networks," describing it as an instance of advanced threat actors "preying on beginner hackers." OpenBullet &nbsp;is a legitimate&nbsp; open-source pen testing tool &nbsp;used for automating credential stuffing attacks. It takes in a&nbsp; configuration file &nbsp;that's tailored to a specific website and can combine it with a password list procured through other means to log successful attempts. "OpenBullet can be used with Puppeteer, which is a headless browser that can be used for automating web interactions," the company&nbsp; said .

In today's interconnected world, evolving security solutions to meet growing demand is more critical than ever. Collaboration across multiple solutions for intelligence gathering and information sharing is indispensable. The idea of multiple-source intelligence gathering stems from the concept that threats are rarely isolated. Hence, their detection and prevention require a comprehensive understanding of the broader landscape. A comprehensive and robust security framework should be established by aggregating resources, knowledge, and expertise from various sources. This collaborative effort allows for the analysis of diverse data sets, the identification of emerging patterns, and the timely dissemination of crucial information.&nbsp; In this article, we discuss a versatile security platform that can operate in two distinct roles within a security ecosystem. This platform can function as a subscriber, actively collecting and aggregating security data from various endpoints and other so

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics has devised a "deep learning-based acoustic side-channel attack" that can be used to classify laptop keystrokes that are recorded using a nearby phone with 95% accuracy. "When trained on keystrokes recorded using the video conferencing software Zoom, an accuracy of 93% was achieved, a new best for the medium," researchers Joshua Harrison, Ehsan Toreini, and Maryam Mehrnezhad&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new study published last week. Side-channel attacks&nbsp; refer &nbsp;to a class of&nbsp; security exploits &nbsp;that aim to glean insights from a system by monitoring and measuring its physical effects during the processing of sensitive data. Some of the common observable effects include runtime behavior, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, acoustics, and cache accesses.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Vulnerable&nbsp; Redis services &nbsp;have been targeted by a "new, improved, dangerous" variant of a malware called SkidMap that's engineered to target a wide range of Linux distributions. "The malicious nature of this malware is to adapt to the system on which it is executed," Trustwave security researcher Radoslaw Zdonczyk&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. Some of the Linux distribution SkidMap sets its eyes on include Alibaba, Anolis, openEuler, EulerOS, Stream, CentOS, RedHat, and Rocky. SkidMap was&nbsp; first disclosed &nbsp;by Trend Micro in September 2019 as a cryptocurrency mining botnet with capabilities to load malicious kernel modules that can obfuscate its activities as well as monitor the miner process. The operators of the malware have also been found camouflaging their backup command-and-control (C2) IP address on the Bitcoin blockchain, evocative of another botnet malware known as&nbsp; Glupteba .

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning about cyber crooks masquerading as legitimate non-fungible token (NFT) developers to steal cryptocurrency and other digital assets from unsuspecting users. In these fraudulent schemes, criminals either obtain direct access to NFT developer social media accounts or create look-alike accounts to promote "exclusive" new NFT releases, often employing misleading advertising campaigns that create a sense of urgency to pull them off. "Links provided in these announcements are phishing links directing victims to a spoofed website that appears to be a legitimate extension of a particular NFT project," the FBI&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory last week. The replica websites urge potential targets to connect their cryptocurrency wallets and purchase the NFT, only for the threat actors to siphon the funds and NFTs to wallets under their control.

Managed Detection and Response (MDR) has emerged as a crucial solution for organizations looking to bolster their security measures. MDR allows businesses to outsource the management of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) products deployed across their network domain. With real-time threat-hunting capabilities, MDR services detect and mitigate malicious activities on individual endpoints while promptly alerting the service provider's Security Operations Center (SOC) for further investigation. By leveraging the expertise of security specialists, MDR services relieve organizations of the complexities and criticality associated with security operations. Types of MDR Solutions: MDR services come in various forms, tailored to an organization's technology environment and risk requirements.&nbsp; These include: Bring-Your-Own Security Stack / Hybrid Solution: MDR solutions that integrate with existing security products deployed within an environment.

Reptile Rootkit: Advanced Linux Malware Targeting South Korean Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/reptile-rootkit-advanced-linux-malware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are using an open-source rootkit called&nbsp; Reptile &nbsp;to target Linux systems in South Korea. "Unlike other rootkit malware that typically only provide concealment capabilities, Reptile goes a step further by offering a reverse shell, allowing threat actors to easily take control of systems," the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. "Port knocking is a method where the malware opens a specific port on an infected system and goes on standby. When the threat actor sends a magic packet to the system, the received packet is used as a basis to establish a connection with the C&amp;C server." A rootkit is a malicious software program that's designed to provide privileged, root-level access to a machine while concealing its presence. At least four different campaigns have leveraged Reptile since 2022. The first use of the rootkit was&nbsp; recorded &nbsp;by Trend Micro in May 2022 in connection with an intrusion

Microsoft on Friday disclosed that it has addressed a critical security flaw impacting Power Platform , but not before it came under criticism for its failure to swiftly act on it. "The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to Custom Code functions used for Power Platform custom connectors," the tech giant&nbsp; said . "The potential impact could be unintended information disclosure if secrets or other sensitive information were embedded in the Custom Code function." The company further noted that no customer action is required and that it found no evidence of active exploitation of the vulnerability in the wild. Tenable, which initially discovered and reported the shortcoming to Redmond on March 30, 2023,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the problem could enable limited, unauthorized access to cross-tenant applications and sensitive data.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new high-severity security flaw in PaperCut print management software for Windows that could result in remote code execution under specific circumstances. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-39143 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.4), the flaw impacts PaperCut NG/MF prior to version 22.1.3. It has been described as a combination of a path traversal and file upload vulnerability. "CVE-2023-39143 enables unauthenticated attackers to potentially read, delete, and upload arbitrary files to the PaperCut MF/NG application server, resulting in remote code execution in certain configurations," Horizon3.ai's Naveen Sunkavally&nbsp; said . The cybersecurity firm said that file upload leading to remote code execution is possible when the external device integration setting is enabled, which is on by default in some installations of PaperCut. Earlier this April, another remote code execution vulnerability in the same product (CVE-2023-27350, CVSS score: 9.8) and an infor

A married couple from New York City has pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in connection with the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency stock exchange Bitfinex, resulting in the theft of about 120,000 bitcoin. The development comes more than a year after Ilya Lichtenstein, 35, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 33, were&nbsp; arrested in February 2022 , following the seizure of roughly 95,000 of the stolen crypto assets that were held by the defendants. The funds were valued at $3.6 billion at the time. Since then, the U.S. government said it has since seized another approximately $475 million tied to the breach. "Lichtenstein used a number of advanced hacking tools and techniques to gain access to Bitfinex's network," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)&nbsp; said . "Once inside their systems, Lichtenstein fraudulently authorized more than 2,000 transactions in which 119,754 bitcoin was transferred from Bitfinex to a cryptocurrency wallet in Lichtenstein's control."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new bunch of malicious packages on the npm package registry that are designed to exfiltrate sensitive developer information. Software supply chain firm Phylum, which first identified the "test" packages on July 31, 2023, said they "demonstrated increasing functionality and refinement," hours after which they were removed and re-uploaded under different, legitimate-sounding package names. While the end goal of the undertaking is not clear, it's suspected to be a highly targeted campaign&nbsp; aimed at the cryptocurrency sector &nbsp;based on references to modules such as "rocketrefer" and "binarium." All the packages were published by the npm user malikrukd4732. A common feature across all the modules is the ability to launch JavaScript ("index.js") that's equipped to exfiltrate valuable information to a remote server.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A four-year-old critical security flaw impacting Fortinet FortiOS SSL has emerged as one of the most routinely and frequently exploited vulnerabilities in 2022. "In 2022, malicious cyber actors exploited older software vulnerabilities more frequently than recently disclosed vulnerabilities and targeted unpatched, internet-facing systems," cybersecurity and intelligence agencies from the Five Eyes nations, which comprises Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S.,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a joint alert. The continued weaponization of&nbsp; CVE-2018-13379 , which was also one among the most exploited bugs in&nbsp; 2020 &nbsp;and&nbsp; 2021 , suggests a failure on the part of organizations to apply patches in a timely manner, the authorities said. "Malicious cyber actors likely prioritize developing exploits for severe and globally prevalent CVEs," according to the advisory. "While sophisticated actors also develop tools to exploit other vulnerabilities, developing exploits for cri

Threat actors are leveraging a technique called versioning to evade Google Play Store's malware detections and target Android users. "Campaigns using versioning commonly target users' credentials, data, and finances," Google Cybersecurity Action Team (GCAT)&nbsp; s aid &nbsp;in its August 2023 Threat Horizons Report shared with The Hacker News. While versioning is not a new phenomenon, it's sneaky and hard to detect. In this method, a developer releases an initial version of an app on the Play Store that passes Google's pre-publication checks, but is later updated with a malware component. This is achieved by pushing an update from an attacker-controlled server to serve malicious code on the end user device using a method called dynamic code loading (DCL), effectively turning the app into a backdoor. Earlier this May, ESET&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;a screen recording app named "iRecorder - Screen Recorder" that remained innocuous for nearly a year after it was first

The frequency and complexity of cyber threats are constantly evolving. At the same time, organizations are now collecting sensitive data that, if compromised, could result in severe financial and reputational damage.&nbsp; According to Cybersecurity Ventures , the cost of cybercrime is predicted to hit $8 trillion in 2023 and will grow to $10.5 trillion by 2025. There is also increasing public and regulatory scrutiny over data protection. Compliance regulations (such as PCI DSS and ISO 27001), as well as the need for a better understanding of your cybersecurity risks, are driving the need to conduct regular penetration tests.&nbsp; Pen testing helps to identify security flaws in your IT infrastructure before threat actors can detect and exploit them. This gives you visibility into the risks posed by potential attacks and enables you to take swift corrective action to address them. Here, we outline key factors to consider before, during, and post the penetration testing process. Pre-Penetrati

Microsoft on Wednesday disclosed that it identified a set of highly targeted social engineering attacks mounted by a Russian nation-state threat actor using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats. The tech giant attributed the attacks to a group it tracks as&nbsp; Midnight Blizzard &nbsp;(previously Nobelium). It's also called APT29, BlueBravo, Cozy Bear, Iron Hemlock, and The Dukes. "In this latest activity, the threat actor uses previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities," the company&nbsp; said . "Using these domains from compromised tenants, Midnight Blizzard leverages Teams messages to send lures that attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and eliciting approval of multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a bypass for a recently fixed actively exploited vulnerability in some versions of Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), prompting Ivanti to urge users to update to the latest version of the software. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-35082 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 10.0) and discovered by Rapid7, the issue "allows unauthenticated attackers to access the API in older unsupported versions of MobileIron Core (11.2 and below)." "If exploited, this vulnerability enables an unauthorized, remote (internet-facing) actor to potentially access users' personally identifiable information and make limited changes to the server," Ivanti&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory released on August 2, 2023. Rapid7 security researcher Stephen Fewer&nbsp; said , "CVE-2023-35082 arises from the same place as CVE-2023-35078, specifically the permissive nature of certain entries in the mifs web application's security filter chain." With the latest disclosure, Ivanti has

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Russia-nexus adversary has been linked to 94 new domains starting March 2023, suggesting that the group is actively modifying its infrastructure in response to public disclosures about its activities. Cybersecurity firm Recorded Future&nbsp;linked the revamped infrastructure to a threat actor it tracks under the name&nbsp; BlueCharlie , a hacking crew that's broadly known by the names Blue Callisto, Callisto (or Calisto), COLDRIVER, Star Blizzard (formerly SEABORGIUM), and TA446. BlueCharlie was previously given the temporary designation Threat Activity Group 53 (TAG-53). "These shifts demonstrate that these threat actors are aware of industry reporting and show a certain level of sophistication in their efforts to obfuscate or modify their activity, aiming to stymie security researchers," the company said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. BlueCharlie is assessed to be affiliated with Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), with the threat actor linked

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A sophisticated Facebook phishing campaign has been observed exploiting a zero-day flaw in Salesforce's email services, allowing threat actors to craft targeted phishing messages using the company's domain and infrastructure. "Those phishing campaigns cleverly evade conventional detection methods by chaining the Salesforce vulnerability and legacy quirks in Facebook's Web Games platform," Guardio Labs researchers Oleg Zaytsev and Nati Tal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The email messages masquerade as coming from Meta, while being sent from an email address with a "@salesforce.com" domain. They seek to trick recipients into clicking on a link by claiming that their Facebook accounts are undergoing a "comprehensive investigation" due to "suspicions of engaging in impersonation." The goal is to direct users to a rogue landing page that's designed to capture the victim's account credentials and two-factor aut

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Various European customers of different banks are being targeted by an Android banking trojan called&nbsp; SpyNote &nbsp;as part of an aggressive campaign detected in June and July 2023. "The spyware is distributed through email phishing or smishing campaigns and the fraudulent activities are executed with a combination of remote access trojan (RAT) capabilities and vishing attack," Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical analysis released Monday. SpyNote , also called SpyMax, is similar to other Android banking Trojans in that it requires&nbsp; Android's accessibility permissions &nbsp;in order to grant itself other necessary permissions and gather sensitive data from infected devices. What makes the malware strain notable is its dual functions as spyware and perform bank fraud. The attack chains commence with a bogus SMS message urging users to install a banking app by clicking on the accompanying link, redirecting the victim to the legitimate TeamViewer QuickSupport a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Data Security Posture Management is an approach to securing cloud data by ensuring that sensitive data always has the correct security posture - regardless of where it's been duplicated or moved to. So, what is DSPM? Here's a quick example: Let's say you've built an excellent&nbsp; security posture &nbsp;for your cloud data. For the sake of this example, your data is in production, it's protected behind a firewall, it's not publicly accessible, and your IAM controls have limited access properly. Now along comes a developer and replicates that data into a lower environment. What happens to that fine security posture you've built?&nbsp; Well, it's gone - and now the data is only protected by the security posture in that lower environment. So if that environment is exposed or improperly secured - so is all that sensitive data you've been trying to protect. Security postures just don't travel with their data . Data Security Posture Management ( DSPM ) was crea

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor known as&nbsp; Space Pirates &nbsp;has been linked to attacks against at least 16 organizations in Russia and Serbia over the past year by employing novel tactics and adding new cyber weapons to its arsenal. "The cybercriminals' main goals are still espionage and theft of confidential information, but the group has expanded its interests and the geography of its attacks," Positive Technologies&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep dive report published last week. Targets comprise government agencies, educational institutions, private security companies, aerospace manufacturers, agricultural producers, defense, energy, and healthcare firms in Russia and Serbia. Space Pirates was&nbsp; first exposed &nbsp;by the Russian cybersecurity company in May 2022, highlighting its attacks on the aerospace sector in the nation.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A nation-state actor with links to China is suspected of being behind a series of attacks against industrial organizations in Eastern Europe that took place last year to siphon data stored on air-gapped systems. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky attributed the intrusions with medium to high confidence to a hacking crew called&nbsp; APT31 , which is also tracked under the monikers Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, and Violet Typhoon (formerly Zirconium), citing commonalities in the tactics observed. The attacks entailed the use of more than 15 distinct implants and their variants, broken down into three broad categories based on their ability to establish persistent remote access, gather sensitive information, and transmit the collected data to actor-controlled infrastructure. "One of the implant types appeared to be a sophisticated modular malware, aimed at profiling removable drives and contaminating them with a worm to exfiltrate data from isolated, or air-gapped, networks of indus

Organizations in Italy are the target of a new phishing campaign that leverages a new strain of malware called&nbsp; WikiLoader &nbsp;with an ultimate aim to install a banking trojan, stealer, and spyware referred to as&nbsp; Ursnif &nbsp;(aka Gozi). "It is a sophisticated downloader with the objective of installing a second malware payload," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. "The malware uses multiple mechanisms to evade detection and was likely developed as a malware that can be rented out to select cybercriminal threat actors." WikiLoader is so named due to the malware making a request to Wikipedia and checking that the response has the string "The Free." The enterprise security firm said it first detected the malware in the wild on December 27, 2022, in connection with an intrusion set mounted by a threat actor it tracks as&nbsp; TA544 , which is also known as Bamboo Spider and Zeus Panda.

The P2PInfect peer-to-peer (P2) worm has been observed employing previously undocumented initial access methods to breach susceptible Redis servers and rope them into a botnet. "The malware compromises exposed instances of the Redis data store by exploiting the replication feature," Cado Security researchers Nate Bill and Matt Muir&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "A common attack pattern against Redis in cloud environments is to exploit this feature using a malicious instance to enable replication. This is achieved via connecting to an exposed Redis instance and issuing the SLAVEOF command." The Rust-based malware was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, calling out the malware's ability to exploit a critical Lua sandbox escape vulnerability ( CVE-2022-0543 , CVSS score: 10.0) to obtain a foothold into Redis instances.

Threat actors associated with the hacking crew known as Patchwork have been spotted targeting universities and research organizations in China as part of a recently observed campaign.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Demand for Virtual CISO services is soaring. According to Gartner, the use of vCISO services among small and mid-size businesses and non-regulated enterprises was expected to grow by a whopping 1900% in just one year, from only 1% in 2021 to 20% in 2022! Offering vCISO services can be especially attractive for MSPs and MSSPs. By addressing their customers' needs for proactive cyber resilience, they can generate a growing amount of recurring revenue from existing and new customers. And all while differentiating themselves from the competition. vCISO services also enable upselling of additional products and services the MSP or MSSP specializes in. However, not all MSPs and MSSPs fully understand how to provide vCISO services . Some may be unsure about which services are expected from them. Others may not realize they are already providing vCISO services and have the potential to effortlessly broaden their offerings into a complete vCISO suite or package it differently to make it more

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More details have emerged about a botnet called&nbsp; AVRecon , which has been observed making use of compromised small office/home office (SOHO) routers as part of a multi-year campaign active since at least May 2021. AVRecon was&nbsp; first disclosed &nbsp;by Lumen Black Lotus Labs earlier this month as malware capable of executing additional commands and stealing victim's bandwidth for what appears to be an illegal proxy service made available for other actors. It has also surpassed QakBot in terms of scale, having infiltrated over 41,000 nodes located across 20 countries worldwide. "The malware has been used to create residential proxy services to shroud malicious activity such as password spraying, web-traffic proxying, and ad fraud," the researchers said in the report. This has been corroborated by new findings from KrebsOnSecurity and Spur.us, which last week&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that "AVrecon is the malware engine behind a 12-year-old service called SocksEscort, which rents hacke

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are creating fake websites hosting trojanized software installers to trick unsuspecting users into downloading a downloader malware called Fruity with the goal of installing remote trojans tools like Remcos RAT. "Among the software in question are various instruments for fine-tuning CPUs, graphic cards, and BIOS; PC hardware-monitoring tools; and some other apps," cybersecurity vendor Doctor Web&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis.&nbsp; "Such installers are used as a decoy and contain not only the software potential victims are interested in, but also the trojan itself with all its components." The exact initial access vector used in the campaign is unclear but it could potentially range from phishing to drive-by downloads to malicious ads. Users who land on the fake site are prompted to download a ZIP installer package. The installer, besides activating the standard installation process, stealthily drops the Fruity trojan, a Python-based malware that unpacks an MP

A new Android malware strain called&nbsp; CherryBlos &nbsp;has been observed making use of optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to gather sensitive data stored in pictures. CherryBlos, per&nbsp; Trend Micro , is distributed via bogus posts on social media platforms and comes with capabilities to steal cryptocurrency wallet-related credentials and act as a&nbsp; clipper &nbsp;to substitute wallet addresses when a victim copies a string matching a predefined format is copied to the clipboard. Once installed, the apps seek users' permissions to grant it accessibility permissions, which allows it to automatically grant itself additional permissions as required. As a defense evasion measure, users attempting to kill or uninstall the app by entering the Settings app are redirected back to the home screen. Besides displaying fake overlays on top of legitimate crypto wallet apps to steal credentials and make fraudulent fund transfers to an attacker-controlled address, CherryBlos utilizes OCR to recog

Apple has announced plans to require developers to submit reasons to use certain APIs in their apps starting later this year with the release of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS Sonoma, tvOS 17, and watchOS 10 to prevent their abuse for data collection. "This will help ensure that apps only use these APIs for their intended purpose," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. "As part of this process, you'll need to select one or more approved reasons that accurately reflect how your app uses the API, and your app can only use the API for the reasons you've selected." The APIs that&nbsp; require &nbsp;reasons for use relate to the following - File timestamp APIs System boot time APIs Disk space APIs Active keyboard APIs, and User defaults APIs The iPhone maker said it's making the move to ensure that such APIs are not abused by app developers to collect device signals to carry out&nbsp; fingerprinting , which could be employed to&nbsp; uniquely identify users &nbsp;across different a

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday disclosed details of a "novel persistent backdoor" called&nbsp; SUBMARINE &nbsp;deployed by threat actors in connection with the hack on Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances. "SUBMARINE comprises multiple artifacts — including a SQL trigger, shell scripts, and a loaded library for a Linux daemon — that together enable execution with root privileges, persistence, command and control, and cleanup," the agency&nbsp; said . The findings come from an analysis of malware samples obtained from an unnamed organization that had been compromised by threat actors exploiting a critical flaw in ESG devices,&nbsp; CVE-2023-2868 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), which allows for remote command injection. Evidence gathered so far shows that the attackers behind the activity, a suspected China nexus-actor tracked by Mandiant as&nbsp; UNC4841 , leveraged the flaw as a zero-day in October 2022 to gain initial access to victim envir

IcedID Malware Adapts and Expands Threat with Updated BackConnect Module<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/icedid-malware-adapts-and-expands.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors linked to the malware loader known as IcedID have made updates to the BackConnect (BC) module that's used for post-compromise activity on hacked systems, new findings from Team Cymru reveal. IcedID, also called BokBot , is a strain of malware similar to&nbsp; Emotet &nbsp;and&nbsp; QakBot &nbsp;that started off as a banking trojan in 2017, before switching to the role of an initial access facilitator for other payloads. Recent versions of the malware have been&nbsp; observed &nbsp;removing functionality related to online banking fraud to prioritize ransomware delivery. The BackConnect (BC) module,&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Netresec in October 2022, relies on a proprietary command-and-control (C2) protocol to exchange commands between a server and the infected host. The protocol, which comes with a VNC component for remote access, has also been identified in other malware such as the now-discontinued&nbsp; BazarLoader &nbsp;and QakBot. In December 2022, Team Cymru&nbsp; reported &nbsp;the discovery of 11 BC C2s a

An ongoing cyber attack campaign has set its sights on Korean-speaking individuals by employing U.S. Military-themed document lures to trick them into running malware on compromised systems. Cybersecurity firm Securonix is tracking the activity under the name&nbsp; STARK#MULE . "Based on the source and likely targets, these types of attacks are on par with past attacks stemming from typical North Korean groups such as APT37 as South Korea has historically been a primary target of the group, especially its government officials," security researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov said in a report shared with The Hacker News. APT37, also known by the names Nickel Foxcroft, Reaper, Ricochet Chollima, and ScarCruft, is a&nbsp; North Korean nation-state actor &nbsp;that's known to exclusively focus on targets in its southern counterpart, specifically those involved in reporting on North Korea and supporting defectors.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As part of&nbsp; Checkmarx's mission &nbsp;to help organizations develop and deploy secure software, the Security Research team started looking at the security posture of major car manufacturers. Porsche has a well-established Vulnerability Reporting Policy (Disclosure Policy) [1] , it was considered in scope for our research, so we decided to start there, and see what we could find. What we found is an attack scenario that results from chaining security issues found on different Porsche's assets, a website and a GraphQL API, that could lead to data exfiltration. Data exfiltration is an attack technique that can impact businesses and organizations, regardless of size. When malicious users breach a company's or organization's systems and exfiltrate data, it can be a jarring and business-critical moment. Porsche has a diverse online presence - deploying several microsites, websites, and web applications. The Porsche Experience [2] is one website that allows registered users to

A legitimate Windows search feature is being exploited by malicious actors to download arbitrary payloads from remote servers and compromise targeted systems with remote access trojans such as AsyncRAT and Remcos RAT.

"Attackers are directing users to websites that exploit the 'search-ms' functionality using JavaScript hosted on the page," security researchers Mathanraj Thangaraju and Sijo Jacob&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday write-up.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Russian nation-state actor known as&nbsp; BlueBravo &nbsp;has been observed targeting diplomatic entities throughout Eastern Europe with the goal of delivering a new backdoor called GraphicalProton, exemplifying the continuous evolution of the threat. The phishing campaign is characterized by the use of legitimate internet services (LIS) for command-and-control (C2) obfuscation, Recorded Future said in a new report published Thursday. The activity was observed between March and May 2023. BlueBravo , also known by the names APT29, Cloaked Ursa, and Midnight Blizzard (formerly Nobelium), is attributed to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and has in the past&nbsp; used &nbsp;Dropbox, Firebase, Google Drive, Notion, and Trello to evade detection and stealthily establish communications with infected hosts. To that end, GraphicalProton is the latest addition to a long list of malware targeting diplomatic organizations after&nbsp; GraphicalNeutrino &nbsp;(aka SNOWYAMBER),&nbsp; HALFRIG, and QUARTERRIG .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Users of Metabase, a popular business intelligence and data visualization software package, are being advised to update to the latest version following the discovery of an "extremely severe" flaw that could result in pre-authenticated remote code execution on affected installations. Tracked as CVE-2023-38646 , the issue impacts open-source editions prior to 0.46.6.1 and Metabase Enterprise versions before 1.46.6.1. "An unauthenticated attacker can run arbitrary commands with the same privileges as the Metabase server on the server you are running Metabase on," Metabase said in an advisory released last week. The issue has also been addressed in the following older versions - 0.45.4.1 and 1.45.4.1 0.44.7.1 and 1.44.7.1, and 0.43.7.2 and 1.43.7.2 While there is no evidence that the issue has been exploited in the wild, data gathered by the Shadowserver Foundation shows that 5,488 out of the total 6,936 Metabase instances are vulnerable as of July 26, 202

Cybersecurity agencies in Australia and the U.S. have&nbsp; published &nbsp;a joint cybersecurity advisory warning against security flaws in web applications that could be exploited by malicious actors to orchestrate data breach incidents and steal confidential data. This includes a specific class of bugs called Insecure Direct Object Reference ( IDOR ), a type of access control flaw that occurs when an application utilizes user-supplied input or an identifier for direct access to an internal resource, such as a database record, without any additional validations. A&nbsp; typical example &nbsp;of an IDOR flaw is the ability of a user to trivially change the URL (e.g., https://example[.]site/details.php?id= 12345 ) to obtain unauthorized data of another transaction (i.e., https://example[.]site/details.php?id= 67890 ).

A new malvertising campaign has been observed leveraging ads on Google Search and Bing to target users seeking IT tools like AnyDesk, Cisco AnyConnect VPN, and WinSCP, and trick them into downloading trojanized installers with an aim to breach enterprise networks and likely carry out future ransomware attacks.

Nitrogen was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by eSentire in June 2023, detailing an infection chain that redirects users to compromised WordPress sites hosting malicious ISO image files that ultimately culminate in the delivery of Python scripts and Cobalt Strike Beacons onto the targeted system.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As cloud applications are built, tested and updated, they wind their way through an ever-complex series of different tools and teams. Across hundreds or even thousands of technologies that make up the patchwork quilt of development and cloud environments, security processes are all too often applied in only the final phases of software development.&nbsp; Placing security at the very end of the production pipeline puts both devs and security on the back foot. Developers want to build and ship secure apps; security teams want to support this process by strengthening application security. However, today's security processes are legacy approaches that once worked brilliantly for the tight constraints of on-prem production, but struggle in quasi-public, ever-shifting cloud environments. As a result, security is an afterthought, and any attempt to squeeze siloed security into agile SDLC can&nbsp; swell the cost of patching by 600% . A new cloud security operating model is long overdue. Shift-le

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Misconfigured and poorly secured Apache Tomcat servers are being targeted as part of a new campaign designed to deliver the&nbsp; Mirai botnet malware &nbsp;and cryptocurrency miners. The findings come courtesy of Aqua, which detected more than 800 attacks against its Tomcat server honeypots over a two-year time period, with 96% of the attacks linked to the Mirai botnet. Of these attack attempts, 20% (or 152) entailed the use of a web shell script dubbed "neww" that originated from 24 unique IP addresses, with 68% of them originating from a single IP address (104.248.157[.]218). "The threat actor scanned for Tomcat servers and launched a brute force attack against it, attempting to gain access to the Tomcat web application manager by trying different combinations of credentials associated with it," Aqua security researcher Nitzan Yaakov&nbsp; said . Upon gaining a successful foothold, the threat actors have been observed deploying a&nbsp; WAR file &nbsp;that contains a malicious web s

A city court in Moscow on Wednesday convicted Group-IB co-founder and CEO Ilya Sachkov of "high treason" and jailed him for 14 years in a "strict regime colony" over accusations of passing information to foreign spies. "The court found Sachkov guilty under Article 275 of the Russian Criminal Code (high treason) sentencing him to 14 years of incarceration in a maximum-security jail, restriction of freedom for one year and a fine of 500,000 rubles (about $5,550)," state news agency TASS&nbsp; reported . Sachkov, who has been in custody&nbsp; since September 2021 &nbsp;and denied wrongdoing, had been accused of handing over classified information to foreign intelligence in 2011, which the prosecutors said caused reputational damage to Russia's national interests. The exact nature of the charges is unclear.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday approved new rules that require publicly traded companies to publicize details of a cyber attack within four days of identifying that it has a "material" impact on their finances, marking a major shift in how computer breaches are disclosed. "Whether a company loses a factory in a fire — or millions of files in a cybersecurity incident — it may be material to investors," SEC chair Gary Gensler&nbsp; said . "Currently, many public companies provide cybersecurity disclosure to investors. I think companies and investors alike, however, would benefit if this disclosure were made in a more consistent, comparable, and decision-useful way." To that end, the new obligations mandate that companies reveal the incident's nature, scope, and timing, as well as its impact. This disclosure, however, may be delayed by an additional period of up to 60 days should it be determined that giving out such specific

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A deeper analysis of a recently discovered malware called&nbsp; Decoy Dog &nbsp;has revealed that it's a significant upgrade over the&nbsp; Pupy RAT , an open-source remote access trojan it's modeled on. "Decoy Dog has a full suite of powerful, previously unknown capabilities – including the ability to move victims to another controller, allowing them to maintain communication with compromised machines and remain hidden for long periods of time," Infoblox&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. "Some victims have actively communicated with a Decoy Dog server for over a year." Other new features allow the malware to execute arbitrary Java code on the client and connect to emergency controllers using a mechanism that's similar to a traditional DNS domain generation algorithm ( DGA ), with the Decoy Dog domains engineered to respond to replayed DNS queries from breached clients. The sophisticated toolkit was&nbsp; first discovered &nbsp;by the cybersecurity firm in early April 2023 after

A new study conducted by Uptycs has uncovered a stark increase in the distribution of information stealing (a.k.a. infostealer or stealer) malware. Incidents have more than doubled in Q1 2023, indicating an alarming trend that threatens global organizations. According to the new Uptycs' whitepaper,&nbsp; Stealers are Organization Killers , a variety of new info stealers have emerged this year, preying on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. Telegram has notably been used extensively by these malware authors for command, control, and data exfiltration. What is a Stealer? A stealer is a type of malware that targets its victim by stealing sensitive information that can include passwords, login credentials, and other personal data. After collecting such data, the stealer sends it to the threat actor's command and control (C2) system. RedLine and Vidar, two well-known stealers, took advantage of log-providing services to infiltrate private systems. RedLine primarily targets credenti

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A severe privilege escalation issue impacting MikroTik RouterOS could be weaponized by remote malicious actors to execute arbitrary code and seize full control of vulnerable devices. Cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-30799 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.1), the shortcoming is expected to put approximately 500,000 and 900,000 RouterOS systems at risk of exploitation via their web and/or Winbox interfaces, respectively, VulnCheck disclosed in a Tuesday report. "CVE-2023-30799 does require authentication," security researcher Jacob Baines&nbsp; said . "In fact, the vulnerability itself is a simple privilege escalation from admin to 'super-admin' which results in access to an arbitrary function. Acquiring credentials to RouterOS systems is easier than one might expect." This is because the Mikrotik RouterOS operating system does not offer any protection against password brute-force attacks and ships with a well-known default "admin" user, with its password being an empty string

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
North Korean nation-state actors affiliated with the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) have been attributed to the&nbsp; JumpCloud hack &nbsp;following an operational security (OPSEC) blunder that exposed their actual IP address. Google-owned threat intelligence firm Mandiant attributed the activity to a threat actor it tracks under the name UNC4899, which likely shares overlaps with clusters already being monitored as Jade Sleet and TraderTraitor, a group with a history of striking blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. UNC4899 also overlaps with&nbsp; APT43 , another hacking crew associated with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) that was unmasked earlier this March as conducting a series of campaigns to gather intelligence and siphon cryptocurrency from targeted companies. The adversarial collective's modus operandi is characterized by the use of Operational Relay Boxes ( ORBs ) using L2TP IPsec tunnels along with commercial VPN providers to disguise the attacker's

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The financially motivated threat actors behind the&nbsp; Casbaneiro &nbsp;banking malware family have been observed making use of a User Account Control ( UAC ) bypass technique to gain full administrative privileges on a machine, a sign that the threat actor is evolving their tactics to avoid detection and execute malicious code on compromised assets. "They are still heavily focused on Latin American financial institutions, but the changes in their techniques represent a significant risk to multi-regional financial organizations as well," Sygnia&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement shared with The Hacker News. Casbaneiro , also known as Metamorfo and Ponteiro, is best known for its banking trojan, which first emerged in mass email spam campaigns targeting the Latin American financial sector in 2018. Infection chains typically begin with a phishing email pointing to a booby-trapped attachment that, when launched, activates a series of steps that culminate in the deployment of the banking malware

As the number of people using macOS keeps going up, so does the desire of hackers to take advantage of flaws in Apple's operating system.&nbsp; What Are the Rising Threats to macOS? There is a common misconception among macOS fans that Apple devices are immune to hacking and malware infection. However, users have been facing more and more dangers recently. Inventive attackers are specifically targeting Mac systems, as seen with the "Geacon" Cobalt Strike tool attack. This tool enables them to perform malicious actions such as data theft, privilege elevation, and remote device control, placing the security and privacy of Mac users at grave risk. Earlier this year, researchers also uncovered the MacStealer malware, which also stole sensitive data from Apple users. Documents, iCloud keychain data, browser cookies, credit card credentials – nothing is safe from the prying eyes.&nbsp; But that's not all.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A set of five security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the Terrestrial Trunked Radio ( TETRA ) standard for radio communication used widely by government entities and critical infrastructure sectors, including what's believed to be an intentional backdoor that could have potentially exposed sensitive information. The issues, discovered by Midnight Blue in 2021 and held back until now, have been collectively called&nbsp; TETRA:BURST . There is no conclusive evidence to determine that the vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild to date. "Depending on infrastructure and device configurations, these vulnerabilities allow for real time decryption, harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks, message injection, user deanonymization, or session key pinning," the Netherlands-based cybersecurity company&nbsp; said . Standardized by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in 1995, TETRA is used in more than 100 countries and as a police radio communication system

How do you overcome today's talent gap in cybersecurity? This is a crucial issue — particularly when you find executive leadership or the board asking pointed questions about your security team's ability to defend the organization against new and current threats. This is why many security leaders find themselves turning to managed security services like MDR ( managed detection and response ), which can offer an immediate solution. The right MDR partner can act as an extension of your existing team, while offering a fast and budget-friendly option for uplevelling security at organizations of virtually any size. Here's a look at common staffing challenges that MDR helps solve: Overcoming Cybersecurity Talent Challenges From stopping ransomware to securing the attack surface of the environment, most security teams have more to do than they can manage.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new security vulnerability has been discovered in AMD's Zen 2 architecture-based processors that could be exploited to extract sensitive data such as encryption keys and passwords. Discovered by Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy, the flaw – codenamed&nbsp; Zenbleed &nbsp;and tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-20593 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.5) – allows data exfiltration at the rate of 30 kb per core, per second. The issue is part of a broader category of weaknesses called&nbsp; speculative execution attacks , in which the optimization technique widely used in modern CPUs is abused to access cryptographic keys from CPU registers. "Under specific microarchitectural circumstances, a register in 'Zen 2' CPUs may not be written to 0 correctly," AMD&nbsp; explained &nbsp;in an advisory. "This may cause data from another process and/or thread to be stored in the YMM register , which may allow an attacker to potentially access sensitive information."

Apple has&nbsp; rolled out security updates &nbsp;to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and Safari to address several security vulnerabilities, including one actively exploited zero-day bug in the wild. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38606 , the shortcoming resides in the kernel and permits a malicious app to modify sensitive kernel state potentially. The company said it was addressed with improved state management. "Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited against versions of iOS released before iOS 15.7.1," the tech giant noted in its advisory. It's worth noting that CVE-2023-38606 is the third security vulnerability discovered in connection with&nbsp; Operation Triangulation , a sophisticated mobile cyber espionage campaign targeting iOS devices since 2019 using a zero-click exploit chain.

The flaws, discovered by Mandiant on February 28, 2023, have been assigned the identifiers&nbsp; CVE-2023-26077 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-26078 , with the issues remediated in versions 1.8.3.7 and 1.8.4.9 released by Atera on April 17, 2023, and June 26, 2023, respectively. "The ability to initiate an operation from a NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context can present potential security risks if not properly managed," security researcher Andrew Oliveau&nbsp; said . "For instance, misconfigured&nbsp; Custom Actions &nbsp;running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM can be exploited by attackers to execute local privilege escalation attacks." Successful exploitation of such weaknesses could pave the way for the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Both the flaws reside in the MSI installer's repair functionality, potentially crea

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has announced that it intends to add support for Message Layer Security ( MLS ) to its Messages service for Android and open source implementation of the specification. "Most modern consumer messaging platforms (including Google Messages) support end-to-end encryption, but users today are limited to communicating with contacts who use the same platform," Giles Hogben, privacy engineering director at Google,&nbsp; said . "This is why Google is strongly supportive of regulatory efforts that require interoperability for large end-to-end messaging platforms." The development comes as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)&nbsp; released &nbsp;the core specification of the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol as a Request for Comments ( RFC 9420 ). Some of the other major companies that have thrown their weight behind the protocol are Amazon Web Services (AWS) Wickr, Cisco, Cloudflare, The Matrix.org Foundation, Mozilla, Phoenix R&amp;D, and Wire.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The healthcare industry is under a constant barrage of cyberattacks. It has traditionally been one of the most frequently targeted industries, and things haven't changed in 2023. The U.S. Government's Office for Civil Rights reported&nbsp; 145 data breaches &nbsp;in the United States during the first quarter of this year. That follows 707 incidents a year ago, during which over 50 million records were stolen. Health records often include names, birth dates, social security numbers, and addresses. This treasure trove of data is used in identity theft, tax fraud, and other crimes. It is the high value of the data that makes healthcare applications such a promising target. The healthcare industry was hesitant to adopt SaaS applications. However, SaaS applications lead to better collaboration among medical professionals, leading to improved patient outcomes. That, combined with SaaS's ability to reduce costs and improve financial performance, has led to the industry fully embracing SaaS solutions

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a now-patched flaw in OpenSSH that could be potentially exploited to run arbitrary commands remotely on compromised hosts under specific conditions. "This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable OpenSSH's forwarded ssh-agent," Saeed Abbasi, manager of vulnerability research at Qualys,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis last week. The vulnerability is being tracked under the CVE identifier&nbsp; CVE-2023-38408 &nbsp;(CVSS score: N/A). It impacts all versions of OpenSSH before&nbsp; 9.3p2 . OpenSSH is a popular connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol that's used for encrypting all traffic to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. Successful exploitation requires the presence of certain libraries on the victim system and that the SSH authentication agent is&nbsp; forwarded &nbsp;to an attacker-controlled system. SSH agent is a&nbsp; background program &nbsp;that maintains users' keys

Cybersecurity researchers said they have discovered what they say is the first open-source software supply chain attacks specifically targeting the banking sector. "These attacks showcased advanced techniques, including targeting specific components in web assets of the victim bank by attaching malicious functionalities to it," Checkmarx&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "The attackers employed deceptive tactics such as creating a fake LinkedIn profile to appear credible and customized command-and-control (C2) centers for each target, exploiting legitimate services for illicit activities." The npm packages have since been reported and taken down. The names of the packages were not disclosed. In the first attack, the malware author is said to have uploaded a couple of packages to the npm registry in early April 2023 by posing as an employee of the target bank. The modules came with a preinstall script to activate the infection sequence. To complete the rus

The recent attack against&nbsp; Microsoft's email infrastructure &nbsp;by a Chinese nation-state actor referred to as Storm-0558 is said to have a broader scope than previously thought. According to cloud security company Wiz, the inactive Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key used to forge Azure Active Directory (Azure AD or AAD) tokens to gain illicit access to Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Outlook.com could also have allowed the adversary to forge access tokens for various types of Azure AD applications. This&nbsp; includes &nbsp;every application that supports personal account authentication, such as OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams; customers applications that support the "Login with Microsoft functionality," and multi-tenant applications in certain conditions.

HotRat: New Variant of AsyncRAT Malware Spreading Through Pirated Software<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/hotrat-new-variant-of-asyncrat-malware.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new variant of&nbsp; AsyncRAT &nbsp;malware dubbed&nbsp; HotRat &nbsp;is being distributed via free, pirated versions of popular software and utilities such as video games, image and sound editing software, and Microsoft Office. "HotRat malware equips attackers with a wide array of capabilities, such as stealing login credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, screen capturing, keylogging, installing more malware, and gaining access to or altering clipboard data," Avast security researcher Martin a Milánek&nbsp; said . The Czech cybersecurity firm said the trojan has been prevalent in the wild since at least in October 2022, with a majority of the infections concentrated in Thailand, Guyana, Libya, Suriname, Mali, Pakistan, Cambodia, South Africa, and India. The attacks entail bundling the cracked software available online via torrent sites with a malicious AutoHotkey ( AHK ) script that initiates an infection chain designed to deactivate antivirus solutions on the compromised host and ultimately la

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware strain known as BundleBot has been stealthily operating under the radar by taking advantage of&nbsp; .NET single-file deployment techniques , enabling threat actors to capture sensitive information from compromised hosts. "BundleBot is abusing the dotnet bundle (single-file), self-contained format that results in very low or no static detection at all," Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week, adding it is "commonly distributed via Facebook Ads and compromised accounts leading to websites masquerading as regular program utilities, AI tools, and games." Some of these websites aim to mimic Google Bard, the company's conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot, enticing victims into downloading a bogus RAR archive ("Google_AI.rar") hosted on legitimate cloud storage services such as Dropbox.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Regardless of the country, local government is essential in most citizens' lives. It provides many day-to-day services and handles various issues. Therefore, their effects can be far-reaching and deeply felt when security failures occur. In early 2023, Oakland, California, &nbsp;fell victim to a ransomware attack . Although city officials have not disclosed how the attack occurred, experts suspect a phishing email is the most likely cause. As a result, city officials brought down their servers to contain the attack. Governments have been the target to many ransomware attacks &nbsp;and breaches. As most local governments maintain a small IT staff, there is potential for shared passwords, reused credentials, and a lack of multi-factor authentication security, exposing vulnerabilities for a breach.&nbsp; Oakland is Breached It was first noticed on a Wednesday evening in early February; when Oakland, California city officials quickly took most services' backend servers offline and posted a m

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Several distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnets have been observed exploiting a critical flaw in Zyxel devices that came to light in April 2023 to gain remote control of vulnerable systems. "Through the capture of exploit traffic, the attacker's IP address was identified, and it was determined that the attacks were occurring in multiple regions, including Central America, North America, East Asia, and South Asia," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . The flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-28771 (CVSS score: 9.8), is a command injection bug affecting multiple firewall models that could potentially allow an unauthorized actor to execute arbitrary code by sending a specifically crafted packet to the targeted appliance. Last month, the Shadowserver Foundation&nbsp; warned &nbsp;that the flaw was being "actively exploited to build a Mirai-like botnet" at least since May 26, 2023, an indication of how abuse of&nbsp; servers running unpatched software &nbsp;is on the rise.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an advisory on Thursday warning that the newly disclosed critical security flaw in Citrix NetScaler Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Gateway devices is being abused to drop web shells on vulnerable systems. "In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day to drop a web shell on a critical infrastructure organization's non-production environment NetScaler ADC appliance," the agency&nbsp; said . "The web shell enabled the actors to perform discovery on the victim's active directory (AD) and collect and exfiltrate AD data. The actors attempted to move laterally to a domain controller but network segmentation controls for the appliance blocked movement." The shortcoming in question is&nbsp; CVE-2023-3519 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), a code injection bug that could result in unauthenticated remote code execution.

Two more security flaws have been disclosed in AMI MegaRAC Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) software that, if successfully exploited, could allow threat actors to remotely commandeer vulnerable servers and deploy malware. "These new vulnerabilities range in severity from High to Critical, including unauthenticated remote code execution and unauthorized device access with superuser permissions," Eclypsium researchers Vlad Babkin and Scott Scheferman said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "They can be exploited by remote attackers having access to Redfish remote management interfaces, or from a compromised host operating system." To make matters worse, the shortcomings could also be weaponized to drop persistent firmware implants that are immune to operating system reinstalls and hard drive replacements, brick motherboard components, cause physical damage through overvolting attacks, and induce indefinite reboot loops.

Mallox ransomware activities in 2023 have witnessed a 174% increase when compared to the previous year, new findings from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 reveal. "Mallox ransomware, like many other ransomware threat actors, follows the double extortion trend: stealing data before encrypting an organization's files, and then threatening to publish the stolen data on a leak site as leverage to convince victims to pay the ransom fee," security researchers Lior Rochberger and Shimi Cohen&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report shared with The Hacker News. Mallox is linked to a threat actor that's also linked to&nbsp; other ransomware strains , such as TargetCompany, Tohnichi, Fargo, and, most recently, Xollam. It first burst onto the scene in June 2021. Some of the prominent sectors targeted by Mallox are manufacturing, professional and legal services, and wholesale and retail. A notable aspect of the group is its pattern of exploiting poorly secured MS-SQL servers via&nbsp; dictionary attacks &nbsp;as

If it seems like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) has been around forever, it's because it has (at least compared to the many technologies that rise and fall within just a few years.) The initial version, known as "Remote Desktop Protocol 4.0," was released in 1996 as part of the Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server edition and allowed users to remotely access and control Windows-based computers over a network connection.&nbsp; In the intervening decades, RDP has become a widely used protocol for remote access and administration of Windows-based systems. RDP plays a crucial role in enabling remote work, IT support, and system management and has served as the foundation for various remote desktop and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solutions.&nbsp; The downside of RDP's widespread use is that a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in an RDP gateway can have severe consequences, potentially leading to significant damage and compromising the security and integrity of the affec

Turla's New DeliveryCheck Backdoor Breaches Ukrainian Defense Sector<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/turlas-new-deliverycheck-backdoor.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The defense sector in Ukraine and Eastern Europe has been targeted by a novel .NET-based backdoor called&nbsp; DeliveryCheck &nbsp;(aka CAPIBAR or GAMEDAY) that's capable of delivering next-stage payloads. The Microsoft threat intelligence team, in&nbsp; collaboration &nbsp;with the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA), attributed the attacks to a Russian nation-state actor known as&nbsp; Turla , which is also tracked under the names Iron Hunter, Secret Blizzard (formerly Krypton), Uroburos, Venomous Bear, and Waterbug. It's linked to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB). "DeliveryCheck is distributed via email as documents with malicious macros," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets. "It persists via a scheduled task that downloads and launches it in memory. It also contacts a C2 server to retrieve tasks, which can include the launch of arbitrary payloads embedded in XSLT stylesheets." Successful initial access is also accompanied in some cases by t

New P2PInfect Worm Targeting Redis Servers on Linux and Windows Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/new-p2pinfect-worm-targeting-redis.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new cloud targeting, peer-to-peer (P2P) worm called&nbsp; P2PInfect &nbsp;that targets vulnerable Redis instances for follow-on exploitation. "P2PInfect exploits Redis servers running on both Linux and Windows Operating Systems making it more scalable and potent than other worms," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers William Gamazo and Nathaniel Quist&nbsp; said . "This worm is also written in Rust, a highly scalable and cloud-friendly programming language." It's estimated that as many as 934 unique Redis systems may be vulnerable to the threat. The first known instance of P2PInfect was detected on July 11, 2023. A notable characteristic of the worm is its ability to infects vulnerable Redis instances by exploiting a critical Lua sandbox escape vulnerability,&nbsp; CVE-2022-0543 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 10.0), which has been previously exploited to deliver multiple&nbsp; malware families &nbsp;such as&nbsp; Muhstik ,&nbsp; Redigo , and&nbsp; HeadCrab &nbsp;over the past ye

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Attack surfaces are growing faster than security teams can keep up. To stay ahead, you need to know what's exposed and where attackers are most likely to strike. With cloud migration dramatically increasing the number of internal and external targets, prioritizing threats and managing your attack surface from an attacker's perspective has never been more important. Let's look at why it's growing, and how to monitor and manage it properly with tools like&nbsp; Intruder . What is your attack surface? First, it's important to understand that your attack surface is the sum of your digital assets that are 'exposed' – whether the digital assets are secure or vulnerable, known or unknown, in active use or not. This attack surface changes continuously over time, and includes digital assets that are on-premises, in the cloud, in subsidiary networks, and in third-party environments. In short, it's anything that a hacker can attack.&nbsp; What is attack surface managemen

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have&nbsp; released &nbsp;a set of recommendations to address security concerns with 5G standalone network slicing and harden them against possible threats. "The threat landscape in 5G is dynamic; due to this, advanced monitoring, auditing, and other analytical capabilities are required to meet certain levels of network slicing service level requirements over time," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Security Agency (NSA)&nbsp; said . 5G is the fifth-generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, offering increased data speeds and lower latency. Network slicing is an architectural model that allows mobile service providers to partition their network up into several independent "slices" in order to create virtual networks that cater to different clients and use cases. The latest advisory builds upon guidance&nbsp; previously issued &nbsp;by the agencies in December 2022, warning

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unidentified threat actor compromised an application used by multiple entities in Pakistan to deliver&nbsp; ShadowPad , a successor to the PlugX backdoor that's commonly associated with&nbsp; Chinese hacking crews . Targets included a Pakistan government entity, a public sector bank, and a telecommunications provider, according to Trend Micro. The infections took place between mid-February 2022 and September 2022. The cybersecurity company said the incident could be the result of a supply-chain attack, in which a legitimate piece of software used by targets of interest is trojanized to deploy malware capable of gathering sensitive information from compromised systems. The attack chain takes the form of a malicious installer for&nbsp; E-Office , an application developed by the National Information Technology Board (NITB) of Pakistan to help government departments go paperless. It's currently not clear how the backdoored E-Office installer was delivered to the targets. That said, there&amp;

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The financially motivated threat actor known as FIN8 has been observed using a "revamped" version of a backdoor called&nbsp; Sardonic &nbsp;to deliver the&nbsp; BlackCat ransomware . According to the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, the development is an attempt on the part of the e-crime group to diversify its focus and maximize profits from infected entities. The intrusion attempt took place in December 2022. FIN8 is being tracked by the cybersecurity company under the name Syssphinx. Known to be active since at least 2016, the adversary was originally attributed to attacks targeting point-of-sale (PoS) systems using malware such as PUNCHTRACK and BADHATCH. The group resurfaced after more than a year in March 2021 with an updated version of BADHATCH, following it up with a completely new bespoke implant called Sardonic , which was disclosed by Bitdefender in August 2021.

Conor Brian Fitzpatrick , the owner of the now-defunct BreachForums website, has pleaded guilty to charges related to his operation of the cybercrime forum as well as having child pornography images. The development,&nbsp; first reported &nbsp;by DataBreaches.net last week, comes nearly four months after Fitzpatrick (aka pompompurin) was&nbsp; formally charged &nbsp;in the U.S. with conspiracy to commit access device fraud and possession of child pornography. BreachForums, launched in March 2022, operated as an illegal marketplace that allowed its members to trade hacked or stolen databases, enabling other criminal actors to gain unauthorized access to target systems. It was shut down in March 2023 shortly after&nbsp; Fitzpatrick's arrest &nbsp;in New York. As many as 888 databases consisting of 14 billion individual records are estimated to have been found in total. The forum had over 333,000 members prior to its takedown.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are actively exploiting a recently disclosed critical security flaw in the WooCommerce Payments WordPress plugin as part of a massive targeted campaign. The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-28121 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), is a case of authentication bypass that enables unauthenticated attackers to impersonate arbitrary users and perform some actions as the impersonated user, including an administrator, potentially leading to site takeover. "Large-scale attacks against the vulnerability, assigned CVE-2023-28121, began on Thursday, July 14, 2023 and continued over the weekend, peaking at 1.3 million attacks against 157,000 sites on Saturday, July 16, 2023," Wordfence security researcher Ram Gall&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday post. Versions 4.8.0 through 5.6.1 of WooCommerce Payments are vulnerable. The plugin is installed on over 600,000 sites.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A little over a week after&nbsp; JumpCloud reset API keys of customers &nbsp;impacted by a security incident, the company said the intrusion was the work of a sophisticated nation-state actor. The adversary "gained unauthorized access to our systems to target a small and specific set of our customers," Bob Phan, chief information security officer (CISO) at JumpCloud,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post-mortem report. "The attack vector used by the threat actor has been mitigated." The U.S. enterprise software firm said it identified anomalous activity on June 27, 2023, on an internal orchestration system, which it traced back to a spear-phishing campaign mounted by the attacker on June 22. While JumpCloud said it took security steps to shield its network by rotating credentials and rebuilding its systems, it wasn't until July 5 when it detected "unusual activity" in the commands framework for a small set of customers, prompting a forced-rotation of all admin API keys.

Threat actors are taking advantage of Android's&nbsp; WebAPK technology &nbsp;to trick unsuspecting users into installing malicious web apps on Android phones that are designed to capture sensitive personal information. "The attack began with victims receiving SMS messages suggesting the need to update a mobile banking application," researchers from CSIRT KNF&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis released last week. "The link contained in the message led to a site that used WebAPK technology to install a malicious application on the victim's device." The application impersonates PKO Bank Polski, a multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in Warsaw. Details of the campaign were&nbsp; first shared &nbsp;by Polish cybersecurity firm RIFFSEC. WebAPK allows users to install progressive web apps (PWAs) to their home screen on Android devices without having to use the Google Play Store.

Cyber attacks using infected USB infection drives as an initial access vector have witnessed a three-fold increase in the first half of 2023,&nbsp; That's according to new findings from Mandiant, which detailed two such campaigns – SOGU and SNOWYDRIVE – targeting both public and private sector entities across the world. SOGU is the "most prevalent USB-based cyber espionage attack using USB flash drives and one of the most aggressive cyber espionage campaigns targeting both public and private sector organizations globally across industry verticals," the Google-owned threat intelligence firm&nbsp; said . The activity has been attributed to a China-based cluster called TEMP.Hex, which is also tracked under the names Camaro Dragon, Earth Preta, and Mustang Panda. Targets include construction and engineering, business services, government, health, transportation, and retail in Europe, Asia, and the U.S. The infection chain detailed by Mandiant exhibits tactical commonalities with

Cybercriminals Exploit Microsoft Word Vulnerabilities to Deploy LokiBot Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/cybercriminals-exploit-microsoft-word.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft Word documents exploiting known remote code execution flaws are being used as phishing lures to drop malware called&nbsp; LokiBot &nbsp;on compromised systems. "LokiBot, also known as Loki PWS, has been a well-known information-stealing Trojan active since 2015," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . "It primarily targets Windows systems and aims to gather sensitive information from infected machines." The cybersecurity company, which spotted the campaign in May 2023, said the attacks take advantage of&nbsp; CVE-2021-40444 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2022-30190 &nbsp;(aka Follina) to achieve code execution. The Word file that weaponizes CVE-2021-40444 contains an external GoFile link embedded within an XML file that leads to the download of an HTML file, which exploits Follina to download a next-stage payload, an injector module written in Visual Basic that decrypts and launches LokiBot. The injector also features evasion techniques to check for the presence of debuggers a

The Russia-linked threat actor known as Gamaredon has been observed conducting data exfiltration activities within an hour of the initial compromise.

Gamaredon , also called Aqua Blizzard, Armageddon, Shuckworm, or UAC-0010, is a&nbsp; state-sponsored actor &nbsp;with ties to the SBU Main Office in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. The group is estimated to have infected thousands of government computers. It is also one of the&nbsp; many Russian hacking crews &nbsp;that have maintained an&nbsp; active presence &nbsp;since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war in February 2022, leveraging phishing campaigns to deliver PowerShell backdoors such as GammaSteel to conduct recon

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
With generative artificial intelligence (AI) becoming all the rage these days, it's perhaps not surprising that the technology has been repurposed by malicious actors to their own advantage, enabling avenues for accelerated cybercrime. According to findings from SlashNext, a new generative AI cybercrime tool called&nbsp; WormGPT &nbsp;has been advertised on underground forums as a way for adversaries to launch sophisticated phishing and business email compromise ( BEC ) attacks. "This tool presents itself as a blackhat alternative to GPT models, designed specifically for malicious activities," security researcher Daniel Kelley&nbsp; said . "Cybercriminals can use such technology to automate the creation of highly convincing fake emails, personalized to the recipient, thus increasing the chances of success for the attack." The author of the software has described it as the "biggest enemy of the well-known ChatGPT" that "lets you do all sorts of illegal stuff.

Microsoft on Friday said a validation error in its source code allowed for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tokens to be forged by a malicious actor known as&nbsp; Storm-0558 &nbsp;using a Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key to breach two dozen organizations. "Storm-0558 acquired an inactive MSA consumer signing key and used it to forge authentication tokens for Azure AD enterprise and MSA consumer to access OWA and Outlook.com," the tech giant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deeper analysis of the campaign. "The method by which the actor acquired the key is a matter of ongoing investigation." "Though the key was intended only for MSA accounts, a validation issue allowed this key to be trusted for signing Azure AD tokens. This issue has been corrected." It's not immediately clear if the token validation issue was exploited as a "zero-day vulnerability" or if Microsoft was already aware of the problem before it came under in-the-wild abuse.

Critical Security Flaws Uncovered in Honeywell Experion DCS and QuickBlox Services<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/critical-security-flaws-uncovered-in.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in various services, including Honeywell Experion distributed control system (DCS) and QuickBlox, that, if successfully exploited, could result in severe compromise of affected systems. Dubbed Crit.IX, the nine flaws in the Honeywell Experion DCS platform allow for "unauthorized remote code execution, which means an attacker would have the power to take over the devices and alter the operation of the DCS controller, whilst also hiding the alterations from the engineering workstation that manages the controller," Armis said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. Put differently, the issues relate to lack of encryption and adequate authentication mechanisms in a proprietary protocol called Control Data Access (CDA) that's used to communicate between Experion Servers and C300 controllers, effectively enabling a threat actor to take over the devices and alter the operation of the DCS controller.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As security practices continue to evolve, one primary concern persists in the minds of security professionals—the risk of employees unintentionally or deliberately exposing vital information. Insider threats, whether originating from deliberate actions or accidental incidents, pose a significant challenge to safeguarding sensitive data. To effectively address insider risks, organizations must adopt a holistic approach that encompasses technical, procedural, and human elements. While access controls, encryption, and monitoring systems are crucial for identifying and mitigating unauthorized access and suspicious activities, the increasing prevalence of cloud-based environments and the surge in SaaS application usage demand a fresh perspective on Insider Risk Management from a SaaS security standpoint. Stay ahead of the game by embracing the SaaS security lens. Join us for an enlightening webinar where we will demonstrate how security practitioners can proactively adapt their approach

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
All-In-One Security (AIOS), a WordPress plugin installed on over one million sites, has issued a security update after a bug introduced in version 5.1.9 of the software caused users' passwords being added to the database in plaintext format. "A malicious site administrator (i.e. a user already logged into the site as an admin) could then have read them," UpdraftPlus, the maintainers of AIOS,&nbsp; said . "This would be a problem if those site administrators were to try out those passwords on other services where your users might have used the same password. If those other services' logins are not protected by two-factor authentication, this could be a risk to the affected website." The issue surfaced nearly three weeks ago when a user of the plugin&nbsp; reported &nbsp;the behavior, stating they were "absolutely shocked that a security plugin is making such a basic security 101 error." AIOS also noted that the updates remove the existing logged data from th

A malicious actor has been linked to a cloud credential stealing campaign in June 2023 that's focused on Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, marking the adversary's expansion in targeting beyond Amazon Web Services (AWS).

They also overlap with an ongoing TeamTNT campaign&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by Aqua called Silentbob that leverages misconfigured cloud services to drop malware as part of what's said to be a testing effort, while also linking&nbsp; SCARLETEEL &nbsp;attacks to the threat actor, citing infrastructure commonalities.

A new malware strain has been found covertly targeting small office/home office (SOHO) routers for more than two years, infiltrating over 70,000 devices and creating a botnet with 40,000 nodes spanning 20 countries. Lumen Black Lotus Labs has dubbed the malware&nbsp; AVrecon , making it the third such strain to focus on SOHO routers after&nbsp; ZuoRAT &nbsp;and&nbsp; HiatusRAT &nbsp;over the past year. "This makes AVrecon one of the largest SOHO router-targeting botnets ever seen," the company&nbsp; said . "The purpose of the campaign appears to be the creation of a covert network to quietly enable a range of criminal activities from password spraying to digital advertising fraud." A majority of the infections are located in the U.K. and the U.S., followed by Argentina, Nigeria, Brazil, Italy, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Russia, and South Africa, among others.

Government entities, military organizations, and civilian users in Ukraine and Poland have been targeted as part of a series of campaigns designed to steal sensitive data and gain persistent remote access to the infected systems.

Fake PoC for Linux Kernel Vulnerability on GitHub Exposes Researchers to Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/blog-post.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In a sign that cybersecurity researchers continue to be under the radar of malicious actors, a proof-of-concept (PoC) has been discovered on GitHub, concealing a backdoor with a "crafty" persistence method. "In this instance, the PoC is a wolf in sheep's clothing, harboring malicious intent under the guise of a harmless learning tool," Uptycs researchers Nischay Hegde and Siddartha Malladi&nbsp; said . "Operating as a downloader, it silently dumps and executes a Linux bash script, all the while disguising its operations as a kernel-level process." The&nbsp; repository &nbsp;masquerades as a PoC for&nbsp; CVE-2023-35829 , a recently disclosed high-severity flaw in the Linux kernel. It has since been taken down, but not before it was forked 25 times.&nbsp; Another PoC &nbsp;shared by the same account, ChriSanders22, for&nbsp; CVE-2023-20871 , a privilege escalation bug impacting VMware Fusion, was forked twice. Uptypcs also identified a&nbsp; second GitHub profile &nbsp;containing a bogus PoC f

Microsoft on Tuesday&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that it repelled a cyber attack staged by a Chinese nation-state actor targeting two dozen organizations, some of which include government agencies, in a cyber espionage campaign designed to acquire confidential data. The attacks, which commenced on May 15, 2023, entailed access to email accounts affecting approximately 25 entities and a small number of related individual consumer accounts. The tech giant attributed the campaign to Storm-0558, describing it as a nation-state activity group based out of China that primarily singles out government agencies in Western Europe. "They focus on espionage, data theft, and credential access," Microsoft&nbsp; said . "They are also known to use custom malware that Microsoft tracks as Cigril and Bling, for credential access." The breach is said to have been detected a month later on June 16, 2023, after an unidentified customer reported the anomalous email activity to the company. Microsoft sai

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a novel rootkit signed by Microsoft that's engineered to communicate with an actor-controlled attack infrastructure. Trend Micro has attributed the activity cluster to the same actor that was previously identified as behind the&nbsp; FiveSys rootkit , which came to light in October 2021. "This malicious actor originates from China and their main victims are the gaming sector in China," Trend Micro's Mahmoud Zohdy, Sherif Magdy, and Mohamed Fahmy&nbsp; said . Their malware seems to have passed through the Windows Hardware Quality Labs ( WHQL ) process for getting a valid signature.

A new fileless attack dubbed&nbsp; PyLoose &nbsp;has been observed striking cloud workloads with the goal of delivering a cryptocurrency miner, new findings from Wiz reveal. "The attack consists of Python code that loads an XMRig Miner directly into memory using&nbsp; memfd , a known Linux fileless technique," security researchers Avigayil Mechtinger, Oren Ofer, and Itamar Gilad&nbsp; said . "This is the first publicly documented Python-based fileless attack targeting cloud workloads in the wild." The cloud security firm said it found nearly 200 instances where the attack method was employed for cryptocurrency mining. No other details about the threat actor are currently known other than the fact that they possess sophisticated capabilities. In the infection chain documented by Wiz, initial access is achieved through the exploitation of a publicly accessible Jupyter Notebook service that allowed for the execution of system commands using Python modules.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Microsoft Windows policy loophole has been observed being exploited primarily by native Chinese-speaking threat actors to forge signatures on kernel-mode drivers. "Actors are leveraging multiple open-source tools that alter the signing date of kernel mode drivers to load malicious and unverified drivers signed with expired certificates," Cisco Talos said in an&nbsp; exhaustive two-part report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News. "This is a major threat, as access to the kernel provides complete access to a system, and therefore total compromise." Following responsible disclosure, Microsoft&nbsp; said &nbsp;it has taken steps to block all certificates to mitigate the threat. It further stated that its investigation found "the activity was limited to the abuse of several developer program accounts and that no Microsoft account compromise has been identified."

Cloud environments continue to be at the receiving end of an ongoing advanced attack campaign dubbed SCARLETEEL, with the threat actors now setting their sights on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Fargate.

SCARLETEEL was&nbsp; first exposed &nbsp;by the cybersecurity company in February 2023, detailing a sophisticated attack chain that culminated in the theft of proprietary data from AWS infrastructure and the deployment of cryptocurrency miners to profit off the compromised systems' resources illegally.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A developing piece of ransomware called&nbsp; Big Head &nbsp;is being distributed as part of a malvertising campaign that takes the form of bogus Microsoft Windows updates and Word installers. Big Head was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs last month, when it discovered multiple variants of the ransomware that are designed to encrypt files on victims' machines in exchange for a cryptocurrency payment. "One Big Head ransomware variant displays a fake Windows Update, potentially indicating that the ransomware was also distributed as a fake Windows Update," Fortinet researchers said at the time. "One of the variants has a Microsoft Word icon and was likely distributed as counterfeit software." A majority of the Big Head samples have been submitted so far from the U.S., Spain, France, and Turkey. In a new analysis of the .NET-based ransomware, Trend Micro detailed its inner workings, calling out its ability to deploy three encrypted binaries: 1.exe to propag

The WebKit bug, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-37450 , could allow threat actors to achieve arbitrary code execution when processing specially crafted web content. The iPhone maker said it addressed the issue with improved checks. Credited with discovering and reporting the flaw is an anonymous researcher. As with most cases like this, there are scant details about the nature and the scale of the attacks and the identity of the threat actor behind them. But Apple noted in a terse advisory that it's "aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited." The updates, iOS 16.5.1 (a), iPadOS 16.5.1 (a), macOS Ventura 13.4.1 (a), and Safari 16.5.2, are available for devices running the following operating system versions: iOS 16.5.1 and iPadOS 16.5.1 macOS Ventura 13.4.1 macOS Big

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Businesses operating in the Latin American (LATAM) region are the target of a new Windows-based banking trojan called&nbsp; TOITOIN &nbsp;since May 2023. "This sophisticated campaign employs a trojan that follows a multi-staged infection chain, utilizing specially crafted modules throughout each stage," Zscaler researchers Niraj Shivtarkar and Preet Kamal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "These modules are custom designed to carry out malicious activities, such as injecting harmful code into remote processes, circumventing User Account Control via COM Elevation Moniker, and evading detection by Sandboxes through clever techniques like system reboots and parent process checks." The six-stage endeavor has all the hallmarks of a well-crafted attack sequence, beginning with a phishing email containing an embedded link that points to a ZIP archive hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance to evade domain-based detections.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Brick-and-mortar retailers and e-commerce sellers may be locked in a fierce battle for market share, but one area both can agree on is the need to secure their SaaS stack. From communications tools to order management and fulfillment systems, much of today's critical retail software lives in SaaS apps in the cloud. Securing those applications is crucial to ongoing operations, chain management, and business continuity.&nbsp; Breaches in retail send out seismic shockwaves. Ten years later, many still remember one national retailer that had 40 million credit card records stolen. Those attacks have continued. According to&nbsp; Verizon's &nbsp;Data Breach Investigations Report, last year saw 629 cybersecurity incidents in the sector. Clearly, retailers must take concrete steps to secure their SaaS stack.&nbsp; And yet, securing applications is complicated. Retailers tend to have multiple tenants of apps, which leads to confusion over which instances of the application were already secured and whic

The threat actors behind the RomCom RAT have been suspected of phishing attacks targeting the&nbsp; upcoming NATO Summit &nbsp;in Vilnius as well as an identified organization supporting Ukraine abroad.

RomCom, also tracked under the names Tropical Scorpius, UNC2596, and Void Rabisu, was recently observed staging cyber attacks against politicians in Ukraine who are working closely with Western countries and a U.S.-based healthcare organization involved with aiding refugees fleeing the war-torn country. Attack chains mounted by the group are geopolitically motivated and have employed spear-phishing emails to point victims to cloned websites hosting trojanized versions of popular software.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors exploited an unknown flaw in Revolut's payment systems to steal more than $20 million of the company's funds in early 2022. The development was&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by the Financial Times, citing multiple unnamed sources with knowledge of the incident. The breach has not been disclosed publicly. The fault stemmed from discrepancies between Revolut's U.S. and European systems, causing funds to be erroneously refunded using its own money when some transactions were declined. The problem was first detected in late 2021. But before it could be closed, the report said organized criminal groups leveraged the loophole by "encouraging individuals to try to make expensive purchases that would go on to be declined." The refunded amounts would then be withdrawn from ATMs. The exact technical details associated with the flaw are currently unclear. About $23 million was stolen in total, with some funds recovered by pursuing those who had withdrawn cash. The mass

Two Spyware Apps on Google Play with 1.5 Million Users Sending Data to China<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/two-spyware-apps-on-google-play-with-15.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two file management apps on the Google Play Store have been discovered to be spyware, putting the privacy and security of up to 1.5 million Android users at risk. These apps engage in deceptive behaviour and secretly send sensitive user data to malicious servers in China. Pradeo, a leading mobile security company, has uncovered this alarming infiltration. The report shows that both spyware apps, namely File Recovery and Data Recovery (com.spot.music.filedate) with over 1 million installs, and File Manager (com.file.box.master.gkd) with over 500,000 installs, are developed by the same group. These seemingly harmless Android apps use similar malicious tactics and automatically launch when the device reboots without user input. Contrary to what they claim on the Google Play Store, where both apps assure users that no data is collected, Pradeo's analytics engine has found that various personal information is collected without users' knowledge. Stolen data includes contact list

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have issued a warning about an emerging and advanced form of voice phishing ( vishing ) known as " Letscall ." This technique is currently targeting individuals in South Korea. The criminals behind "Letscall" employ a multi-step attack to deceive victims into downloading malicious apps from a counterfeit Google Play Store website. Once the malicious software is installed, it redirects incoming calls to a call center under the control of the criminals. Trained operators posing as bank employees then extract sensitive information from unsuspecting victims. To facilitate the routing of voice traffic, "Letscall" utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as voice over IP (VOIP) and WebRTC. It also makes use of Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) and Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) protocols, including Google STUN servers, to ensure high-quality phone or video calls and bypass NAT and firewall restrictions.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Progress Software has announced the discovery and patching of a critical SQL injection vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer, popular software used for secure file transfer. In addition, Progress Software has patched two other high-severity vulnerabilities. The identified SQL injection vulnerability, tagged as CVE-2023-36934 , could potentially allow unauthenticated attackers to gain unauthorized access to the MOVEit Transfer database. SQL injection vulnerabilities are a well-known and dangerous security flaw that allows attackers to manipulate databases and run any code they want. Attackers can send specifically designed payloads to certain endpoints of the affected application, which could change or expose sensitive data in the database. The reason CVE-2023-36934 is so critical is that it can be exploited without having to be logged in. This means that even attackers without valid credentials can potentially exploit the vulnerability. However, as of now, there have been no reports of

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mastodon, a popular decentralized social network, has released a security update to fix critical vulnerabilities that could expose millions of users to potential attacks. Mastodon is known for its federated model, consisting of thousands of separate servers called "instances," and it has over 14 million users across more than 20,000 instances. The most critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-36460 , allows hackers to exploit a flaw in the media attachments feature, creating and overwriting files in any location the software could access on an instance. This software vulnerability could be used for DoS and arbitrary remote code execution attacks, posing a significant threat to users and the broader Internet ecosystem. If an attacker gains control over multiple instances, they could cause harm by instructing users to download malicious applications or even bring down the entire Mastodon infrastructure. Fortunately, there is no evidence of this vulnerability being exploited so fa

CISOs, security leaders, and SOC teams often struggle with limited visibility into all connections made to their company-owned assets and networks. They are hindered by a lack of open-source intelligence and powerful technology required for proactive, continuous, and effective discovery and protection of their systems, data, and assets. As advanced threat actors constantly search for easily exploitable vulnerabilities around the clock, CISOs are in pursuit of improved methods to reduce threat exposures and safeguard their assets, users, and data from relentless cyber-attacks and the severe consequences of breaches. In response to this need, an emerging solution addressing the most critical priorities at the initial stage of the attack chain has provided security leaders with a new tool to manage their most pressing threat exposures at their origin.

Ransomware attacks are a major problem for organizations everywhere, and the severity of this problem continues to intensify. Recently, Microsoft's Incident Response team investigated the BlackByte 2.0 ransomware attacks and exposed these cyber strikes' terrifying velocity and damaging nature. The findings indicate that hackers can complete the entire attack process, from gaining initial access to causing significant damage, in just five days. They waste no time infiltrating systems, encrypting important data, and demanding a ransom to release it. This shortened timeline poses a significant challenge for organizations trying to protect themselves against these harmful operations. BlackByte ransomware is used in the final stage of the attack, using an 8-digit number key to encrypt the data. To carry out these attacks, hackers use a powerful combination of tools and techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has released its monthly security updates for the Android operating system, addressing 46 new software vulnerabilities. Among these, three vulnerabilities have been identified as actively exploited in targeted attacks. One of the vulnerabilities tracked as CVE-2023-26083 is a memory leak flaw affecting the Arm Mali GPU driver for Bifrost, Avalon, and Valhall chips. This particular vulnerability was exploited in a previous attack that enabled spyware infiltration on Samsung devices in December 2022. This vulnerability was regarded as serious enough to prompt the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue a patching order for federal agencies in April 2023. Another significant vulnerability, identified as CVE-2021-29256, is a high-severity issue that affects specific versions of the Bifrost and Midgard Arm Mali GPU kernel drivers. This flaw permits an unprivileged user to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and escalate privileges to the root lev

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity agencies have warned about the emergence of new variants of the TrueBot malware. This enhanced threat is now targeting companies in the U.S. and Canada with the intention of extracting confidential data from infiltrated systems. These sophisticated attacks exploit a critical vulnerability ( CVE-2022-31199 ) in the widely used Netwrix Auditor server and its associated agents. This vulnerability enables unauthorized attackers to execute malicious code with the SYSTEM user's privileges, granting them unrestricted access to compromised systems. The TrueBot malware , linked with cybercriminal collectives Silence and FIN11, is deployed to siphon off data and disseminate ransomware, jeopardising the safety of numerous infiltrated networks. The cybercriminals gain their initial foothold by exploiting the cited vulnerability, then proceed to install TrueBot. Once they have breached the networks, they install the FlawedGrace Remote Access Trojan (RAT) to escalate their p

The Iranian nation-state actor known as TA453 has been linked to a new set of spear-phishing attacks that infect both Windows and macOS operating systems with malware. "TA453 eventually used a variety of cloud hosting providers to deliver a novel infection chain that deploys the newly identified PowerShell backdoor GorjolEcho," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "When given the opportunity, TA453 ported its malware and attempted to launch an Apple flavored infection chain dubbed NokNok. TA453 also employed&nbsp; multi-persona impersonation &nbsp;in its unending espionage quest." TA453, also known by the names APT35, Charming Kitten, Mint Sandstorm, and Yellow Garuda, is a threat group linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) that has been active since at least 2011. Most recently, Volexity highlighted the adversary's use of an updated version of a Powershell implant called&nbsp; CharmPower &nbsp;(aka GhostEcho or POWERSTAR). In the attack sequence discove

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a newly identified security flaw in the Linux kernel that could allow a user to gain elevated privileges on a target host. Dubbed&nbsp; StackRot &nbsp;( CVE-2023-3269 , CVSS score: 7.8), the flaw impacts Linux versions 6.1 through 6.4. There is no evidence that the shortcoming has been exploited in the wild to date. "As StackRot is a Linux kernel vulnerability found in the memory management subsystem, it affects almost all kernel configurations and requires minimal capabilities to trigger," Peking University security researcher Ruihan Li&nbsp; said . "However, it should be noted that maple nodes are freed using RCU callbacks, delaying the actual memory deallocation until after the RCU grace period. Consequently, exploiting this vulnerability is considered challenging." Following&nbsp; responsible disclosure &nbsp;on June 15, 2023, it has been&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;in stable versions 6.1.37, 6.3.11, and 6.4.1 as of July 1, 2023, after a two-week effort led by Linus Tor

As technology advances and organizations become more reliant on data, the risks associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks also increase. The introduction of data privacy laws, such as the GDPR, has made it mandatory for organizations to disclose breaches of personal data to those affected. As such, it has become essential for businesses to protect themselves from the financial and reputational costs of cyber incidents. One solution to help organizations protect themselves is cyber insurance, despite the rising costs of cyber insurance, where the average&nbsp; price in the U.S. rose 79% &nbsp;in the second quarter of 2022. Also, with strict eligibility requirements that have emerged in response to risk and sharp spikes in successful breaches during and post-COVID-19, cyber insurance remains essential for organizations to protect sensitive customer information and their own data from falling into the wrong hands. While cyber insurance is not a one-size-fits-all solution and may not cover

Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed an attack infrastructure that's being used as part of a "potentially massive campaign" against cloud-native environments.

The activity, dubbed&nbsp; Silentbob &nbsp;in reference to an AnonDNS domain set up by the attacker, is said to be linked to the infamous cryptojacking group tracked as&nbsp; TeamTNT , citing overlaps in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). However, the involvement of an "advanced copycat" hasn't been ruled out.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A sophisticated stealer-as-a-ransomware threat dubbed&nbsp; RedEnergy &nbsp;has been spotted in the wild targeting energy utilities, oil, gas, telecom, and machinery sectors in Brazil and the Philippines through their LinkedIn pages. The malware "possesses the ability to steal information from various browsers, enabling the exfiltration of sensitive data, while also incorporating different modules for carrying out ransomware activities," Zscaler researchers Shatak Jain and Gurkirat Singh&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a recent analysis. The goal, the researchers noted, is to couple data theft with encryption with the goal of inflicting maximum damage to the victims. The starting point for the multi-stage attack is a&nbsp; FakeUpdates &nbsp;(aka SocGholish) campaign that tricks users into downloading JavaScript-based malware under the guise of web browser updates. What makes it novel is the use of reputable LinkedIn pages to target victims, redirecting users clicking on the website URLs to a bogus landing page

Secrets are meant to be hidden or, at the very least, only known to a specific and limited set of individuals (or systems). Otherwise, they aren't really secrets. In personal life, a secret revealed can damage relationships, lead to social stigma, or, at the very least, be embarrassing. In a developer's or application security engineer's professional life, the consequences of exposing secrets can lead to breaches of security, data leaks, and, well, also be embarrassing. And while there are tools available for detecting source code and code repositories, there are few options for identifying secrets in plain text, documents, emails, chat logs, content management systems, and more. What Are Secrets? In the context of applications, secrets are sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, cryptographic keys, and other confidential data that an application needs to function but should not be exposed to unauthorized users. Secrets are typically stored securely and access

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The npm registry for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment is susceptible to what's called a&nbsp; manifest confusion &nbsp;attack that could potentially allow threat actors to conceal malware in project dependencies or perform arbitrary script execution during installation. "A npm package's manifest is published independently from its tarball," Darcy Clarke, a former GitHub and npm engineering manager,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published last week. "Manifests are never fully validated against the tarball's contents." "The ecosystem has broadly assumed the contents of the manifest and tarball are consistent," Clarke added. The problem, at its core, stems from the fact that the manifest and package metadata are decoupled and that they are never cross-referenced against one another, thereby leading to unexpected behavior and misuse when there is a mismatch. As a result, a threat actor could exploit this loophole to publish a module with a ma

Instagram Threads, the upcoming Twitter competitor from Meta, will not be launched in the European Union due to privacy concerns, according to Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC). The development was&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by the Irish Independent, which said the watchdog has been in contact with the social media giant about the new product and confirmed the release won't extend to the E.U. "at this point." Threads &nbsp;is Meta's answer to Twitter that's set for launch on July 6, 2023. It's billed as a "text-based conversation app" that allows Instagram users to "discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what'll be trending tomorrow." It also enables users to follow the same accounts they already follow on Instagram. A listing for the app has already appeared in the&nbsp; Apple App Store &nbsp;and&nbsp; Google Play Store , although it's yet to be available for download.

The Swedish data protection watchdog has warned companies against using Google Analytics due to risks posed by U.S. government surveillance, following similar moves by&nbsp; Austria, France , and&nbsp; Italy &nbsp;last year. The development comes in the aftermath of an audit initiated by the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) against four companies CDON, Coop, Dagens Industri, and Tele2. "In its audits, IMY considers that the data transferred to the U.S. via Google's statistics tool is personal data because the data can be linked with other unique data that is transferred," IMY&nbsp; said . "The authority also concludes that the technical security measures that the companies have taken are not sufficient to ensure a level of protection that essentially corresponds to that guaranteed within the EU/EEA." The data protection authority also fined $1.1 million for Swedish telecom service provider Tele2 and less than $30,000 for local online marketplace CDON failing to

An e-crime actor of Mexican provenance has been linked to an Android mobile malware campaign targeting financial institutions globally, but with a specific focus on Spanish and Chilean banks, from June 2021 to April 2023.

The findings were published by SentinelOne following a Malware Research Challenge in collaboration with vx-underground.

No less than 330,000 FortiGate firewalls are still unpatched and vulnerable to CVE-2023-27997, a critical security flaw affecting Fortinet devices that has come under active exploitation in the wild. Cybersecurity firm Bishop Fox, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;published last week, said that out of nearly 490,000 Fortinet SSL-VPN interfaces exposed on the internet, about 69 percent remain unpatched. CVE-2023-27997 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), also called XORtigate, is a critical vulnerability impacting Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy SSL-VPN appliances that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands via specifically crafted requests. Patches were released by Fortinet last month in versions 6.0.17, 6.2.15, 6.4.13, 7.0.12, and 7.2.5, although the company&nbsp; acknowledged &nbsp;that the flaw may have been "exploited in a limited number of cases" in attacks targeting government, manufacturing, and critical infrastructure sectors.

Chinese Hackers Use HTML Smuggling to Infiltrate European Ministries with PlugX<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/chinese-hackers-use-html-smuggling-to.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese nation-state group has been observed targeting Foreign Affairs ministries and embassies in Europe using&nbsp; HTML smuggling techniques &nbsp;to deliver the PlugX remote access trojan on compromised systems. Cybersecurity firm Check Point said the activity, dubbed&nbsp; SmugX , has been ongoing since at least December 2022. "The campaign uses new delivery methods to deploy (most notably – HTML Smuggling) a new variant of PlugX, an implant commonly associated with a wide variety of Chinese threat actors," Check Point&nbsp; said . "Although the payload itself remains similar to the one found in older PlugX variants, its delivery methods result in low detection rates, which until recently helped the campaign fly under the radar." The exact identity of the threat actor behind the operation is a little hazy, although existing clues point in the direction of&nbsp; Mustang Panda , which also shares overlaps with clusters tracked as Earth Preta, RedDelta, and Check Point's own d

In yet another sign of a lucrative crimeware-as-a-service ( CaaS ) ecosystem, cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new Windows-based information stealer called&nbsp; Meduza Stealer &nbsp;that's actively being developed by its author to evade detection by software solutions. "The Meduza Stealer has a singular objective: comprehensive data theft," Uptycs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "It pilfers users' browsing activities, extracting a wide array of browser-related data." "From critical login credentials to the valuable record of browsing history and meticulously curated bookmarks, no digital artifact is safe. Even crypto wallet extensions, password managers, and 2FA extensions are vulnerable." Despite the similarity in features, Meduza boasts of a "crafty" operational design that eschews the use of obfuscation techniques and promptly terminates its execution on compromised hosts should a connection to the attacker's server fail.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the&nbsp; BlackCat ransomware &nbsp;have been observed employing malvertising tricks to distribute rogue installers of the WinSCP file transfer application. "Malicious actors used malvertising to distribute a piece of malware via cloned webpages of legitimate organizations," Trend Micro researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. "In this case, the distribution involved a webpage of the well-known application WinSCP, an open-source Windows application for file transfer." Malvertising &nbsp; refers &nbsp;to the use of&nbsp; SEO poisoning techniques &nbsp;to spread malware via online advertising. It typically involves hijacking a chosen set of keywords to display bogus ads on Bing and Google search results pages with the goal of redirecting unsuspecting users to sketchy pages. The idea is to trick users searching for applications like WinSCP into downloading malware, in this instance, a backdoor that contains a&nbsp; Cobalt Strike Beacon &nbsp;that connects to a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have pulled back the curtain on an updated version of an Apple macOS malware called RustBucket that comes with improved&nbsp;capabilities to establish persistence and avoid detection by security software. "This variant of RustBucket, a malware family that targets macOS systems, adds persistence capabilities not previously observed," Elastic Security Labs researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week, adding it's "leveraging a dynamic network infrastructure methodology for command-and-control." RustBucket is the work of a North Korean threat actor known as BlueNoroff, which is part of a larger intrusion set tracked under the name&nbsp; Lazarus Group , an elite hacking unit supervised by the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), the country's primary intelligence agency. The malware came to light in April 2023, when Jamf Threat Labs&nbsp; described &nbsp;it as an AppleScript-based backdoor capable of retrieving a second-stage payload from a remote server. Elas

Charming Kitten, the nation-state actor affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has been attributed to a bespoke spear-phishing campaign that delivers an updated version of a fully-featured PowerShell backdoor called POWERSTAR. "There have been improved operational security measures placed in the malware to make it more difficult to analyze and collect intelligence," Volexity researchers Ankur Saini and Charlie Gardner said in a report published this week. The threat actor is something of an expert when it comes to employing social engineering to lure targets, often crafting tailored fake personas on social media platforms and engaging in sustained conversations to build rapport before sending a malicious link. It's also tracked under the names APT35, Cobalt Illusion, Mint Sandstorm (formerly Phosphorus), and Yellow Garuda. Recent intrusions orchestrated by Charming Kitten have made use of other implants such as PowerLess and BellaCiao

Meta's WhatsApp has rolled out updates to its proxy feature, allowing more flexibility in the kind of content that can be shared in conversations. This includes the ability to send and receive images, voice notes, files, stickers and GIFs, WhatsApp told The Hacker News. The new features were&nbsp; first reported &nbsp;by BBC Persian. Some of the other improvements include streamlined steps to simplify the setup process as well as the introduction of shareable links to "share functioning/valid proxy addresses to their contacts for easy and automatic installation." Support for&nbsp; proxy servers &nbsp;was officially launched by the messaging service&nbsp; earlier this January , thereby helping users circumvent government-imposed censorship and internet shutdowns and obtain indirect access to WhatsApp. The company has also made available a&nbsp; reference implementation &nbsp;for setting up a proxy server with ports 80, 443 or 5222 available and domain name that points to the server's IP address. &amp;

Cybercriminals Hijacking Vulnerable SSH Servers in New Proxyjacking Campaign<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/cybercriminals-hijacking-vulnerable-ssh.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An active financially motivated campaign is targeting vulnerable SSH servers to covertly ensnare them into a proxy network. "This is an active campaign in which the attacker leverages SSH for remote access, running malicious scripts that stealthily enlist victim servers into a peer-to-peer (P2P) proxy network, such as Peer2Profit or Honeygain," Akamai researcher Allen West said in a Thursday report. Unlike cryptojacking, in which a compromised system's resources are used to illicitly mine cryptocurrency, proxyjacking offers the ability for threat actors to leverage the victim's unused bandwidth to covertly run different services as a P2P node. This offers two-fold benefits: It not only enables the attacker to monetize the extra bandwidth with a significantly reduced resource load that would be necessary to carry out cryptojacking, it also reduces the chances of discovery. "It is a stealthier alternative to cryptojacking and has serious implications that ca

MITRE has released its annual list of the Top 25 "most dangerous software weaknesses" for the year 2023. "These weaknesses lead to serious vulnerabilities in software," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&nbsp; said . "An attacker can often exploit these vulnerabilities to take control of an affected system, steal data, or prevent applications from working." The&nbsp; list &nbsp;is based on an&nbsp; analysis &nbsp;of public vulnerability data in the National Vulnerability Data ( NVD ) for root cause mappings to CWE weaknesses for the previous two years. A total of 43,996 CVE entries were examined and a score was attached to each of them based on prevalence and severity. Coming out top is Out-of-bounds Write, followed by Cross-site Scripting, SQL Injection, Use After Free, OS Command Injection, Improper Input Validation, Out-of-bounds Read, Path Traversal, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian state-sponsored group dubbed MuddyWater has been attributed to a previously unseen command-and-control (C2) framework called&nbsp; PhonyC2 &nbsp;that's been put to use by the actor since 2021. Evidence shows that the custom made, actively developed framework has been leveraged in the&nbsp; February 2023 attack on Technion , an Israeli research institute, cybersecurity firm Deep Instinct said in a report shared with The Hacker News. What's more, additional links have been unearthed between the Python 3-based program and other attacks carried out by MuddyWater, including the&nbsp; ongoing exploitation of PaperCut servers . "It is structurally and functionally similar to&nbsp; MuddyC3 , a previous MuddyWater&nbsp; custom C2 framework &nbsp;that was written in Python 2," security researcher Simon Kenin said. "MuddyWater is continuously updating the PhonyC2 framework and changing TTPs to avoid detection." MuddyWater, also known as Mango Sandstorm (previously Mercury), is a cyber

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cyber threat intelligence is an effective weapon in the ongoing battle to protect digital assets and infrastructure - especially when combined with AI. But AI is only as good as the data feeding it. Access to unique, underground sources is key. Threat Intelligence offers tremendous value to people and companies. At the same time, its ability to address organizations' cybersecurity needs and the benefits it offers vary by company, industry, and other factors. A common challenge with cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is that the data it produces can be vast and overwhelming, creating confusion and inefficiencies among security teams' threat exposure management efforts. Additionally, organizations have different levels of security maturity, which can make access to and understanding of CTI data difficult. Enter generative AI. Many cybersecurity companies – and more specifically, threat intelligence companies – are bringing generative AI to market to simplify threat intelligence a

North Korean Hacker Group Andariel Strikes with New EarlyRat Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/north-korean-hacker-group-andariel.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korea-aligned threat actor known as Andariel leveraged a previously undocumented malware called EarlyRat in attacks exploiting the Log4j Log4Shell vulnerability last year. "Andariel infects machines by executing a Log4j exploit, which, in turn, downloads further malware from the command-and-control (C2) server," Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. Also called Silent Chollima and Stonefly, Andariel is associated with North Korea's Lab 110, a primary hacking unit that also houses&nbsp; APT38 &nbsp;(aka BlueNoroff ) and other subordinate elements collectively tracked under the umbrella name&nbsp; Lazarus Group .&nbsp; The threat actor, besides conducting espionage attacks against foreign government and military entities that are of strategic interest, is known to&nbsp; carry out cyber crime &nbsp;as an extra source of income to the sanctions-hit nation. Some of the key cyber weapons in its arsenal include a ransomware strain referred to as&nbsp; Maui &nbsp;and numerous remote access trojans and backd

Android-based phone monitoring app LetMeSpy has disclosed a security breach that allowed an unauthorized third-party to steal sensitive data associated with thousands of Android users. "As a result of the attack, the criminals gained access to email addresses, telephone numbers and the content of messages collected on accounts," LetMeSpy&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an announcement on its website, noting the incident took place on June 21, 2023. Following the discovery of the hack, LetMeSpy said it notified law enforcement and data protection authorities. It's also taking steps to suspend all account-related functions until further notice. The identity of the threat actor and their motives are currently unknown.

Critical Security Flaw in Social Login Plugin for WordPress Exposes Users' Accounts<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/critical-security-flaw-in-social-login.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical security flaw has been disclosed in miniOrange's&nbsp; Social Login and Register plugin &nbsp;for WordPress that could enable a malicious actor to log in as any user-provided information about email address is already known. Tracked as CVE-2023-2982 (CVSS score: 9.8), the authentication bypass flaw impacts all versions of the plugin, including and prior to 7.6.4. It was addressed on June 14, 2023, with the release of version 7.6.5 following responsible disclosure on June 2, 2023. "The vulnerability makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to any account on a site including accounts used to administer the site, if the attacker knows, or can find, the associated email address," Wordfence researcher István Márton&nbsp; said . The issue is rooted in the fact that the encryption key used to secure the information during login using social media accounts is hard-coded, thus leading to a scenario where attackers could create a valid request with a properl

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Windows-based information stealer called&nbsp; ThirdEye &nbsp;has been discovered in the wild with capabilities to harvest sensitive data from infected hosts. Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, which&nbsp; made the discovery , said it found the malware in an executable that masqueraded as a&nbsp; PDF file &nbsp;with a Russian name "CMK Правила оформления больничных листов.pdf.exe," which translates to "CMK Rules for issuing sick leaves.pdf.exe." The arrival vector for the malware is presently unknown, although the nature of the lure points to it being used in a phishing campaign. The very&nbsp; first ThirdEye sample &nbsp;was uploaded to VirusTotal on April 4, 2023, with relatively fewer features. The evolving stealer, like&nbsp; other malware families &nbsp;of its kind, is equipped to gather system metadata, including BIOS release date and vendor, total/free disk space on the C drive, currently running processes, register usernames, and volume information.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Drones that don't have any known security weaknesses could be the target of electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) attacks, potentially enabling a threat actor to achieve arbitrary code execution and compromise their functionality and safety. The research comes from IOActive, which&nbsp; found &nbsp;that it is "feasible to compromise the targeted device by injecting a specific EM glitch at the right time during a firmware update." "This would allow an attacker to gain code execution on the main processor, gaining access to the Android OS that implements the core functionality of the drone," Gabriel Gonzalez, director of hardware security at the company, said in a report published this month. The&nbsp; study , which was undertaken to determine the current security posture of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), was carried out on&nbsp; Mavic Pro , a popular quadcopter drone manufactured by DJI that employs various security features like signed and encrypted firmware, Trusted Executi

5 Things CISOs Need to Know About Securing OT Environments<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/5-things-cisos-need-to-know-about.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For too long the cybersecurity world focused exclusively on information technology (IT), leaving operational technology (OT) to fend for itself. Traditionally, few industrial enterprises had dedicated cybersecurity leaders. Any security decisions that arose fell to the plant and factory managers, who are highly skilled technical experts in other areas but often lack cybersecurity training or knowledge. In more recent years, an uptick in cyberattacks against industrial facilities and the trend of IT/OT convergence driven by Industry 4.0 have highlighted the vacuum of ownership around OT security.&nbsp; According to a new Fortinet report , most organizations are looking to Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) to solve the problem. Fortunately, CISOs are no strangers to change or difficult challenges. The position itself is less than 20 years old, yet in those two decades CISOs have navigated some of the most disruptive cybersecurity events that were truly watershed moments in techno

8Base Ransomware Spikes in Activity, Threatens U.S. and Brazilian Businesses<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/8base-ransomware-spikes-in-activity.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A ransomware threat called 8Base that has been operating under the radar for over a year has been attributed to a "massive spike in activity" in May and June 2023. "The group utilizes encryption paired with 'name-and-shame' techniques to compel their victims to pay their ransoms," VMware Carbon Black researchers Deborah Snyder and Fae Carlisle&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "8Base has an opportunistic pattern of compromise with recent victims spanning across varied industries." 8Base, according to statistics gathered by&nbsp; Malwarebytes &nbsp;and&nbsp; NCC Group , has been linked to 67 attacks as of May 2023, with about 50% of the victims&nbsp; operating &nbsp;in the business services, manufacturing, and construction sectors. A majority of the targeted companies are located in the U.S. and Brazil. With very little known about the operators of the ransomware, its origins remain something of a cipher. What's evident is that it has been active sinc

Critical SQL Injection Flaws Expose Gentoo Soko to Remote Code Execution<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/critical-sql-injection-flaws-expose.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Gentoo Soko that could lead to remote code execution (RCE) on vulnerable systems. "These SQL injections happened despite the use of an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library and prepared statements," SonarSource researcher Thomas Chauchefoin&nbsp; said , adding they could result in RCE on Soko because of a "misconfiguration of the database." The&nbsp; two &nbsp; issues , which were discovered in the search feature of Soko, have been collectively tracked as CVE-2023-28424 (CVSS score: 9.1). They were addressed within 24 hours of responsible disclosure on March 17, 2023. Soko is a Go software module that powers&nbsp; packages.gentoo.org , offering users an easy way to search through different Portage packages that are available for Gentoo Linux distribution. But the shortcomings identified in the service meant that it could have been possible for a malicious actor to&nbsp; inject specially crafted code , resulting in the expo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new process injection technique dubbed Mockingjay could be exploited by threat actors to bypass security solutions to execute malicious code on compromised systems. "The injection is executed without space allocation, setting permissions or even starting a thread," Security Joes researchers Thiago Peixoto, Felipe Duarte, and Ido Naor&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The uniqueness of this technique is that it requires a vulnerable DLL and copying code to the right section." Process injection is an&nbsp; attack method &nbsp;that allows adversaries to inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses and elevate privileges. In doing so, it could allow for the execution of arbitrary code in the memory space of a separate live process. Some of the well-known process injection techniques include dynamic link library (DLL) injection, portable executable injection, thread execution hijacking, process hollowing, and process doppelgänging, amon

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new ongoing campaign aimed at the npm&nbsp;ecosystem that leverages a unique execution chain to deliver an unknown payload to targeted systems. "The packages in question seem to be published in pairs, each pair working in unison to fetch additional resources which are subsequently decoded and/or executed," software supply chain security firm Phylum&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report released last week. To that end, the order in which the pair of packages are installed is paramount to pulling off a successful attack, as the first of the two modules are designed to store locally a token retrieved from a remote server. The campaign was first discovered on June 11, 2023. The second package subsequently passes this token as a parameter alongside the operating system type to an&nbsp; HTTP GET request &nbsp;to acquire a second script from the remote server. A successful execution returns a Base64-encoded string that is immediately executed but only if that string is

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the business environment becomes increasingly connected, organizations' attack surfaces continue to expand, making it challenging to map and secure both known and unknown assets. In particular, unknown assets present security challenges related to shadow IT, misconfigurations, ineffective scan coverage, among others. Given attack surface sprawl and evolving threats, many organizations are embracing&nbsp; attack surface management (ASM) &nbsp;tools to discover and address critical exposures. Asset discovery is an important capability to have, and one that's helping to drive the adoption of attack surface management tools and services. That said, asset discovery is only one aspect of effective attack surface management. Making the attack surface as impenetrable as possible takes offensive security that goes far beyond the discovery phase. Why Asset Discovery Isn't Enough&nbsp; Given the complexity and ever-expanding scale of the digital infrastructure at most companies, cataloging all the known

A new Android malware campaign has been observed pushing the Anatsa banking trojan to target banking customers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria, and Switzerland since the start of March 2023. "The actors behind Anatsa aim to steal credentials used to authorize customers in mobile banking applications and perform Device-Takeover Fraud (DTO) to initiate fraudulent transactions," ThreatFabric&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published Monday. The Dutch cybersecurity company said Anatsa-infected Google Play Store&nbsp; dropper apps &nbsp;have accrued over 30,000 installations to date, indicating that the official app storefront has become an effective distribution vector for the malware. Anatsa, also known by the name TeaBot and Toddler, first&nbsp; emerged &nbsp;in&nbsp; early 2021 , and has been observed&nbsp; masquerading &nbsp;as&nbsp; seemingly innocuous utility apps &nbsp;like PDF readers, QR code scanners, and two-factor authentication (2FA) apps on Google Play to siphon users' credentials.

Researchers Find Way to Recover Cryptographic Keys by Analyzing LED Flickers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/researchers-find-way-to-recover.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's an ingenious&nbsp; side-channel attack , a group of academics has found that it's possible to recover secret keys from a device by analyzing video footage of its power LED. "Cryptographic computations performed by the CPU change the power consumption of the device which affects the brightness of the device's power LED," researchers from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Cornell University&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a study. By taking advantage of this observation, it's possible for threat actors to leverage video camera devices such as an iPhone 13 or an internet-connected surveillance camera to extract the cryptographic keys from a smart card reader­. Specifically, video-based cryptanalysis is accomplished by obtaining video footage of rapid changes in an LED's brightness and exploiting the video camera's&nbsp; rolling shutter &nbsp;effect to capture the physical emanations. "This is caused by the fact that the power LED is connected directly to the pow

Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Falls Victim to JokerSpy macOS Backdoor Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/japanese-cryptocurrency-exchange-falls.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown cryptocurrency exchange located in Japan was the target of a new attack earlier this month to deploy an Apple macOS backdoor called JokerSpy. Elastic Security Labs, which is monitoring the intrusion set under the name&nbsp; REF9134 ,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the attack led to the installation of Swiftbelt, a Swift-based enumeration tool inspired by an open-source utility called&nbsp; SeatBelt . JokerSky was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Bitdefender last week, describing it as a sophisticated toolkit designed to breach macOS machines. Very little is known about the threat actor behind the operation other than the fact that the attacks leverage a set of programs written in Python and Swift that come with capabilities to gather data and execute arbitrary commands on compromised hosts. A primary component of the toolkit is a self-signed multi-architecture binary known as xcc that's engineered to check for FullDiskAccess and ScreenRecording permissions. The file is signed as XProtectCheck, indicating an

Security and IT teams are routinely forced to adopt software before fully understanding the security risks. And AI tools are no exception. Employees and business leaders alike are flocking to generative AI software and similar programs, often unaware of the major SaaS security vulnerabilities they're introducing into the enterprise. A February 2023&nbsp; generative AI survey of 1,000 executives &nbsp;revealed that 49% of respondents use ChatGPT now, and 30% plan to tap into the ubiquitous generative AI tool soon. Ninety-nine percent of those using ChatGPT claimed some form of cost-savings, and 25% attested to reducing expenses by $75,000 or more. As the researchers conducted this survey a mere three months after ChatGPT's general availability, today's ChatGPT and AI tool usage is undoubtedly higher.&nbsp; Security and risk teams are already overwhelmed protecting their SaaS estate (which has now become the operating system of business) from common vulnerabilities such as misconfigurati

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has&nbsp; added &nbsp;a batch of six flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. This comprises three vulnerabilities that Apple patched this week ( CVE-2023-32434, CVE-2023-32435, and CVE-2023-32439 ), two flaws in VMware ( CVE-2023-20867 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-20887 ), and one shortcoming impacting Zyxel devices ( CVE-2023-27992 ). CVE-2023-32434 and CVE-2023-32435, both of which allow code execution, are said to have been exploited as zero-days to deploy spyware as part of a years-long cyber espionage campaign that commenced in 2019. Dubbed Operation Triangulation, the activity culminates in the deployment of&nbsp; TriangleDB &nbsp;that's designed to harvest a wide range of information from compromised devices, such as creating, modifying, removing, and stealing files, listing and terminating processes, gathering credentials from iCloud Keychain, and tracking a user's location.

A U.K. citizen who took part in the massive July 2020 hack of Twitter has been sentenced to five years in prison in the U.S. Joseph James O'Connor (aka PlugwalkJoe), 24, was awarded the sentence on Friday in the Southern District of New York, a little over a month&nbsp; after &nbsp;he&nbsp; pleaded guilty &nbsp;to the criminal schemes. He was&nbsp; arrested &nbsp;in Spain in July 2021. The infamous Twitter breach allowed the defendant and his co-conspirators to obtain unauthorized access to backend tools used by Twitter, abusing them to hijack 130 popular accounts to perpetrate a crypto scam that netted them about $120,000 in illegal profits. "In other instances, the co-conspirators sold access to Twitter accounts to others," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)&nbsp; said . "O'Connor communicated with others regarding purchasing unauthorized access to a variety of Twitter accounts, including accounts associated with public figures around the world."

Cybercrime Group 'Muddled Libra' Targets BPO Sector with Advanced Social Engineering<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/cybercrime-group-muddled-libra-targets.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor known as&nbsp; Muddled Libra &nbsp;is targeting the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry with persistent attacks that leverage advanced social engineering ploys to gain initial access. "The attack style defining Muddled Libra appeared on the cybersecurity radar in late 2022 with the release of the 0ktapus phishing kit, which offered a prebuilt hosting framework and bundled templates," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. Libra is the&nbsp; designation &nbsp;given by the cybersecurity company for cybercrime groups. The "muddled" moniker for the threat actor stems from the prevailing ambiguity with regards to the use of the 0ktapus framework. 0ktapus , also known as Scatter Swine, refers to an intrusion set that first came to light in August 2022 in connection with smishing attacks against over 100 organizations, including Twilio and Cloudflare. Then in late 2022, CrowdStrike&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;a string of cyber assaults aimed at telecom and BPO co

The case for browser fingerprinting: personalizing user experience, improving fraud detection, and optimizing login security Have you ever heard of browser fingerprinting? You should! It's an online user identification technique that collects information about a visitor's web browser and its configuration preferences to associate individual browsing sessions with a single website visitor.&nbsp; With browser fingerprinting, many pieces of data can be collected about a user's web browser and device, such as screen resolution, location, language, and operating system. When you stitch these pieces together, they reveal a unique combination of information that forms every user's visitor ID or "digital fingerprint." Websites can use the visitor ID in various ways, including personalizing the user's experience, improving fraud detection, and optimizing login security.

Powerful JavaScript Dropper PindOS Distributes Bumblebee and IcedID Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/powerful-javascript-dropper-pindos.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new strain of JavaScript dropper has been observed delivering next-stage payloads like Bumblebee and IcedID. Cybersecurity firm Deep Instinct is tracking the malware as&nbsp; PindOS , which contains the name in its " User-Agent " string. Both&nbsp; Bumblebee &nbsp;and IcedID serve as loaders, acting as a vector for other malware on compromised hosts, including ransomware. A recent report from Proofpoint&nbsp; highlighted &nbsp;IcedID's abandoning of banking fraud features to solely focus on malware delivery. Bumblebee , notably, is a replacement for another loader called&nbsp; BazarLoader , which has been attributed to the now-defunct TrickBot and Conti groups. A report from Secureworks in April 2022&nbsp; found &nbsp;evidence of collaboration between several actors in the Russian cybercrime ecosystem, including that of&nbsp; Conti ,&nbsp; Emotet , and IcedID.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) on Thursday released guidance to help organizations detect and prevent infections of a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) bootkit called&nbsp; BlackLotus . To that end, the agency is&nbsp; recommending &nbsp;that "infrastructure owners take action by hardening user executable policies and monitoring the integrity of the boot partition." BlackLotus is an&nbsp; advanced &nbsp;crimeware solution that was first spotlighted in October 2022 by Kaspersky. A UEFI bootkit capable of bypassing Windows Secure Boot protections, samples of the malware have since emerged in the wild. This is accomplished by taking advantage of a known Windows flaw called Baton Drop ( CVE-2022-21894 , CVSS score: 4.4) discovered in vulnerable&nbsp; boot loaders &nbsp;not added into the&nbsp; Secure Boot DBX revocation list . The vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft in January 2022. This loophole could be exploited by threat actors to replace fully patched boot loaders with vulnerable v

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Internet-facing Linux systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being targeted as part of a new campaign designed to illicitly mine cryptocurrency. "The threat actors behind the attack use a backdoor that deploys a wide array of tools and components such as rootkits and an IRC bot to steal device resources for mining operations," Microsoft threat intelligence researcher Rotem Sde-Or&nbsp; said . "The backdoor also installs a patched version of OpenSSH on affected devices, allowing threat actors to hijack SSH credentials, move laterally within the network, and conceal malicious SSH connections." To pull off the scheme, misconfigured Linux hosts are brute-forced to gain initial access, following which the threat actors move to disable shell history and fetch a trojanized version of OpenSSH from a remote server. The rogue OpenSSH package is configured to install and launch the backdoor, a shell script that allows the attackers to distribute additional payloads a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing campaign codenamed&nbsp; MULTI#STORM &nbsp;has set its sights on India and the U.S. by leveraging JavaScript files to deliver remote access trojans on compromised systems. "The attack chain ends with the victim machine infected with multiple unique RAT (remote access trojan) malware instances, such as Warzone RAT and Quasar RAT," Securonix researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov&nbsp; said . "Both are used for command-and-control during different stages of the infection chain." The multi-stage attack chain commences when an email recipient clicks the embedded link pointing to a password-protected ZIP file ("REQUEST.zip") hosted on Microsoft OneDrive with the password "12345." Extracting the archive file reveals a heavily obfuscated JavaScript file ("REQUEST.js") that, when double clicked, activates the infection by executing two PowerShell commands that are responsible for retrieving two separate payloads from OneDri

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Millions of software repositories on GitHub are likely vulnerable to an attack called RepoJacking , a new study has revealed. This includes repositories from organizations such as Google, Lyft, and several others, Massachusetts-based cloud-native security firm Aqua&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report. The supply chain vulnerability, also known as dependency repository hijacking, is a&nbsp; class of attacks &nbsp;that makes it possible to take over&nbsp;retired organization or user names and publish trojanized versions of repositories to run malicious code. "When a repository owner changes their username, a link is created between the old name and the new name for anyone who downloads dependencies from the old repository," researchers Ilay Goldman and Yakir Kadkoda said. "However, it is possible for anyone to create the old username and break this link." Alternatively, a similar scenario could arise when a repository ownership is transferred to another user and the original account

The Chinese cyber espionage actor known as&nbsp; Camaro Dragon &nbsp;has been observed leveraging a new strain of self-propagating malware that spreads through compromised USB drives. "While their primary focus has traditionally been Southeast Asian countries, this latest discovery reveals their global reach and highlights the alarming role USB drives play in spreading malware," Check Point said in new research shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company, which found evidence of USB malware infections in Myanmar, South Korea, Great Britain, India, and Russia, said the findings are the result of a cyber incident that it investigated at an unnamed European hospital in early 2023. The probe found that the entity was not directly targeted by the adversary but rather suffered a breach via an employee's USB drive, which became infected when it was plugged into a colleague's computer at a conference in Asia.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Why Data Exfiltration Detection is Paramount? The world is witnessing an exponential rise in ransomware and data theft employed to extort companies. At the same time, the industry faces numerous critical vulnerabilities in database software and company websites. This evolution paints a dire picture of data exposure and exfiltration that every security leader and team is grappling with. This article highlights this challenge and expounds on the benefits that Machine Learning algorithms and Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) approaches bring to the table. Data exfiltration often serves as the final act of a cyberattack, making it the last window of opportunity to detect the breach before the data is made public or is used for other sinister activities, such as espionage. However, data leakage isn't only an aftermath of cyberattacks, it can also be a consequence of human error. While prevention of data exfiltration through security controls is ideal, the escalating complexity a

A critical security flaw has been disclosed in the WordPress "Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce" plugin that's&nbsp; installed &nbsp;on more than 30,000 websites. "This vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker to gain access to the accounts of users who have abandoned their carts, who are typically customers but can extend to other high-level users when the right conditions are met," Defiant's Wordfence&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. Tracked as CVE-2023-2986, the shortcoming has been rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS scoring system. It impacts all versions of the plugin, including and prior to versions 5.14.2. The problem, at its core, is a case of authentication bypass that arises as a result of insufficient encryption protections that are applied when customers are notified when they have abandoned their shopping carts on e-commerce sites without completing the purchase. Specifically, the encryption key is hard-coded in the plugin, thereby allowing

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korean threat actor known as ScarCruft has been observed using an information-stealing malware with previous undocumented wiretapping features as well as a backdoor developed using Golang that exploits the Ably real-time messaging service. "The threat actor sent their commands through the Golang backdoor that is using the Ably service," the AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC) said in a technical report.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More details have emerged about the spyware implant that's delivered to iOS devices as part of a campaign called Operation Triangulation. Kaspersky, which&nbsp; discovered the operation &nbsp;after becoming one of the targets at the start of the year, said the malware has a lifespan of 30 days, after which it gets automatically uninstalled unless the time period is extended by the attackers. The Russian cybersecurity company has codenamed the backdoor&nbsp; TriangleDB . "The implant is deployed after the attackers obtain root privileges on the target iOS device by exploiting a kernel vulnerability," Kaspersky researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today. "It is deployed in memory, meaning that all traces of the implant are lost when the device gets rebooted. Therefore, if the victim reboots their device, the attackers have to reinfect it by sending an iMessage with a malicious attachment, thus launching the whole exploitation chain again."

Declaring your intentions There is value in making "reducing friction" an explicit goal of your security program. It sets the right tone with your counterparts across the organization, and is one step toward building a positive security culture. The first time I presented those outcomes in a company-wide forum, I received a Slack message from a senior leader who had just joined the company: "fantastic to hear about the security's teams focus on removing invisible security controls.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security shortcoming in Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) Open Authorization ( OAuth ) process could have been exploited to achieve full account takeover, researchers said. California-based identity and access management service Descope, which discovered and reported the issue in April 2023, dubbed it&nbsp; nOAuth . "nOAuth is an authentication implementation flaw that can affect Microsoft Azure AD multi-tenant OAuth applications," Omer Cohen, chief security officer at Descope,&nbsp; said . The misconfiguration has to do with how a malicious actor can modify email attributes under "Contact Information" in the Azure AD account and exploit the "Log in with Microsoft" feature to hijack a victim account. To pull off the attack, all an adversary has to do is to create and access an Azure AD admin account and modify their email address to that of a victim and take advantage of the single sign-on scheme on a vulnerable app or website.

Foreign affairs ministries in the Americas have been targeted by a Chinese state-sponsored actor named&nbsp; Flea &nbsp;as part of a recent campaign that spanned from late 2022 to early 2023. The cyber attacks, per Broadcom's Symantec, involved a new backdoor codenamed Graphican. Some of the other targets included a government finance department and a corporation that markets products in the Americas as well as one unspecified victim in an European country. "Flea used a large number of tools in this campaign," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News, describing the threat actor as "large and well-resourced." "As well as the new Graphican backdoor, the attackers leveraged a variety of living-off-the-land tools, as well as tools that have been previously linked to Flea."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware called&nbsp; Condi &nbsp;has been observed exploiting a security vulnerability in TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800) Wi-Fi routers to rope the devices into a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet. Fortinet FortiGuard Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;the campaign has ramped up since the end of May 2023. Condi is the work of a threat actor who goes by the online alias zxcr9999 on Telegram and runs a Telegram channel called Condi Network to advertise their warez. "The Telegram channel was started in May 2022, and the threat actor has been monetizing its botnet by providing DDoS-as-a-service and selling the malware source code," security researchers Joie Salvio and Roy Tay said. An analysis of the malware artifact reveals its ability to terminate other competing botnets on the same host. It, however, lacks a persistence mechanism, meaning the program cannot survive a system reboot. To get around this limitation, the malware deletes multiple binaries that are used to shut down or reboot the

Three security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in operational technology (OT) products from Wago and Schneider Electric. The flaws, per Forescout, are part of a&nbsp; broader &nbsp; set &nbsp;of&nbsp; shortcomings &nbsp;collectively called&nbsp; OT:ICEFALL , which now comprises a total of 61 issues spanning 13 different vendors. "OT:ICEFALL demonstrates the need for tighter scrutiny of, and improvements to, processes related to secure design, patching and testing in OT device vendors," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The most severe of the flaws is&nbsp; CVE-2022-46680 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), which concerns the plaintext transmission of credentials in the ION/TCP protocol used by power meters from Schneider Electric. Successful exploitation of the bug could enable threat actors to gain control of vulnerable devices.

The Quick Serve Restaurant (QSR) industry is built on consistency and shared resources. National chains like McDonald's and regional ones like Cracker Barrel grow faster by reusing the same business model, decor, and menu, with little change from one location to the next.&nbsp; QSR technology stacks mirror the consistency of the front end of each store. Despite each franchise being independently owned and operated, they share subscriptions to SaaS applications, or use multiple tenants of the same application. Each app is typically segmented by store. Corporate IT and Security has access to the entire database, while each franchise has visibility into its own data.&nbsp; These SaaS apps cover everything from CRMs to supply chains to marketing and HR. The data within is used to understand consumer habits, improve marketing campaigns, and manage employees. Like every other industry, QSR SaaS apps contain a wealth of data that needs to be secured.&nbsp; At the same time, we're seeing food cha

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A highly targeted cyber attack against an East Asian IT company involved the deployment of a custom malware written in Golang called&nbsp; RDStealer . "The operation was active for more than a year with the end goal of compromising credentials and data exfiltration," Bitdefender security researcher Victor Vrabie&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. Evidence gathered by the Romanian cybersecurity firm shows that the campaign started in early 2022. The target was an unspecified IT company located in East Asia. In the early phases, the operation relied on readily available remote access trojans like AsyncRAT and Cobalt Strike, before transitioning to bespoke malware in late 2021 or early 2022 in a bid to thwart detection. A primary evasion tactic concerns the use of Microsoft Windows folders that are likely to be excluded from scanning by security software (e.g., System32 and Program Files) to store the backdoor payloads. One of the sub-folders in question

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Individuals in the Pakistan region have been targeted using two rogue Android apps available on the Google Play Store as part of a new targeted campaign. Cybersecurity firm Cyfirma attributed the campaign with moderate confidence to a threat actor known as&nbsp; DoNot Team , which is also tracked as APT-C-35 and Viceroy Tiger. The espionage activity involves duping Android smartphone owners into downloading a program that's used to extract contact and location data from unwitting victims. "The motive behind the attack is to gather information via the stager payload and use the gathered information for the second-stage attack, using malware with more destructive features," the company&nbsp; said . DoNot Team &nbsp;is a suspected India-nexus threat actor that has a reputation for carrying out attacks against various countries in South Asia. It has been active since at least 2016.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new information-stealing malware called&nbsp; Mystic Stealer &nbsp;has been found to steal data from about 40 different web browsers and over 70 web browser extensions. First advertised on April 25, 2023, for $150 per month, the malware also targets cryptocurrency wallets, Steam, and Telegram, and employs extensive mechanisms to resist analysis. "The code is heavily obfuscated making use of polymorphic string obfuscation, hash-based import resolution, and runtime calculation of constants,"&nbsp; InQuest &nbsp;and&nbsp; Zscaler &nbsp;researchers said in an analysis published last week. Mystic Stealer, like many other crimeware solutions that are offered for sale, focuses on pilfering data and is implemented in the C programming language. The control panel has been developed using Python. Updates to the malware in May 2023 incorporate a loader component that allows it to retrieve and execute next-stage payloads fetched from a command-and-control (C2) server, making it a more formidable threat.

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a set of malicious artifacts that they say is part of a sophisticated toolkit targeting Apple macOS systems. "As of now, these samples are still largely undetected and very little information is available about any of them," Bitdefender researchers Andrei Lapusneanu and Bogdan Botezatu&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a preliminary report published on Friday. The Romanian firm's analysis is based on an examination of four samples that were uploaded to VirusTotal by an unnamed victim. The earliest sample dates back to April 18, 2023. Two of the three malicious programs are said to be generic Python-based backdoors that are designed to target Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. The payloads have been collectively dubbed&nbsp; JokerSpy . The first constituent is shared.dat, which, once launched, runs an operating system check (0 for Windows, 1 for macOS, and 2 for Linux) and establishes contact with a remote server to fetch additional instructions for execut

Microsoft Blames Massive DDoS Attack for Azure, Outlook, and OneDrive Disruptions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/microsoft-blames-massive-ddos-attack.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Friday attributed a string of service outages aimed at Azure, Outlook, and OneDrive earlier this month to an uncategorized cluster it tracks under the name&nbsp; Storm-1359 . "These attacks likely rely on access to multiple virtual private servers (VPS) in conjunction with rented cloud infrastructure, open proxies, and DDoS tools," the tech giant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post on Friday. Storm-#### (previously DEV-####) is a temporary designation the Windows maker assigns to unknown, emerging, or developing groups whose identity or affiliation hasn't been definitively established yet. While there is no evidence that any customer data was accessed or compromised, the company noted the attacks "temporarily impacted availability" of some services. Redmond said it further observed the threat actor launching&nbsp; layer 7 DDoS attacks &nbsp;from multiple cloud services and open proxy infrastructures. This includes HTTP(S) flood attacks, which bombard the target services with a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered previously undocumented payloads associated with a Romanian threat actor named&nbsp; Diicot , revealing its potential for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. "The Diicot name is significant, as it's also the name of the&nbsp; Romanian organized crime and anti-terrorism policing unit ," Cado Security&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. "In addition, artifacts from the group's campaigns contain messaging and imagery related to this organization." Diicot (née Mexals) was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Bitdefender in July 2021, uncovering the actor's use of a Go-based SSH brute-forcer tool called Diicot Brute to breach Linux hosts as part of a cryptojacking campaign. Then earlier this April, Akamai&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;what it described as a "resurgence" of the 2021 activity that's believed to have started around October 2022, netting the actor about $10,000 in illicit profits.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor known as&nbsp; ChamelGang &nbsp;has been observed using a previously undocumented implant to backdoor Linux systems, marking a new expansion of the threat actor's capabilities. The malware, dubbed&nbsp; ChamelDoH &nbsp;by Stairwell, is a C++-based tool for communicating via DNS-over-HTTPS ( DoH ) tunneling. ChamelGang was&nbsp; first outed &nbsp;by Russian cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies in September 2021, detailing its attacks on fuel, energy, and aviation production industries in Russia, the U.S., India, Nepal, Taiwan, and Japan. Attack chains mounted by the actor have leveraged vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application to gain initial access and carry out data theft attacks using a passive backdoor called DoorMe. "This is a native&nbsp; IIS module &nbsp;that is registered as a filter through which HTTP requests and responses are processed," Positive Technologies said at the time.

As Threat Actors Continuously Adapt their TTPs in Today's Threat Landscape, So Must You Earlier this year, threat researchers at Cybersixgill released the annual report,&nbsp; The State of the Cybercrime Underground . &nbsp;The research stems from an analysis of Cybersixgill's collected intelligence items throughout 2022, gathered from the deep, dark and clear web. The report examines the continuous evolution of threat actors' tactics, tools, and procedures (TTPs) in the Digital Age – and how organizations can adapt to reduce risk and maintain business resilience. This article summarizes a few of the report's findings, including trends in credit card fraud, observations about cryptocurrency, AI developments and how they're lowering barriers to entry to cybercrime, and the rise of cybercriminal "as-a-service" activities.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Thursday unveiled charges against a Russian national for his alleged involvement in deploying LockBit ransomware to targets in the U.S., Asia, Europe, and Africa. Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov, 20, of Chechen Republic has been accused of perpetrating at least five attacks between August 2020 and March 2023. He was arrested in the state of Arizona last month. "Astamirov allegedly participated in a conspiracy with other members of the LockBit ransomware campaign to commit wire fraud and to intentionally damage protected computers and make ransom demands through the use and deployment of ransomware," the DoJ&nbsp; said . Astamirov, as part of his LockBit-related activities, managed various email addresses, IP addresses, and other online accounts to deploy the ransomware and communicate with the victims.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Progress Software on Thursday&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a third vulnerability impacting its MOVEit Transfer application, as the Cl0p cybercrime gang deployed extortion tactics against affected companies. The&nbsp; new flaw , which is being tracked as CVE-2023-35708 , also concerns an SQL injection vulnerability that "could lead to escalated privileges and potential unauthorized access to the environment." The company is urging its customers to disable all HTTP and HTTPs traffic to MOVEit Transfer on ports 80 and 443 to safeguard their environments while a fix is being prepared to address the weakness. The cloud managed file transfer solution has been fully patched. The revelation comes a week after Progress&nbsp; divulged &nbsp;another set of SQL injection vulnerabilities ( CVE-2023-35036 ) that it said could be weaponized to access the application's database content. The vulnerabilities join&nbsp; CVE-2023-34362 , which was&nbsp; exploited &nbsp;as a zero-day by the Clop ransomware gang in data theft attacks

Kroll Suffers Data Breach: Employee Falls Victim to SIM Swapping Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/kroll-suffers-data-breach-employee.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Risk and financial advisory solutions provider Kroll on Friday disclosed that one of its employees fell victim to a "highly sophisticated" SIM swapping attack. The incident, which took place on August 19, 2023, targeted the employee's T-Mobile account, the company said. "Specifically, T-Mobile, without any authority from or contact with Kroll or its employee, transferred that employee's phone number to the threat actor's phone at their request," it&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. This enabled the unidentified actor to gain access to certain files containing personal information of bankruptcy claimants in the matters of BlockFi , FTX , and Genesis. SIM swapping (aka SIM splitting or simjacking), while generally a benign process, could be exploited by threat actors to fraudulently activate a SIM card under their control with a victim's phone number. This makes it possible to intercept SMS messages and voice calls and receive MFA-related messages that cont

Nearly 2,000 Citrix NetScaler instances have been compromised with a backdoor by weaponizing a recently disclosed critical security vulnerability as part of a large-scale attack. "An adversary appears to have exploited CVE-2023-3519 in an automated fashion, placing web shells on vulnerable NetScalers to gain persistent access," NCC Group&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory released Tuesday. "The adversary can execute arbitrary commands with this webshell, even when a NetScaler is patched and/or rebooted." CVE-2023-3519 refers to a critical code injection vulnerability impacting NetScaler ADC and Gateway servers that could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. It was patched by Citrix last month. The development comes a week after the Shadowserver Foundation&nbsp; said &nbsp;it identified close to 7,000 vulnerable, unpatched NetScaler ADC and Gateway instances online and the flaw is being abused to drop PHP web shells on vulnerable servers for remote access.

The U.K. Electoral Commission on Tuesday disclosed a "complex" cyber attack on its systems that went undetected for over a year, allowing the threat actors to access years worth of voter data belonging to 40 million people. "The incident was identified in October 2022 after suspicious activity was detected on our systems," the regulator&nbsp; said . "It became clear that hostile actors had first accessed the systems in August 2021." The intrusion enabled unauthorized access to the Commission's servers hosting email, control systems, and copies of the electoral registers it maintains for research purposes. The identity of the intruders are presently unknown. The registers included the name and address of anyone in the U.K. who registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, as well as the names of those registered as overseas voters. However, they did not contain information of those who qualified to register anonymously and addresses of overseas electors regi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The defense sector in Ukraine and Eastern Europe has been targeted by a novel .NET-based backdoor called&nbsp; DeliveryCheck &nbsp;(aka CAPIBAR or GAMEDAY) that's capable of delivering next-stage payloads. The Microsoft threat intelligence team, in&nbsp; collaboration &nbsp;with the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA), attributed the attacks to a Russian nation-state actor known as&nbsp; Turla , which is also tracked under the names Iron Hunter, Secret Blizzard (formerly Krypton), Uroburos, Venomous Bear, and Waterbug. It's linked to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB). "DeliveryCheck is distributed via email as documents with malicious macros," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets. "It persists via a scheduled task that downloads and launches it in memory. It also contacts a C2 server to retrieve tasks, which can include the launch of arbitrary payloads embedded in XSLT stylesheets." Successful initial access is also accompanied in some cases by t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A little over a week after&nbsp; JumpCloud reset API keys of customers &nbsp;impacted by a security incident, the company said the intrusion was the work of a sophisticated nation-state actor. The adversary "gained unauthorized access to our systems to target a small and specific set of our customers," Bob Phan, chief information security officer (CISO) at JumpCloud,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post-mortem report. "The attack vector used by the threat actor has been mitigated." The U.S. enterprise software firm said it identified anomalous activity on June 27, 2023, on an internal orchestration system, which it traced back to a spear-phishing campaign mounted by the attacker on June 22. While JumpCloud said it took security steps to shield its network by rotating credentials and rebuilding its systems, it wasn't until July 5 when it detected "unusual activity" in the commands framework for a small set of customers, prompting a forced-rotation of all admin API keys.

Microsoft on Friday said a validation error in its source code allowed for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tokens to be forged by a malicious actor known as&nbsp; Storm-0558 &nbsp;using a Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key to breach two dozen organizations. "Storm-0558 acquired an inactive MSA consumer signing key and used it to forge authentication tokens for Azure AD enterprise and MSA consumer to access OWA and Outlook.com," the tech giant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deeper analysis of the campaign. "The method by which the actor acquired the key is a matter of ongoing investigation." "Though the key was intended only for MSA accounts, a validation issue allowed this key to be trusted for signing Azure AD tokens. This issue has been corrected." It's not immediately clear if the token validation issue was exploited as a "zero-day vulnerability" or if Microsoft was already aware of the problem before it came under in-the-wild abuse.

An unnamed Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agency in the U.S. detected anomalous email activity in mid-June 2023, leading to Microsoft's discovery of a new China-linked&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;targeting two dozen organizations. The details come from a joint cybersecurity advisory released by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on July 12, 2023.

Password Reset Hack Exposed in Honda's E-Commerce Platform, Dealers Data at Risk<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/password-reset-hack-exposed-in-hondas-e.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security vulnerabilities discovered in Honda's e-commerce platform could have been exploited to gain unrestricted access to sensitive dealer information. "Broken/missing access controls made it possible to access all data on the platform, even when logged in as a test account," security researcher Eaton Zveare&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. The&nbsp; platform &nbsp;is designed for the sale of power equipment, marine, lawn and garden businesses. It does not impact the Japanese company's automobile division. The hack, in a nutshell, exploits a password reset mechanism on one of Honda's sites, Power Equipment Tech Express (PETE), to reset the password associated with any account and obtain full admin-level access.

New PowerExchange Backdoor Used in Iranian Cyber Attack on UAE Government<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/new-powerexchange-backdoor-used-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unnamed government entity associated with the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) was targeted by a likely Iranian threat actor to breach the victim's Microsoft Exchange Server with a "simple yet effective" backdoor dubbed&nbsp; PowerExchange . According to a new report from Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, the intrusion relied on email phishing as an initial access pathway, leading to the execution of a .NET executable contained with a ZIP file attachment. The binary, which masquerades as a PDF document, functions as a dropper to execute the final payload, which then launches the backdoor. PowerExchange, written in PowerShell, employs text files attached to emails for command-and-control (C2) communication. It allows the threat actor to run arbitrary payloads and upload and download files from and to the system. The custom implant achieves this by making use of the Exchange Web Services ( EWS ) API to connect to the victim's Exchange Server and uses a mailbox on the server to

The state-sponsored actor is&nbsp; geared &nbsp;towards espionage and information gathering, with the cluster active since June 2021 and obscuring its intrusion footprint by taking advantage of tools already installed or built into infected machines. Some of the prominent sectors targeted include communications, manufacturing, utility, transportation, construction, maritime, government, information technology, and education.

The threat actors behind the ransomware attack on Taiwanese PC maker MSI last month have leaked the company's private code signing keys on their dark website. "Confirmed, Intel OEM private key leaked, causing an impact on the entire ecosystem," Alex Matrosov, founder and CEO of firmware security firm Binarly,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a tweet over the weekend. "It appears that Intel Boot Guard may not be effective on certain devices based on the 11th Tiger Lake, 12th Adler Lake, and 13th Raptor Lake." Present in the leaked data are firmware image signing keys associated with 57 PCs and private signing keys for Intel Boot Guard used on 116 MSI products. The Boot Guard keys from MSI are believed to impact several device vendors, including Intel, Lenovo and Supermicro. Intel Boot Guard is a&nbsp; hardware-based security technology &nbsp;that's designed to protect computers against executing tampered UEFI firmware.

OpenAI Reveals Redis Bug Behind ChatGPT User Data Exposure Incident<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/openai-reveals-redis-bug-behind-chatgpt.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
OpenAI on Friday disclosed that a bug in the Redis open source library was responsible for the exposure of other users' personal information and chat titles in the upstart's ChatGPT service earlier this week. The&nbsp; glitch , which came to light on March 20, 2023, enabled certain users to view brief descriptions of other users' conversations from the chat history sidebar, prompting the company to temporarily shut down the chatbot. "It's also possible that the first message of a newly-created conversation was visible in someone else's chat history if both users were active around the same time," the company&nbsp; said . The bug, it further added, originated in the&nbsp; redis-py library , leading to a scenario where canceled requests could cause connections to be corrupted and return unexpected data from the database cache, in this case, information belonging to an unrelated user. To make matters worse, the San Francisco-based AI research company said it introduce

Operation Soft Cell: Chinese Hackers Breach Middle East Telecom Providers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/operation-soft-cell-chinese-hackers.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Telecommunication providers in the Middle East are the subject of new cyber attacks that commenced in the first quarter of 2023. The intrusion set has been attributed to a Chinese cyber espionage actor associated with a long-running campaign dubbed&nbsp; Operation Soft Cell &nbsp;based on tooling overlaps. "The initial attack phase involves infiltrating Internet-facing Microsoft Exchange servers to deploy web shells used for command execution," researchers from SentinelOne and QGroup said in a&nbsp; new technical report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News. "Once a foothold is established, the attackers conduct a variety of reconnaissance, credential theft, lateral movement, and data exfiltration activities." Operation Soft Cell, according to&nbsp; Cybereason , refers to malicious activities undertaken by China-affiliated actors targeting telecommunications providers since at least 2012. The Soft Cell threat actor, also tracked by Microsoft as&nbsp; Gallium , is known to target unpatched int

Mispadu Banking Trojan Targets Latin America: 90,000+ Credentials Stolen<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/mispadu-banking-trojan-targets-latin.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A banking trojan dubbed&nbsp; Mispadu &nbsp;has been linked to multiple spam campaigns targeting countries like Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Portugal with the goal of stealing credentials and delivering other payloads. The activity, which commenced in August 2022, is currently ongoing, Ocelot Team from Latin American cybersecurity firm Metabase Q said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Mispadu &nbsp;(aka URSA) was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by ESET in November 2019, describing its ability to perpetrate monetary and credential theft and act as a backdoor by taking screenshots and capturing keystrokes. "One of their main strategies is to compromise legitimate websites, searching for vulnerable versions of WordPress, to turn them into their command-and-control server to spread malware from there, filtering out countries they do not wish to infect, dropping different type of malware based on the country being infected," researchers Fernando García and Dan Regalado said.

2022 was the year when inflation hit world economies, except in one corner of the global marketplace – stolen data. Ransomware payments fell by over 40% in 2022 compared to 2021. More organisations chose not to pay ransom demands, according to findings by blockchain firm Chainalysis. Nonetheless, stolen data has value beyond a price tag, and in risky ways you may not expect. Evaluating stolen records is what&nbsp; Lab 1, a new cyber monitoring platform , believes will make a big difference for long-term cybersecurity resilience. Think of data value this way:&nbsp; Stolen credentials can become future phishing attacks Logins for adult websites are potential extortion attempts Travel and location data are a risk to VIPs and senior leadership, And so on… Hackers could retaliate for non-payment by simply posting their loot to forums where the data will be available for further enrichment and exploitation.&nbsp; Shining a light on dark places Even though your company may not have suffered a di

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Golang-based malware dubbed&nbsp; GoBruteforcer &nbsp;has been found targeting web servers running phpMyAdmin, MySQL, FTP, and Postgres to corral the devices into a botnet. "GoBruteforcer chose a Classless Inter-Domain Routing ( CIDR ) block for scanning the network during the attack, and it targeted all IP addresses within that CIDR range," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers&nbsp; said . "The threat actor chose CIDR block scanning as a way to get access to a wide range of target hosts on different IPs within a network instead of using a single IP address as a target." The malware is mainly designed to single out Unix-like platforms running x86, x64 and ARM architectures, with GoBruteforcer attempting to obtain access via a brute-force attack using a list of credentials hard-coded into the binary. If the attack proves to be successful, an internet relay chat ( IRC ) bot is deployed on the victim server to establish communications with an actor-controlled server.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The massive breach at LastPass was the result of one of its engineers failing to update Plex on their home computer, in what's a sobering reminder of the dangers of failing to keep software up-to-date. The embattled password management service last week&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;how unidentified actors leveraged information stolen from an earlier incident that took place prior to August 12, 2022, along with details "available from a third-party data breach and a vulnerability in a third-party media software package to launch a coordinated second attack" between August and October 2022. The intrusion ultimately enabled the adversary to steal partially encrypted password vault data and customer information. The second attack specifically singled out one of the four DevOps engineers, targeting their home computer with a keylogger malware to obtain the credentials and breach the cloud storage environment. This, in turn, is said to have been made possible by exploiting a nearly three-y

LastPass, which in December 2022 disclosed a severe data breach that allowed threat actors to access encrypted password vaults, said it happened as a result of the same adversary launching a second attack on its systems. The company said one of its DevOps engineers had their personal home computer breached and infected with a keylogger as part of a sustained cyber attack that exfiltrated sensitive data from its Amazon AWS cloud storage servers. "The threat actor leveraged information stolen during the first incident, information available from a third-party data breach, and a vulnerability in a third-party media software package to launch a coordinated second attack," the password management service&nbsp; said . This intrusion targeted the company's infrastructure, resources, and one of its employees from August 12, 2022 to October 26, 2022. The original incident, on the other hand, ended on August 12, 2022.

Popular cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase disclosed that it experienced a cybersecurity attack that targeted its employees. The company&nbsp; said &nbsp;its "cyber controls prevented the attacker from gaining direct system access and prevented any loss of funds or compromise of customer information." The incident, which took place on February 5, 2023, resulted in the exposure of a "limited amount of data" from its directory, including employee names, e-mail addresses, and some phone numbers. As part of the attack, several employees were targeted in an SMS phishing campaign urging them to sign in to their company accounts to read an important message. One employee is said to have fallen for the scam, who entered their username and password in a fake login page set up by the threat actors to harvest the credentials.

GoDaddy Discloses Multi-Year Security Breach Causing Malware Installations and Source Code Theft<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/godaddy-discloses-multi-year-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Web hosting services provider GoDaddy on Friday disclosed a multi-year security breach that enabled unknown threat actors to install malware and siphon source code related to some of its services. The company attributed the campaign to a "sophisticated and organized group targeting hosting services." GoDaddy said in December 2022, it received an unspecified number of customer complaints about their websites getting sporadically redirected to malicious sites, which it later found was due to the unauthorized third party gaining access to servers hosted in its&nbsp; cPanel environment . The threat actor "installed malware causing the intermittent redirection of customer websites," the company&nbsp; said . The ultimate objective of the intrusions, GoDaddy said, is to "infect websites and servers with malware for phishing campaigns, malware distribution, and other malicious activities."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind the black hat redirect malware campaign have scaled up their campaign to use more than 70 bogus domains mimicking URL shorteners and infected over&nbsp;10,800 websites. "The main objective is still ad fraud by artificially increasing traffic to pages which contain the AdSense ID which contain Google ads for revenue generation," Sucuri researcher Ben Martin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. Details of the malicious activity were&nbsp; first exposed &nbsp;by the GoDaddy-owned company in November 2022. The campaign, which is said to have been active since September last year, is orchestrated to redirect visitors to compromised WordPress sites to fake Q&amp;A portals. The goal, it appears, is to increase the authority of spammy sites in search engine results. "It's possible that these bad actors are simply trying to convince Google that real people from different IPs using different browsers are clicking on their search results," Sucuri noted a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Popular social news aggregation platform Reddit has disclosed that it was the victim of a security incident that enabled unidentified threat actors to gain unauthorized access to internal documents, code, and some unspecified business systems. The company blamed it on a "sophisticated and highly-targeted phishing attack" that took place on February 5, 2023, aimed at its employees. The attack entailed sending out "plausible-sounding prompts" that redirected to a website masquerading as Reddit's intranet portal in an attempt to steal credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens. A single employee's credentials is said to have been phished in this manner, enabling the threat actor to access Reddit's internal systems. The affected employee self-reported the hack, it further added. The company, however, stressed that there is no evidence to suggest that its production systems were breached or that users' non-public data had been compromise

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
At least 1,200 Redis database servers worldwide have been corralled into a botnet using an "elusive and severe threat" dubbed HeadCrab since early September 2021. "This advanced threat actor utilizes a state-of-the-art, custom-made malware that is undetectable by agentless and traditional anti-virus solutions to compromise a large number of Redis servers," Aqua security researcher Asaf Eitani&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report. A significant concentration of infections has been recorded in China, Malaysia, India, Germany, the U.K., and the U.S. to date. The origins of the threat actor are presently unknown. The findings come two months after the cloud security firm shed light on a Go-based malware codenamed&nbsp; Redigo &nbsp;that has been found compromising Redis servers. The attack is designed to target Redis servers that are exposed to the internet, followed by issuing a&nbsp; SLAVEOF command &nbsp;from another Redis server that's already under the adversary's control.

GitHub Breach: Hackers Stole Code-Signing Certificates for GitHub Desktop and Atom<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/github-breach-hackers-stole-code.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
GitHub on Monday disclosed that unknown threat actors managed to exfiltrate encrypted code signing certificates pertaining to some versions of GitHub Desktop for Mac and Atom apps. As a result, the company is&nbsp; taking the step &nbsp;of revoking the exposed certificates out of abundance of caution. The following versions of GitHub Desktop for Mac have been invalidated: 3.0.2, 3.0.3, 3.0.4, 3.0.5, 3.0.6, 3.0.7, 3.0.8, 3.1.0, 3.1.1, and 3.1.2. Versions 1.63.0 and 1.63.1 of 1.63.0 of Atom are also expected to stop working as of February 2, 2023, requiring that users downgrade to a&nbsp; previous version &nbsp;(1.60.0) of the source code editor. Atom was officially discontinued in December 2022. GitHub Desktop for Windows is not affected. The Microsoft-owned subsidiary said it detected unauthorized access to a set of repositories, including those from deprecated GitHub-owned organizations, used in the planning and development of GitHub Desktop and Atom on December 7, 2022.

U.S. Federal Agencies Fall Victim to Cyber Attack Utilizing Legitimate RMM Software<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/us-federal-agencies-fall-victim-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
At least two federal agencies in the U.S. fell victim to a "widespread cyber campaign" that involved the use of legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software to perpetuate a phishing scam. "Specifically, cyber criminal actors sent phishing emails that led to the download of legitimate RMM software – ScreenConnect (now ConnectWise Control) and AnyDesk – which the actors used in a refund scam to steal money from victim bank accounts," U.S. cybersecurity authorities&nbsp; said . The joint advisory comes from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). The attacks, which took place in mid-June and mid-September 2022, have financial motivations, although threat actors could weaponize the unauthorized access for conducting a wide range of activities, including selling that access to other hacking crews. Usage of remote software by criminal grou

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A massive campaign has infected over 4,500 WordPress websites as part of a long-running operation that's been believed to be active since at least 2017. According to GoDaddy-owned Sucuri, the infections involve the injection of obfuscated JavaScript hosted on a malicious domain named "track[.]violetlovelines[.]com" that's designed to redirect visitors to unwanted sites. The latest&nbsp; operation &nbsp;is said to have been active since December 26, 2022, according to&nbsp; data &nbsp;from urlscan.io. A prior wave seen in&nbsp; early December 2022 &nbsp;impacted more than 3,600 sites, while another set of attacks recorded in&nbsp; September 2022 &nbsp;ensnared more than 7,000 sites. The rogue code is inserted in the WordPress index.php file, with Sucuri noting that it has removed such changes from more than 33,000 files on the compromised sites in the past 60 days.

LastPass-owner GoTo (formerly LogMeIn) on Tuesday disclosed that unidentified threat actors were able to steal encrypted backups of some customers' data along with an encryption key for some of those backups in a November 2022 incident. The breach, which targeted a third-party cloud storage service, impacted Central, Pro, join.me, Hamachi, and RemotelyAnywhere products, the company said. "The affected information, which varies by product, may include account usernames, salted and hashed passwords, a portion of multi-factor Authentication (MFA) settings, as well as some product settings and licensing information," GoTo's Paddy Srinivasan&nbsp; said . Additionally, MFA settings pertaining to a subset of its Rescue and GoToMyPC customers were impacted, although there is no evidence that the encrypted databases associated with the two services were exfiltrated.

A recent IcedID malware attack enabled the threat actor to compromise the Active Directory domain of an unnamed target less than 24 hours after gaining initial access. "Throughout the attack, the attacker followed a routine of recon commands, credential theft, lateral movement by abusing Windows protocols, and executing Cobalt Strike on the newly compromised host," Cybereason researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. IcedID , also known by the name BokBot, started its life as a banking trojan in 2017 before evolving into a&nbsp; dropper for other malware , joining the likes of&nbsp; Emotet ,&nbsp; TrickBot ,&nbsp; Qakbot ,&nbsp; Bumblebee , and&nbsp; Raspberry Robin . Attacks involving the delivery of IcedID have&nbsp; leveraged a variety of methods , especially in the wake of&nbsp; Microsoft's decision to block macros &nbsp;from Office files downloaded from the web.

Twitter on Wednesday said that its investigation found "no evidence" that users' data sold online was obtained by exploiting any security vulnerabilities in its systems. "Based on information and intel analyzed to investigate the issue, there is no evidence that the data being sold online was obtained by exploiting a vulnerability of Twitter systems," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. "The data is likely a collection of data already publicly available online through different sources." The disclosure comes in the wake of&nbsp; multiple &nbsp; reports &nbsp;that Twitter data belonging to millions of users – 5.4 million in November 2022, 400 million in December 2022, and 200 million last week – have been made available for sale on online criminal forums.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud services provider Rackspace on Thursday confirmed that the ransomware gang known as Play was responsible for last month's breach. The security incident, which took place on December 2, 2022, leveraged a previously unknown security exploit to gain initial access to the Rackspace Hosted Exchange email environment. "This zero-day exploit is associated with&nbsp; CVE-2022-41080 ," the Texas-based company&nbsp; said . "Microsoft disclosed CVE-2022-41080 as a privilege escalation vulnerability and did not include notes for being part of a remote code execution chain that was exploitable." Rackspace's forensic investigation found that the threat actor accessed the Personal Storage Table ( .PST ) of 27 customers out of a total of nearly 30,000 customers on the Hosted Exchange email environment. However, the company said there is no evidence the adversary viewed, misused, or distributed the customer's emails or data from those personal storage folders. It furt

And the personal data stolen, in itself, is not sufficient to enable identity and financial fraud. The raw data we have analyzed today so far is incomplete and hard to understand."   The leak comes almost a month after the company acknowledged that personal data belonging to&nbsp; around 9.7 million &nbsp;of its current and former customers were accessed following a ransomware incident in October 2022.  This includes 5.1 million Medibank customers, 2.8 million ahm customers, and 1.8 million international cust

LastPass Suffers Another Security Breach; Exposed Some Customers Information<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/12/lastpass-suffers-another-security.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Popular password management service LastPass said it's investigating a second security incident that involved attackers accessing some of its customer information.  "We recently detected unusual activity within a third-party cloud storage service, which is currently shared by both LastPass and its affiliate, GoTo," LastPass CEO Karim Toubba&nbsp; said .  GoTo, formerly called LogMeIn, acquired LastPass in October 2015. In December 2021, the Boston-based firm&nbsp; announced &nbsp;plans to spin off LastPass as an independent company.  The digital break-in resulted in the unauthorized third-party leveraging information obtained following a previous breach in August 2022 to access "certain elements of our customers' information."   The August 2022 security event&nbsp; targeted &nbsp;its development environment, leading to the theft of some of its source code and technical information. In September, LastPass&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;the threat actor had access for four days.  The scope of the breach

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Iranian government-sponsored threat actors have been blamed for compromising a U.S. federal agency by taking advantage of the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server.  The details, which were shared by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), come in response to incident response efforts undertaken by the authority from mid-June through mid-July 2022.  "Cyber threat actors exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server, installed XMRig crypto mining software, moved laterally to the domain controller (DC), compromised credentials, and then implanted Ngrok reverse proxies on several hosts to maintain persistence," CISA&nbsp; noted .  LogShell, aka&nbsp; CVE-2021-44228 , is a critical remote code execution flaw in the widely-used Apache Log4j Java-based logging library. It was addressed by the open source project maintainers in December 2021.   The latest development&nbsp; marks &nbsp;the&nbsp; continued &nbsp; abuse &nbsp;of the Log4j v

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Hundreds of databases on Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) are exposing personal identifiable information (PII), new findings from Mitiga, a cloud incident response company, show.  "Leaking PII in this manner provides a potential treasure trove for threat actors – either during the reconnaissance phase of the cyber kill chain or extortionware/ransomware campaigns," researchers Ariel Szarf, Doron Karmi, and Lionel Saposnik said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.  This includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, marital status, car rental information, and even company logins.   Amazon RDS is a&nbsp; web service &nbsp;that makes it possible to set up relational databases in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It offers support for different database engines such as MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

Researchers Say China State-backed Hackers Breached a Digital Certificate Authority<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/researchers-say-china-state-backed.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected Chinese state-sponsored actor breached a digital certificate authority as well as government and defense agencies located in different countries in Asia as part of an ongoing campaign since at least March 2022.  Symantec, by Broadcom Software, linked the attacks to an adversarial group it tracks under the name&nbsp; Billbug , citing the use of tools previously attributed to this actor. The activity appears to be driven by espionage and data-theft, although no data is said to have been stolen to date.  Billbug , also called Bronze Elgin, Lotus Blossom, Lotus Panda,&nbsp; Spring Dragon , and&nbsp; Thrip , is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that is believed to operate on behalf of Chinese interests. Primary targets include government and military organizations in South East Asia.   Attacks mounted by the adversary in 2019 involved the use of backdoors like&nbsp; Hannotog and Sagerunex , with the intrusions observed in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.

Over 15,000 WordPress Sites Compromised in Malicious SEO Campaign<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/over-15000-wordpress-sites-compromised.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malicious campaign has compromised&nbsp; over 15,000 WordPress websites &nbsp;in an attempt to redirect visitors to bogus Q&amp;A portals.  "These malicious redirects appear to be designed to increase the authority of the attacker's sites for search engines," Sucuri researcher Ben Martin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week, calling it a "clever black hat SEO trick."  The search engine poisoning technique is designed to promote a "handful of fake low quality Q&amp;A sites" that share similar website-building templates and are operated by the same threat actor.   A notable aspect of the campaign is the ability of the hackers to modify over 100 files per website on average, an approach that contrasts dramatically from other attacks of this kind wherein only a limited number of files are tampered with to reduce footprint and escape detection.  Some of the most commonly infected pages consist of wp-signup.php, wp-cron.php, wp-links-opml.php, wp-settings.php

Australian health insurer Medibank today confirmed that personal data belonging to around 9.7 million of its current and former customers were accessed following a ransomware incident.  The&nbsp; attack , according to the company, was detected in its IT network on October 12 in a manner that it said was "consistent with the precursors to a ransomware event," prompting it to isolate its systems, but not before the attackers exfiltrated the data.  "This figure represents around 5.1 million Medibank customers, around 2.8 million ahm customers, and around 1.8 million international customers," Medibank&nbsp; noted .   Compromised details include names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses, as well as Medicare numbers (but not expiry dates) for ahm customers, and passport numbers (but not expiry dates) and visa details for international student customers.

Security researchers are warning of "a trove of sensitive information" leaking through&nbsp;urlscan.io, a website scanner for suspicious and malicious URLs.

File hosting service Dropbox on Tuesday disclosed that it was the victim of a phishing campaign that allowed unidentified threat actors to gain unauthorized access to 130 of its source code repositories on GitHub.

It, however, stressed that the repositories did not contain source code related to its core apps or infrastructure.

Microsoft this week confirmed that it inadvertently exposed information related to thousands of customers following a security lapse that left an endpoint publicly accessible over the internet sans any authentication.  "This misconfiguration resulted in the potential for unauthenticated access to some business transaction data corresponding to interactions between Microsoft and prospective customers, such as the planning or potential implementation and provisioning of Microsoft services," Microsoft&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert.  Microsoft also emphasized that the B2B leak was "caused by an unintentional misconfiguration on an endpoint that is not in use across the Microsoft ecosystem and was not the result of a security vulnerability."  The misconfiguration of the Azure Blob Storage was spotted on September 24, 2022, by cybersecurity company SOCRadar, which termed the leak&nbsp; BlueBleed .

Chipmaker Intel has confirmed that proprietary source code related to its Alder Lake CPUs has been leaked, following its release by an unknown third-party on 4chan and GitHub last week.  The published content contains Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) code for&nbsp; Alder Lake , the company's 12th generation processors that was originally launched in November 2021.  In a statement shared with Tom's Hardware, Intel&nbsp; said &nbsp;the leak doesn't expose "any new security vulnerabilities as we do not rely on obfuscation of information as a security measure."   It's also encouraging the broader security research community to report any potential issues through its&nbsp; bug bounty program , adding it's reaching out to customers to notify them of the matter.  Besides the UEFI code, the leaked data dump includes a plethora of files and tools, some of which appear to come from firmware vendor Insyde Software.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Australia's largest telecommunications company Telstra disclosed that it was the victim of a data breach through a third-party, nearly two weeks after Optus reported a breach of its own.  "There has been no breach of Telstra's systems," Narelle Devine, the company's chief information security officer for the Asia Pacific region,&nbsp; said . "And no customer account data was involved."   It said the breach targeted a third-party platform called&nbsp; Work Life NAB &nbsp;that's no longer actively used by the company, and that the leaked data posted on the internet concerned a "now-obsolete Telstra employee rewards program."   Telstra also noted it became aware of the breach last week, adding the information included first and last names and the email addresses used to sign up for the program. It further clarified that the data posted was from 2017.  The data was "basic in nature," Devine said.&nbsp;   The company did not reveal how many employees wer

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) on Monday disclosed it's working to gather "crucial evidence" and that it's collaborating with overseas law enforcement authorities following the hack of telecom provider Optus.

It claimed it "immediately shut down the attack" as soon as it came to light.   The threat actor behind the breach also briefly released a sample of 10,200 records from the breach – putting those users at heightened risk of fraud – in addition to asking for $1 million as part of an extortion demand.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Uber on Monday disclosed more details related to the&nbsp; security incident &nbsp;that happened last week, pinning the attack on a threat actor it believes is affiliated to the notorious LAPSUS$ hacking group.  "This group typically uses similar techniques to target technology companies, and in 2022 alone has breached Microsoft, Cisco, Samsung, NVIDIA, and Okta, among others," the San Francisco-based company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an update.  The financially-motivated extortionist gang was dealt a huge blow in March 2022 when the City of London Police&nbsp; moved to arrest &nbsp;seven suspected LAPSUS$ gang members aged between 16 and 21. Weeks later, two of them were charged for their actions.  The hacker behind the Uber breach, an 18-year-old teenager who goes by the moniker Tea Pot, has also claimed responsibility for breaking into video game maker&nbsp; Rockstar Games &nbsp;over the weekend.   Uber said it's working with "several leading digital forensics firms" as the company's investigation i

American video game publisher Rockstar Games  on Monday revealed it was a victim of a "network intrusion" that allowed an unauthorized party to illegally download early footage for the Grand Theft Auto VI.

Uber, in an update, said there is "no evidence" that users' private information was compromised in a breach of its internal computer systems that was discovered late Thursday.

The ride-hailing company also said it's brought back online all the internal software tools it took down previously as a precaution, reiterating it's notified law enforcement of the matter.  It's not immediately clear if the incident resulted in the theft of any other information or how long the intruder was inside Uber's network.

Ride hailing giant Uber&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;Thursday it's responding to a cybersecurity incident involving a breach of its network and that it's in touch with law enforcement authorities.

The hack is said to have forced the company to take its internal communications and engineering systems offline as it investigated the extent of the breach.  The publication said the malicious intruder compromised an employee's Slack account, and leveraged it to broadcast a message that the company had "suffered a data breach," in addition to listing internal databases that's supposed to have been compromised.  "It appeared that the hacker was later able to gain access to other internal systems, posting an explicit photo on an internal information page for employees," the New York Times said.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hacktivist collective called&nbsp; GhostSec &nbsp;has claimed credit for compromising as many as 55 Berghof programmable logic controllers ( PLCs ) used by Israeli organizations as part of a "Free Palestine" campaign.  Industrial cybersecurity firm OTORIO, which&nbsp; dug deeper &nbsp;into the incident, said the breach was made possible owing to the fact that the PLCs were accessible through the Internet and were secured by trivially guessable credentials.  Details of the compromise first came to light on September 4 after GhostSec shared a video on its Telegram channel demonstrating a successful login to the PLC's admin panel, in addition to dumping data from the hacked controllers.  The Israeli company said the system dumps and screenshots were exported directly from the admin panel following unauthorized access to the controllers through their public IP addresses.

A recent report revealed that ecommerce provider,&nbsp; Shopify uses particularly weak password policies &nbsp;on the customer-facing portion of its Website. According to the report, Shopify's requires its customers to use a password that is at least five characters in length and that does not begin or end with a space.&nbsp;  According to the report, Specops researchers analyzed a list of a billion passwords that were known to have been breached and found that 99.7% of those passwords adhere to Shopify's requirements. While this is not meant to suggest that Shopify customers' passwords have been breached, the fact that so many known breached passwords adhere to Shopify's minimum password requirements does underscore the dangers associated with using weak passwords.

South Korean chaebol Samsung on Friday said it experienced a cybersecurity incident that resulted in the unauthorized access of some customer information, the second time this year it has reported such a breach.  "In late July 2022, an unauthorized third-party acquired information from some of Samsung's U.S. systems," the company&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a notice. "On or around August 4, 2022, we determined through our ongoing investigation that personal information of certain customers was affected."   Samsung said the infiltration enabled hackers to access certain data such as names, contact and demographic information, dates of birth, and product registration details.  It stressed that the incident did not affect users' Social Security numbers or credit and debit card numbers, but noted the information leaked for each relevant customer may vary.

Over 1,800 Android and iOS Apps Found Leaking Hard-Coded AWS Credentials<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/over-1800-android-and-ios-apps-found.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have identified 1,859 apps across Android and iOS containing hard-coded Amazon Web Services (AWS) credentials, posing a major security risk.  "Over three-quarters (77%) of the apps contained valid AWS access tokens allowing access to private AWS cloud services," Symantec's Threat Hunter team, a part of Broadcom Software, said in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News.  Interestingly, a little more than 50% of the apps were found using the same AWS tokens found in other apps maintained by other developers and companies, indicating a supply chain vulnerability.   "The AWS access tokens could be traced to a shared library, third-party SDK, or other shared component used in developing the apps," the researchers said.  These credentials are typically used for downloading appropriate resources necessary for the app's functions as well as accessing configuration files and authenticating to other cloud services.  To make matters worse, 47% of the identi

Twilio, which earlier this month became a&nbsp; sophisticated phishing attack , disclosed last week that the threat actors also managed to gain access to the accounts of 93 individual users of its Authy two-factor authentication (2FA) service.  The communication tools company&nbsp; said &nbsp;the unauthorized access made it possible for the adversary to register additional devices to those accounts. It has since identified and removed the illegitimately added devices from the impacted accounts.  Authy, acquired by Twilio in February 2015, allows&nbsp; safeguarding online accounts &nbsp;with a second security layer to prevent account takeover attacks. It's estimated to have nearly 75 million users.  Twilio further noted its investigation as of August 24, 2022, turned up 163 affected customers, up from 125 it reported on August 10, whose accounts it said were hacked for a limited period of time.

Popular end-to-end encrypted messaging service Signal on Monday disclosed the cyberattack aimed at Twilio earlier this month may have exposed the phone numbers of roughly 1,900 users.  "For about 1,900 users, an attacker could have attempted to re-register their number to another device or learned that their number was registered to Signal," the company&nbsp; said . "All users can rest assured that their message history, contact lists, profile information, whom they'd blocked, and other personal data remain private and secure and were not affected."  Signal, which uses Twilio to send SMS verification codes to users registering with the app, said it's in the process of alerting the affected users directly and prompting them to re-register the service on their devices.   The development comes less than a week after Twilio&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that data associated with about 125 customer accounts were accessed by malicious actors through a phishing attack that duped the comp

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Web infrastructure company Cloudflare on Tuesday disclosed at least 76 employees and their family members received text messages on their personal and work phones bearing similar characteristics as that of the sophisticated&nbsp; phishing attack against Twilio .  The attack, which transpired around the same time Twilio was targeted, came from four phone numbers associated with T-Mobile-issued SIM cards and was ultimately unsuccessful.  The text messages pointed to a seemingly legitimate domain containing the keywords "Cloudflare" and "Okta" in an attempt to deceive the employees into handing over their credentials.   The wave of over 100 smishing messages commenced less than 40 minutes after the rogue domain was registered via Porkbun, the company noted, adding the phishing page was designed to relay the credentials entered by unsuspecting users to the attacker via Telegram in real-time.   This also meant that the attack could defeat 2FA roadblocks, as the Time-based On

"The attackers then used the stolen credentials to gain access to some of our internal systems, where they were able to access certain customer data."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Twitter on Friday revealed that a now-patched zero-day bug was used to link phone numbers and emails to user accounts on the social media platform.  "As a result of the vulnerability, if someone submitted an email address or phone number to Twitter's systems, Twitter's systems would tell the person what Twitter account the submitted email addresses or phone number was associated with, if any," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory.   Twitter said the bug, which it was&nbsp; made aware &nbsp;of in January 2022, stemmed from a code change introduced in June 2021. No passwords were exposed as a result of the incident.  The six-month delay in making this public stems from new evidence last month that an unidentified actor had potentially taken advantage of the flaw before the fix to scrape user information and sell it for profit on&nbsp; Breach Forums .  Although Twitter didn't reveal the exact number of impacted users, the forum post made by the threat actor shows that the flaw was ex

Slack Resets Passwords After a Bug Exposed Hashed Passwords for Some Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/slack-resets-passwords-after-bug.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Slack said it took the step of resetting passwords for about 0.5% of its users after a flaw exposed salted password hashes when creating or revoking shared invitation links for workspaces.  "When a user performed either of these actions, Slack transmitted a hashed version of their password to other workspace members," the enterprise communication and collaboration platform&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert on 4th August.   Hashing refers to a cryptographic technique that transforms any form of data into a fixed-size output (called a hash value or simply hash).&nbsp; Salting &nbsp;is designed to add an extra security layer to the hashing process to make it resistant to brute-force attempts.  The Salesforce-owned company, which reported more than&nbsp; 12 million daily active users &nbsp;in September 2019, didn't reveal the exact&nbsp; hashing algorithm &nbsp;used to safeguard the passwords.  The bug is said to have impacted all users who created or revoked shared invitation links between 17 April 2017 and 17 July 20

Researchers have uncovered a list of 3,207 apps, some of which can be utilized to gain unauthorized access to Twitter accounts.  The takeover is made possible, thanks to a leak of legitimate Consumer Key and Consumer Secret information, respectively, Singapore-based cybersecurity firm CloudSEK said in a report  exclusively shared with The Hacker News.  "Out of 3,207, 230 apps are leaking all four authentication credentials and can be used to fully take over their Twitter Accounts and can perform any critical/sensitive actions," the researchers said.&nbsp;   This can range from reading direct messages to carrying out arbitrary actions such as retweeting, liking and deleting tweets, following any account, removing followers, accessing account settings, and even changing the account profile picture.  Access to the Twitter API&nbsp; requires &nbsp;generating the Keys and Access Tokens, which act as the usernames and passwords for the apps as well as the users on whose behalf the API requests w

Network credentials and virtual private network (VPN) access for colleges and universities based in the U.S. are being advertised for sale on underground and public criminal marketplaces.  "This exposure of sensitive credential and network access information, especially privileged user accounts, could lead to subsequent cyber attacks against individual users or affiliated organizations," the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published last week.   The cyber intrusions against educational institutions involve threat actors leveraging tactics like spear-phishing and ransomware to carry out credential harvesting activities. The gathered credentials are then exfiltrated and sold on Russian cybercrime forums for prices ranging from a few to thousands of U.S. dollars.  Armed with this login information, the agency pointed out, adversaries can proceed to conduct brute-force&nbsp; credential stuffing &nbsp;attacks to break into victim accounts spanning different

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two trojanized Python and PHP packages have been uncovered in what's yet another instance of a software supply chain attack targeting the open source ecosystem.  One of the packages in question is "ctx," a Python module available in the PyPi repository. The other involves "phpass," a PHP package that's been forked on GitHub to distribute a rogue update.  "In both cases the attacker appears to have taken over packages that have not been updated in a while," the SANS Internet Storm Center (ISC)&nbsp; said , one of whose volunteer incident handlers, Yee Ching, analyzed the ctx package.  It's worth noting that ctx was last published to PyPi on December 19, 2014. On the other hand, phpass hasn't received an update since it was uploaded to Packagist on August 31, 2012.  The malicious Python package, which was pushed to PyPi on May 21, 2022, has been&nbsp; removed from the repository , but the PHP library still continues to be&nbsp; available &nbsp;on GitHub.   In b

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a massive campaign that's responsible for injecting malicious JavaScript code into compromised WordPress websites that redirects visitors to scam pages and other malicious websites to generate illegitimate traffic.  "The websites all shared a common issue — malicious JavaScript had been injected within their website's files and the database, including legitimate core WordPress files," Krasimir Konov, a malware analyst at Sucuri,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Wednesday.   This involved infecting files such as jquery.min.js and jquery-migrate.min.js with obfuscated JavaScript that's activated on every page load, allowing the attacker to redirect the website visitors to a destination of their choice.  The GoDaddy-owned website security company said that the domains at the end of the redirect chain could be used to load advertisements, phishing pages, malware, or even trigger another set of redirects.

Heroku Forces User Password Resets Following GitHub OAuth Token Theft<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/heroku-forces-user-password-resets.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Salesforce-owned subsidiary Heroku on Thursday acknowledged that the theft of GitHub integration OAuth tokens further involved unauthorized access to an internal customer database.  The company, in an&nbsp; updated notification , revealed that a compromised token was abused to breach the database and "exfiltrate the hashed and salted passwords for customers' user accounts."  As a consequence, Salesforce said it's resetting all Heroku user passwords and ensuring that potentially affected credentials are refreshed. It also emphasized that internal Heroku credentials were rotated and extra detections have been put in place.   The attack campaign, which GitHub&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;on April 12, related to an unidentified actor leveraging stolen OAuth user tokens issued to two third-party OAuth integrators, Heroku and Travis-CI, to download data from dozens of organizations, including NPM.  The timeline of events as shared by the cloud platform is as follows -   April 7, 2022 &nbsp;- Threat

An ElasticSearch server instance that was left open on the Internet without a password contained sensitive financial information about loans from Indian and African financial services.  The leak, which was discovered by researchers from information security company UpGuard, amounted to 5.8GB and consisted of a total of 1,686,363 records.  "Those records included personal information like name, loan amount, date of birth, account number, and more," UpGuard&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "A total of 48,043 unique email addresses were in the collection, some of which were for the product administrators, corporate clients, and collection agents assigned to each case."   The exposed instance, used as data storage for a&nbsp; debt collection platform &nbsp;called ENCollect, was detected on February 16, 2022.

Okta Says Security Breach by Lapsus$ Hackers Impacted Only Two of Its Customers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/okta-says-security-breach-by-lapsus.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Identity and access management provider Okta on Tuesday said it concluded its probe into the&nbsp; breach &nbsp;of a third-party vendor in late January 2022 by the LAPSUS$ extortionist gang.  Stating that the "impact of the incident was significantly less than the maximum potential impact" the company had previously shared last month, Okta&nbsp; said &nbsp;the intrusion impacted only two customer tenants, down from 366 as was initially assumed.   The&nbsp; security event &nbsp;took place on January 21 when the LAPSUS$ hacking group gained unauthorized remote access to a workstation belonging to a Sitel support engineer. But it only became public knowledge nearly two months later when the adversary&nbsp; posted &nbsp;screenshots of Okta's internal systems on their Telegram channel.  In addition to accessing two active customer tenants within the SuperUser application — which is used to perform basic management functions — the hacker group is said to have viewed limited additional information in other applicatio

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
GitHub on Monday noted that it had notified all victims of an attack campaign, which involved an unauthorized party downloading private repository contents by taking advantage of third-party OAuth user tokens maintained by Heroku and Travis CI.  "Customers should also continue to monitor Heroku and Travis CI for updates on their own investigations into the affected OAuth applications," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an updated post.  The&nbsp; incident &nbsp;originally came to light on April 12 when GitHub uncovered signs that a malicious actor had leveraged the stolen OAuth user tokens issued to Heroku and Travis-CI to download data from dozens of organizations, including NPM.   The Microsoft-owned platform also said that it will alert customers promptly should the ongoing investigation identify additional victims. Additionally, it cautioned that the adversary may also be digging into the repositories for secrets that could be used in other attacks.  Heroku, which has pulled support for GitHu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud-based repository hosting service GitHub on Friday revealed that it discovered evidence of an unnamed adversary capitalizing on stolen OAuth user tokens to unauthorizedly download private data from several organizations.  "An attacker abused stolen OAuth user tokens issued to two third-party OAuth integrators, Heroku and Travis-CI, to download data from dozens of organizations, including NPM," GitHub's Mike Hanley&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a report.   OAuth access tokens are often&nbsp; used &nbsp;by apps and services to authorize access to specific parts of a user's data and communicate with each other without having to share the actual credentials. It's one of the most common methods used to pass authorization from a single sign-on ( SSO ) service to another application.  As of April 15, 2022, the list of affected OAuth applications is as follows -   Heroku Dashboard (ID: 145909)  Heroku Dashboard (ID: 628778)  Heroku Dashboard – Preview (ID: 313468)  Heroku Dashboard – Classi

Traffic direction systems are used by threat actors to determine whether or not a target is of interest and should be redirected to a malicious domain under their control and act as a gateway to compromise their systems with malware.   Earlier this January, the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team detailed another TDS called&nbsp; Prometheus &nbsp;that has been put to use in different campaigns mounted by cybercriminal groups to distribute Campo Loader, Hancitor, IcedID, QBot, Buer Loader, and SocGholish malware.

The LAPSUS$ data extortion gang announced their return on Telegram after a week-long "vacation," leaking what they claim is data from software services company Globant.  "We are officially back from a vacation," the group wrote on their Telegram channel – which has nearly around 54,000 members as of writing – posting images of extracted data and credentials belonging to the company's DevOps infrastructure.   The screenshots depict a folder listing for what appears to be different companies from across the world, including Arcserve, Banco Galicia, BNP Paribas Cardif, Citibanamex, DHL, Facebook, Stifel, among others.  Also shared is a torrent file purported to contain around 70GB of Globant's source code as well as administrator passwords associated with the firm's Atlassian suite, including Confluence and Jira, and the Crucible code review tool.

Microsoft on Tuesday&nbsp; confirmed &nbsp;that the LAPSUS$ extortion-focused hacking crew had gained "limited access" to its systems, as authentication services provider Okta revealed that nearly 2.5% of its customers have been potentially impacted in the wake of the breach.  "No customer code or data was involved in the observed activities," Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said, adding that the breach was facilitated by means of a single compromised account that has since been remediated to prevent further malicious activity.  The Windows maker, which was already tracking the group under the moniker DEV-0537 prior to the public disclosure,&nbsp; said &nbsp;it "does not rely on the secrecy of code as a security measure and viewing source code does not lead to elevation of risk."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
American chipmaking company NVIDIA on Tuesday confirmed that its network was breached as a result of a cyber attack, enabling the perpetrators to gain access to sensitive data, including source code purportedly associated with its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology.  "We have no evidence of ransomware being deployed on the NVIDIA environment or that this is related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a security notice. "However, we are aware that the threat actor took employee passwords and some NVIDIA proprietary information from our systems and has begun leaking it online."  The incident is said to have come to light on February 23, with the company noting that it's taken steps to analyze the leaked information and that it's enforcing all of its employees to change their passwords with immediate effect.   The confirmation comes days after&nbsp; The Telegraph &nbsp;last week reported that the company is investigating a potential cyber

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Days after the Conti ransomware group broadcasted a pro-Russian message pledging its allegiance to Vladimir Putin's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, a disgruntled member of the cartel has leaked the syndicate's internal chats.  The file dump, published by malware research group&nbsp; VX-Underground , is said to contain 13 months of chat logs between affiliates and administrators of the Russia-affiliated ransomware group from January 2021 to February 2022, in a move that's expected to offer&nbsp; unprecedented &nbsp; insight &nbsp;into the gang's workings.  "Glory to Ukraine," the leaker said in their message.  The leaked conversations show that Conti used fake front companies to attempt to schedule product demos with security firms like CarbonBlack and Sophos to obtain code signing certificates, with the operators working in scrum sprints to complete the software development tasks.   Additionally, the messages&nbsp; confirm &nbsp;the&nbsp; shutdown of the TrickBot botnet &nbsp;last week as well as high

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security flaw has been unearthed in Microsoft's Azure App Service that resulted in the exposure of source code of customer applications written in Java, Node, PHP, Python, and Ruby for at least four years since September 2017.  The vulnerability, codenamed " NotLegit ," was reported to the tech giant by Wiz researchers on October 7, 2021, following which mitigations have been undertaken to fix the information disclosure bug in November. Microsoft&nbsp; said &nbsp;a "limited&nbsp;subset of customers" are at risk, adding "Customers who deployed code to App Service Linux via Local Git after files were already created in the application were the only impacted customers."   The&nbsp; Azure App Service &nbsp;(aka Azure Web Apps) is a cloud computing-based platform for building and hosting web applications. It allows users to deploy source code and artifacts to the service using a local&nbsp; Git &nbsp;repository, or via repositories hosted on GitHub and Bitbucket.   The insecure default be

Web hosting giant GoDaddy on Monday disclosed a data breach that resulted in the unauthorized access of data belonging to a total of 1.2 million active and inactive customers, making it the&nbsp; third &nbsp; security incident &nbsp;to come to light since 2018.  In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the world's largest domain registrar&nbsp; said &nbsp;that a malicious third-party managed to gain access to its&nbsp; Managed WordPress &nbsp;hosting environment on September 6 with the help of a compromised password, using it to obtain sensitive information pertaining to its customers. It's not immediately clear if the compromised password was secured with two-factor authentication.   The Arizona-based company&nbsp; claims &nbsp;over 20 million customers, with more than 82 million domain names registered using its services.   GoDaddy revealed it discovered the break-in on November 17. An investigation into the incident is ongoing and the company said it's "contacting all impacted custo

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Saturday confirmed unidentified threat actors have breached one of its email servers to blast hoax messages about a fake "sophisticated chain attack."  The incident, which was first&nbsp; publicly disclosed &nbsp;by threat intelligence non-profit SpamHaus, involved sending rogue warning emails with the subject line "Urgent: Threat actor in systems" originating from a legitimate FBI email address "eims@ic.fbi[.]gov" that framed the attack on Vinny Troia, a security researcher and founder of dark web intelligence firms Night Lion Security and Shadowbyte, while also claiming him to be affiliated with a hacking outfit named TheDarkOverlord.   SpamHaus cited its own telemetry data to point out that the email blasts happened over two "spam" waves, one shortly before 5:00 a.m. UTC and another one shortly after 7:00 a.m. UTC.&nbsp;  However, according to Kryptos Logic researcher Marcus Hutchins, the goal appears to be

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Friday&nbsp; warned &nbsp;of crypto-mining malware embedded in " UAParser.js ," a popular JavaScript NPM library with over 6 million weekly downloads, days after the NPM repository moved to get rid of three rogue packages that were found to mimic the same library.   The supply-chain attack targeting the open-source library saw three different versions — 0.7.29, 0.8.0, 1.0.0 — that were published with malicious code on Thursday following a successful takeover of the maintainer's NPM account.  "I believe someone was hijacking my NPM account and published some compromised packages (0.7.29, 0.8.0, 1.0.0) which will probably install malware," UAParser.js's developer Faisal Salman&nbsp; said . The issue has been patched in versions 0.7.30, 0.8.1, and 1.0.1.   The development comes days after DevSecOps firm Sonatype disclosed details of three packages —&nbsp; okhsa, klow, and klown &nbsp;— that masqueraded as the user-agent stri

Known to be active as far back as 2016, LightBasin (aka UNC1945) is believed to have compromised 13 telecommunication companies across the world since 2019 by leveraging custom tools and their extensive knowledge of telecommunications protocols for scything through organizations' defenses.

Microsoft Exchange Bug Exposes ~100,000 Windows Domain Credentials<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/microsoft-exchange-bug-exposes-100000.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unpatched design flaw in the implementation of Microsoft Exchange's Autodiscover protocol has resulted in the leak of approximately 100,000 login names and passwords for Windows domains worldwide.  "This is a severe security issue, since if an attacker can control such domains or has the ability to 'sniff' traffic in the same network, they can capture domain credentials in plain text (HTTP basic authentication) that are being transferred over the wire," Guardicore's Amit Serper&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report.  "Moreover, if the attacker has DNS-poisoning capabilities on a large scale (such as a nation-state attacker), they could systematically syphon out leaky passwords through a large-scale DNS poisoning campaign based on these Autodiscover TLDs [top-level domains]."   The Exchange&nbsp; Autodiscover &nbsp;service enables users to configure applications such as Microsoft Outlook with minimal user input, allowing just a combination of email addresses and pas

Colombian Real Estate Agency Leak Exposes Records of Over 100,000 Buyers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/colombian-real-estate-agency-leak.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More than one terabyte of data containing 5.5 million files has been left exposed, leaking personal information of over 100,000 customers of a Colombian real estate firm, according to cybersecurity company WizCase.  The breach was discovered by Ata Hakçıl and his team in a database owned by Coninsa Ramon  H, a company that specializes in architecture, engineering, construction, and real estate services. "There was no need for a password or login credentials to see this information, and the data was not encrypted," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an exclusive report shared with The Hacker News.   The data exposure is the result of a misconfigured Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket, causing sensitive information such as clients' names, photos, and addresses to be disclosed. The details stored in the bucket range from invoices and income documents to quotes and account statements dating between 2014 and 2021. The complete list of information contained in

In yet another instance of software supply chain attack, unidentified hackers breached the website of&nbsp; MonPass , one of Mongolia's major certificate authorities, to backdoor its installer software with Cobalt Strike binaries.  The trojanized client was available for download between February 8, 2021, and March 3, 2021, said Czech cybersecurity software company Avast in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;published Thursday.  In addition, a public webserver hosted by MonPass was infiltrated potentially as many as eight separate times, with the researchers uncovering eight different web shells and backdoors on the compromised server.   Avast's investigation into the incident began after it discovered the backdoored installer and the implant on one of its customers' systems.

The ransomware cartel that masterminded the&nbsp; Colonial Pipeline attack &nbsp;early last month crippled the pipeline operator's network using a compromised virtual private network (VPN) account password, the latest investigation into the incident has revealed.  The development, which was&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by Bloomberg on Friday, involved gaining an initial foothold into the networks as early as April 29 through the VPN account, which allowed employees to access the company's networks remotely.  The VPN login was unused but active at the time of the attack, the report said, adding the password has since been discovered inside a batch of leaked passwords on the dark web, suggesting that an employee of the company may have reused the same password on another account that was previously breached.  It's, however, unclear how the password was obtained, Charles Carmakal, senior vice president at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, was quoted as saying to the publication. The FireEye-owned subsidi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
India's flag carrier airline, Air India, has&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a data breach affecting 4.5 million of its customers over a period stretching nearly 10 years after its Passenger Service System (PSS) provider SITA fell victim to a cyber attack earlier this year.  The breach involves personal data registered between Aug. 26, 2011 and Feb. 3, 2021, including details such as names, dates of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance, and Air India frequent flyer data as well as credit card data. But Air India said neither CVV/CVC numbers associated with the credit cards nor passwords were affected.   The airline had previously&nbsp; acknowledged &nbsp;the breach on March 19, stating that "its Passenger Service System provider has informed about a sophisticated cyber attack it was subjected to in the last week of February 2021."  In March, Swiss aviation information technology company SITA&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;it suffered a "highly sophisticated attack&amp;quo

23 Android Apps Expose Over 100,000,000 Users' Personal Data<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/these-23-android-apps-expose-over.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Misconfigurations in multiple Android apps leaked sensitive data of more than 100 million users, potentially making them a lucrative target for malicious actors.  "By not following best-practices when configuring and integrating third-party cloud-services into applications, millions of users' private data was exposed," Check Point researchers said in an analysis published today and shared with The Hacker News.  "In some cases, this type of misuse only affects the users, however, the developers were also left vulnerable. The misconfigurations put users' personal data and developer's internal resources, such as access to update mechanisms, storage, and more at risk."  The findings come from a study of 23 Android applications available in the official Google Play Store, some of which have downloads ranging from 10,000 to 10 million, such as Astro Guru , iFax, Logo Maker , Screen Recorder , and T'Leva .   According to Check Point, the issues stem from m

"These repositories contained some internal credentials, which have all been rotated, and alert-related data for a subset of our MDR customers."   On April 15, software auditing startup Codecov alerted customers that its Bash Uploader utility had been infected with a backdoor as early as January 31 by unknown parties to gain access to authentication tokens for various internal software accounts used by developers.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Most mobile app users tend to blindly trust that the apps they download from app stores are safe and secure. But that isn't always the case.  To demonstrate the pitfalls and identify vulnerabilities on a large scale, cybersecurity and machine intelligence company CloudSEK recently provided a platform called&nbsp; BeVigil &nbsp;where individuals can search and check app security ratings and other security issues before installing an app.  A latest&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News detailed how the BeVigil search engine identified over 40 apps - with more than a cumulative 100 million downloads - that had hardcoded private Amazon Web Services (AWS) keys embedded within them, putting their internal networks and their users' data at risk of cyberattacks.  BeVigil finds popular apps leaking AWS keys  The AWS key leakage was spotted in some of the major apps such as Adobe Photoshop Fix, Adobe Comp, Hootsuite, IBM's Weather Channel, and online shopping services Club Factory and Wholee.

3.2 Billion Leaked Passwords Contain 1.5 Million Records with Government Emails<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/32-billion-leaked-passwords-contain-15.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A staggering number of 3.28 billion passwords linked to 2.18 billion unique email addresses were exposed in what's one of the largest data dumps of breached usernames and passwords.  In addition, the leak includes 1,502,909 passwords associated with email addresses from government domains across the world, with the U.S. government alone taking up 625,505 of the exposed passwords, followed by the U.K (205,099), Australia (136,025), Brazil (68,535), and Canada (50,726).  The findings come from an analysis of a massive 100GB data set called "COMB21" — aka Compilation of Many Breaches — that was published for free in an online cybercrime forum earlier this February by putting together data from multiple leaks in different companies and organizations that occurred over the years.   It's worth noting that a leak doesn't imply a breach of public administration systems. The passwords are said to have been obtained via techniques such as password hash cracking after being

Click Studios, the Australian software company behind the Passwordstate  password management application, has notified customers to reset their passwords following a supply chain attack.  The Adelaide-based firm said a bad actor used sophisticated techniques to compromise the software's update mechanism and used it to drop malware on user computers.  The breach is said to have occurred between April 20, 8:33 PM UTC, and April 22, 0:30 AM UTC, for a total period of about 28 hours.  "Only customers that performed In-Place Upgrades between the times stated above are believed to be affected," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "Manual Upgrades of Passwordstate are not compromised. Affected customers password records may have been harvested."   The development was first reported by the Polish tech news site&nbsp; Niebezpiecznik . It's not immediately clear who the attackers are or how they compromised the password manager's update feature.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing malvertising campaign tracked as "Tag Barnakle" has been behind the breach of more than 120 ad servers over the past year to sneakily inject code in an attempt to serve malicious advertisements that redirect users to rogue websites, thus exposing victims to scamware or malware.  Unlike other operators who set about their task by infiltrating the ad-tech ecosystem using "convincing personas" to buy space on legitimate websites for running the malicious ads, Tag Barnakle is "able to bypass this initial hurdle completely by going straight for the jugular — mass compromise of ad serving infrastructure,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Confiant security researcher Eliya Stein in a Monday write-up.   The development follows a year after the Tag Barnakle actor was found to have&nbsp; compromised nearly 60 ad servers &nbsp;in April 2020, with the infections primarily targeting an open-source advertising server called Revive.  The latest slew of attacks is no different, although the adve

The maintainers of the PHP programming language have issued an update regarding the security incident that came to light late last month, stating that the actors may have gotten hold of a user database containing their passwords to make unauthorized changes to the repository.  "We no longer believe the git.php.net server has been compromised. However, it is possible that the master.php.net user database leaked," Nikita Popov&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a message posted on its mailing list on April 6.   On March 28, unidentified actors used the names of Rasmus Lerdorf and Popov to&nbsp; push malicious commits &nbsp;to the "php-src" repository hosted on the git.php.net server that involved adding a backdoor to the PHP source code in an instance of a software supply chain attack.

In what's likely to be a goldmine for bad actors, personal information associated with approximately 533 million Facebook users worldwide has been leaked on a popular cybercrime forum for free—which was harvested by hackers in 2019 using a Facebook vulnerability.  The&nbsp; leaked data &nbsp;includes full names, Facebook IDs, mobile numbers, locations, email addresses, gender, occupation, city, country, marital status broken, account creation date, and other profile details down by country, with over 32 million records belonging to users in the U.S., 11 million users the U.K., and six million users in India, among others.   In total, the data being offered includes user information from 106 countries.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Popular Indian mobile payments service MobiKwik  on Monday came under fire after 8.2 terabytes (TB) of data belonging to millions of its users began circulating on the dark web in the aftermath of a major data breach that came to light earlier this month.  The leaked data includes sensitive personal information such as: customer names, hashed passwords, email addresses, residential addresses, GPS locations, list of installed apps, partially-masked credit card numbers, connected bank accounts and associated account numbers, and know your customer (KYC) documents of 3.5 million users.  Even worse, the leak also shows that MobiKwik does not&nbsp; delete the card information &nbsp;from its servers even after a user has removed them, in what's likely a breach of government regulations.  New guidelines issued by India's apex banking institution, the Reserve Bank of India,&nbsp; prohibit &nbsp;online merchants, e-commerce websites, and payment aggregators from storing card details of a customer online.

The changes are said to have been made yesterday on March 28.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The European Banking Authority (EBA) on Sunday said it had been a victim of a cyberattack targeting its Microsoft Exchange Servers, forcing it to&nbsp;temporarily take its email systems offline as a precautionary measure.

Enterprise cloud security firm Qualys  has become the latest victim to join a long list of entities to have suffered a data breach after zero-day vulnerabilities in its Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) server were exploited to steal sensitive business documents.

Confirming the incident, Qualys Chief Information Security Officer Ben Carr&nbsp; said &nbsp;a detailed probe "identified unauthorized access to files hosted on the Accellion FTA server" located in a DMZ (aka&nbsp; demilitarized zone ) environment that's segregated from the rest of the internal network.

The massive state-sponsored&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;that compromised software maker SolarWinds also targeted Microsoft, as the unfolding investigation into the hacking spree reveals the incident may have been far more wider in scope, sophistication, and impact than previously thought.  News of Microsoft's compromise was first reported by Reuters , which also said the company's own products were then used to strike other victims by leveraging its cloud offerings, citing people familiar with the matter.  The Windows maker, however, denied the threat actor had infiltrated its production systems to stage further attacks against its customers.  In a statement to The Hacker News via email, the company said —  "Like other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of this actor and can confirm that we detected malicious SolarWinds binaries in our environment, which we isolated and removed.

Cybersecurity researchers today disclosed a new supply-chain attack targeting the Vietnam Government Certification Authority (VGCA) that compromised the agency's digital signature toolkit to install a backdoor on victim systems.  Uncovered by Slovak internet security company ESET  early this month, the "SignSight" attack involved modifying software installers hosted on the CA's&nbsp; website &nbsp;("ca.gov.vn") to insert a spyware tool called&nbsp; PhantomNet &nbsp;or Smanager.  According to ESET's telemetry, the breach happened from at least July 23 to August 16, 2020, with the&nbsp; two installers &nbsp;in question — "gca01-client-v2-x32-8.3.msi" and "gca01-client-v2-x64-8.3.msi" for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems — tampered to include the backdoor.   After the attack was reported to VGCA, the certificate authority confirmed that "they were aware of the attack before our notification and that they notified the users who downloaded the trojanized softwar

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The investigation into how the attackers managed to compromise SolarWinds' internal network and poison the company's software updates are still underway, but we may one step close to understanding what appears to be a very meticulously planned and highly-sophisticated supply chain attack.  A new report  published by ReversingLabs today and shared in advance with The Hacker News has revealed that the operators behind the&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;likely managed to compromise the software build and code signing infrastructure of SolarWinds Orion platform as early as October 2019 to deliver the malicious backdoor through its software release process.  "The source code of the affected library was directly modified to include malicious backdoor code, which was compiled, signed, and delivered through the existing software patch release management system," ReversingLabs' Tomislav Pericin said.   Cybersecurity firm FireEye earlier this week&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;how multiple SolarWinds

SolarWinds, the enterprise monitoring software provider who found itself at the epicenter of the most&nbsp; consequential supply chain attacks , said as many as 18,000 of its high-profile customers might have installed a tainted version of its Orion products.  The acknowledgment comes as part of a new filing made by the company to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.  The Texas-based company serves more than 300,000 customers worldwide, including every branch of the US military and four-fifths of the Fortune 500 companies.  The "incident was likely the result of a highly sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by an outside nation state," SolarWinds said in the&nbsp; regulatory disclosure , adding it "currently believes the actual number of customers that may have had an installation of the Orion products that contained this vulnerability to be fewer than 18,000."
