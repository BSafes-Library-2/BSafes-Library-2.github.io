<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
American video game publisher Rockstar Games  on Monday revealed it was a victim of a "network intrusion" that allowed an unauthorized party to illegally download early footage for the Grand Theft Auto VI.  "At this time, we do not anticipate any disruption to our live game services nor any long-term effect on the development of our ongoing projects," the company  said  in a notice shared on its social media handles.   The company said that the third-party accessed "confidential information from our systems," although it's not immediately clear if it involved any other data beyond the game footage.  The trove of data, contains some 90 videos of clips from the game, leaked over the weekend on  GTAForums  by a user with an alias "teapotuberhacker," hinting that the party is also the same person responsible for the  recent Uber breach .   The Uber hacker, who is going by the name  Tea Pot , is believed to be an 18-year-old teenager. No other de

Emotet Botnet Started Distributing Quantum and BlackCat Ransomware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/emotet-botnet-started-distributing.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Emotet malware is now being leveraged by ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups, including Quantum and BlackCat, after  Conti's official retirement  from the threat landscape this year.  Emotet  started off as a banking trojan in 2014, but updates added to it over time have transformed the malware into a highly potent threat that's capable of downloading other payloads onto the victim's machine, which would allow the attacker to control it remotely.  Although the infrastructure associated with the invasive malware loader was taken down as part of a law enforcement effort in January 2021, the Conti ransomware cartel is said to have  played an instrumental role  in its comeback late last year.   "From November 2021 to Conti's dissolution in June 2022, Emotet was an exclusive Conti ransomware tool, however, the Emotet infection chain is currently attributed to Quantum and BlackCat," AdvIntel  said  in an advisory published last week.

Organizations and security teams work to protect themselves from any vulnerability, and often don't realize that risk is also brought on by configurations in their SaaS apps that have not been hardened. The newly published GIFShell attack method, which occurs through Microsoft Teams, is a perfect example of how threat actors can exploit legitimate features and configurations that haven't been correctly set. This article takes a look at what the method entails and the steps needed to combat it.   The GifShell Attack Method  Discovered by Bobby Rauch , the GIFShell attack technique enables bad actors to exploit several Microsoft Teams features to act as a C&C for malware, and exfiltrate data using GIFs without being detected by EDR and other network monitoring tools. This attack method requires a device or user that is already compromised.   Learn how an SSPM can assess, monitor and remediate SaaS misconfigurations and Device-to-SaaS user risk .

A decryptor for the LockerGoga ransomware has been  made available  by Romanian cybersecurity firm Bitdefender in collaboration with Europol, the No More Ransom project, and Zürich law enforcement authorities.  Identified in January 2019, LockerGoga drew headlines for its attacks against the Norwegian aluminum giant  Norsk Hydro . It's said to have infected more than 1,800 victims in 71 countries, causing an estimated $104 million in damages.   The ransomware operation received a significant blow in October 2021 when 12 people in connection with the group, alongside MegaCortex and Dharma, were apprehended as part of an  international law enforcement effort .   The arrests, which took place in Ukraine and Switzerland, also saw the seizure of cash worth $52,000, five luxury vehicles, and a number of electronic devices. One of the accused is currently in pretrial detention in Zurich.  The Zurich Cantonal Police further said it spent the past months examining the data storage devices

Microsoft said it's tracking an ongoing large-scale click fraud campaign targeting gamers by means of stealthily deployed browser extensions on compromised systems.  "[The] attackers monetize clicks generated by a browser node-webkit or malicious browser extension secretly installed on devices," Microsoft Security Intelligence said  in a sequence of tweets over the weekend.  The tech giant's cybersecurity division is tracking the developing threat cluster under the name DEV-0796.   Attach chains mounted by the adversary commence with an ISO file that's downloaded onto a victim's machine upon clicking on a malicious ad or comments on YouTube. The ISO file, when opened, is designed to install a browser node-webkit (aka  NW.js ) or rogue browser extension.   It's worth noting that the  ISO file  masquerades as hacks and cheats for the Krunker first-person shooter game. Cheats are programs that help gamers gain an added advantage beyond the available capabili

Uber, in an update, said there is "no evidence" that users' private information was compromised in a breach of its internal computer systems that was discovered late Thursday.  "We have no evidence that the incident involved access to sensitive user data (like trip history)," the company  said . "All of our services including Uber, Uber Eats, Uber Freight, and the Uber Driver app are operational."  The ride-hailing company also said it's brought back online all the internal software tools it took down previously as a precaution, reiterating it's notified law enforcement of the matter.  It's not immediately clear if the incident resulted in the theft of any other information or how long the intruder was inside Uber's network.  Uber has not provided more specifics of how the incident played out beyond saying its investigation and response efforts are ongoing. But independent security researcher Bill Demirkapi characterized Uber's &qu

The company, which said it completed the probe into the hack in partnership with incident response firm Mandiant, said the access was achieved using a developer's compromised endpoint.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have exposed new connections between a widely used pay-per-install (PPI) malware service known as PrivateLoader and another PPI platform offered by a cybercriminal actor dubbed ruzki.  "The threat actor ruzki (aka les0k, zhigalsz) advertises their PPI service on underground Russian-speaking forums and their Telegram channels under the name ruzki or zhigalsz since at least May 2021," SEKOIA  said.  The cybersecurity firm said its investigations into the twin services led it to conclude that PrivateLoader is the proprietary loader of the ruzki PPI malware service.  PrivateLoader, as the name implies, functions as a C++-based loader to download and deploy additional malicious payloads on infected Windows hosts. It's primarily distributed through SEO-optimized websites that claim to provide cracked software.  Although it was  first documented  earlier this February by Intel471, it's said to have been put to use starting as early as May 2021.   S

North Korean Hackers Spreading Trojanized Versions of PuTTY Client Application<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/north-korean-hackers-spreading.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat with a North Korea nexus has been found leveraging a "novel spear phish methodology" that involves making use of trojanized versions of the PuTTY SSH and Telnet client.  Google-owned threat intelligence firm Mandiant attributed the new campaign to an emerging threat cluster it tracks under the name  UNC4034 .  "UNC4034 established communication with the victim over WhatsApp and lured them to download a malicious ISO package regarding a fake job offering that led to the deployment of the AIRDRY.V2 backdoor through a trojanized instance of the PuTTY utility," Mandiant researchers  said .   The utilization of fabricated job lures as a pathway for malware distribution is an oft-used tactic by North Korean state-sponsored actors, including the Lazarus Group, as part of an enduring campaign called  Operation Dream Job .  The entry point of the attack is an ISO file that masquerades as an Amazon Assessment as part of a potential job opportunity at the tech giant.

Malicious actors such as Kinsing are taking advantage of both recently disclosed and older security flaws in Oracle WebLogic Server to deliver cryptocurrency-mining malware.  Cybersecurity company Trend Micro said it  found  the financially-motivated group leveraging the vulnerability to drop Python scripts with capabilities to disable operating system (OS) security features such as Security-Enhanced Linux ( SELinux ), and others.  The operators behind the  Kinsing malware  have a history of scanning for vulnerable servers to co-opt them into a botnet, including that of  Redis ,  SaltStack ,  Log4Shell ,  Spring4Shell , and the Atlassian Confluence flaw ( CVE-2022-26134 ).   The Kinsing actors have also been involved in campaigns against container environments via  misconfigured open Docker Daemon API ports  to launch a crypto miner and subsequently spread the malware to other containers and hosts.  The latest wave of attacks entails the actor weaponizing  CVE-2020-14882  (CVSS score:

Ride hailing giant Uber  disclosed  Thursday it's responding to a cybersecurity incident involving a breach of its network and that it's in touch with law enforcement authorities.  The New York Times first  reported  the incident.  The company pointed to its tweeted statement when asked for comment on the matter.   The hack is said to have forced the company to take its internal communications and engineering systems offline as it investigated the extent of the breach.  The publication said the malicious intruder compromised an employee's Slack account, and leveraged it to broadcast a message that the company had "suffered a data breach," in addition to listing internal databases that's supposed to have been compromised.  "It appeared that the hacker was later able to gain access to other internal systems, posting an explicit photo on an internal information page for employees," the New York Times said.

Gamers looking for cheats on YouTube are being targeted with links to malicious password-protected archive files designed to install the RedLine Stealer malware and crypto miners on compromised machines.  "The videos advertise cheats and cracks and provide instructions on hacking popular games and software," Kaspersky security researcher Oleg Kupreev  said  in a new report published today.   Games mentioned in the videos are APB Reloaded, CrossFire, DayZ, Farming Simulator, Farthest Frontier, FIFA 22, Final Fantasy XIV, Forza, Lego Star Wars, Sniper Elite, and Spider-Man, among others.   Downloading the self-extracting RAR archive leads to the execution of Redline Stealer, a coin miner, as well as a number of other binaries that enable the bundle's self-propagation.  Specifically, this is achieved by means of an open-source C#-based password stealer that's capable of extracting cookies from browsers, which is then used by the operators to gain unauthorized access to

An ongoing espionage campaign operated by the Russia-linked Gamaredon group is targeting employees of Ukrainian government, defense, and law enforcement agencies with a piece of custom-made information stealing malware.  "The adversary is using phishing documents containing lures related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine," Cisco Talos researchers Asheer Malhotra and Guilherme Venere  said  in a technical write-up shared with The Hacker News. "LNK files, PowerShell, and VBScript enable initial access, while malicious binaries are deployed in the post-infection phase."  Active since 2013, Gamaredon – also known as Actinium, Armageddon, Primitive Bear, Shuckworm, and Trident Ursa – has been linked to numerous attacks aimed at Ukrainian entities in the aftermath of Russia's military invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor tracked under the moniker Webworm  has been linked to bespoke Windows-based remote access trojans, some of which are said to be in pre-deployment or testing phases.  "The group has developed customized versions of three older remote access trojans (RATs), including  Trochilus RAT ,  Gh0st RAT , and  9002 RAT ," the Symantec Threat Hunter team, part of Broadcom Software,  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.   The cybersecurity firm said at least one of the indicators of compromise (IOCs) was used in an attack against an IT service provider operating in multiple Asian countries.  It's worth pointing out that all the three backdoors are primarily associated with Chinese threat actors such as Stone Panda (APT10), Aurora Panda (APT17), Emissary Panda (APT27), and Judgement Panda (APT31), among others, although they have been put to use by other hacking groups.  Symantec said the Webworm threat actor exhibits tactical overlaps with another new adversa

The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Wednesday announced sweeping sanctions against ten individuals and two entities backed by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for their involvement in ransomware attacks at least since October 2020.  The agency said the cyber activity mounted by the individuals is partially attributable to intrusion sets tracked under the names APT35, Charming Kitten, Nemesis Kitten, Phosphorus, and TunnelVision.  "This group has launched extensive campaigns against organizations and officials across the globe, particularly targeting U.S. and Middle Eastern defense, diplomatic, and government personnel, as well as private industries including media, energy, business services, and telecommunications," the Treasury  said .  The Nemesis Kitten actor, which is also known as  Cobalt Mirage ,  DEV-0270 , and  UNC2448 , has come under the scanner in recent months for its pattern of ransomware attacks for o

The operators behind the Lornenz ransomware operation have been observed exploiting a now-patched critical security flaw in Mitel MiVoice Connect to obtain a foothold into target environments for follow-on malicious activities.  "Initial malicious activity originated from a Mitel appliance sitting on the network perimeter," researchers from cybersecurity firm Arctic Wolf  said  in a report published this week.  "Lorenz exploited  CVE-2022-29499 , a remote code execution vulnerability impacting the Mitel Service Appliance component of MiVoice Connect, to obtain a reverse shell and subsequently used  Chisel  as a tunneling tool to pivot into the environment."   Lorenz, like many other ransomware groups, is known for double extortion by exfiltrating data prior to encrypting systems, with the actor targeting small and medium businesses (SMBs) located in the U.S., and to a lesser extent in China and Mexico, since at least February 2021.

A Linux variant of a backdoor known as SideWalk was used to target a Hong Kong university in February 2021, underscoring the cross-platform abilities of the implant.   Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, which detected the malware in the university's network, attributed the backdoor to a nation-state actor dubbed  SparklingGoblin . The unnamed university is said to have been already targeted by the group in May 2020 during the  student protests .  "The group continuously targeted this organization over a long period of time, successfully compromising multiple key servers, including a print server, an email server, and a server used to manage student schedules and course registrations," ESET  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 has detailed the inner workings of a malware called  OriginLogger , which has been touted as a successor to the widely used information stealer and remote access trojan (RAT) known as  Agent Tesla .  A .NET based keylogger and remote access, Agent Tesla has had a long-standing presence in the threat landscape, allowing malicious actors to gain remote access to targeted systems and beacon sensitive information to an actor-controlled domain.  Known to be used in the wild since 2014, it's advertised for sale on dark web forums and is generally distributed through malicious spam emails as an attachment.  In February 2021, cybersecurity firm Sophos  disclosed two new variants  of the commodity malware (version 2 and 3) that featured capabilities to steal credentials from web browsers, email apps, and VPN clients, as well as use Telegram API for command-and-control.   Now according to Unit 42 researcher Jeff White, what has been tagged as AgentTesla version 3

Tech giant Microsoft on Tuesday shipped fixes to quash  64 new security flaws  across its software lineup, including one zero-day flaw that has been actively exploited in real-world attacks.  Of the 64 bugs, five are rated Critical, 57 are rated Important, one is rated Moderate, and one is rated Low in severity. The patches are in addition to  16 vulnerabilities  that Microsoft addressed in its Chromium-based Edge browser earlier this month.  "In terms of CVEs released, this Patch Tuesday may appear on the lighter side in comparison to other months," Bharat Jogi, director of vulnerability and threat research at Qualys, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.  "However, this month hit a sizable milestone for the calendar year, with MSFT having fixed the 1000th CVE of 2022 – likely on track to surpass 2021 which patched 1,200 CVEs in total."   The actively exploited vulnerability in question is  CVE-2022-37969  (CVSS score: 7.8), a privilege escalation flaw

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A zero-day flaw in the latest version of a WordPress premium plugin known as  WPGateway  is being actively exploited in the wild, potentially allowing malicious actors to completely take over affected sites.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-3180  (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue is being weaponized to add a malicious administrator user to sites running the WPGateway plugin, WordPress security company Wordfence noted.  "Part of the plugin functionality exposes a vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attackers to insert a malicious administrator," Wordfence researcher Ram Gall  said  in an advisory.   WPGateway is billed as a means for site administrators to install, backup, and clone WordPress plugins and themes from a unified dashboard.  The most common indicator that a website running the plugin has been compromised is the presence of an administrator with the username "rangex."  Additionally, the appearance of requests to "//wp-content/plugins/wpgateway/wpgateway-webse

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Contemporary organizations understand the importance of data and its impact on improving interactions with customers, offering quality products or services, and building loyalty.  Data is fundamental to business success. It allows companies to make the right decisions at the right time and deliver the high-quality, personalized products and services that customers expect.  There is a challenge, though.  Businesses are collecting more data than ever before, and new technologies have accelerated this process dramatically. As a result, organizations have significant volumes of data, making it hard to manage, protect, and get value from it.  Here is where Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) comes in. GRC enables companies to define and implement the best practices, procedures, and governance to ensure the data is clean, safe, and reliable across the board.   More importantly,  organizations can use GRC platforms like StandardFusion  to create an organizational culture around security.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government and state-owned organizations in a number of Asian countries have been targeted by a distinct group of espionage hackers as part of an intelligence gathering mission that has been underway since early 2021.  "A notable feature of these attacks is that the attackers leveraged a wide range of legitimate software packages in order to load their malware payloads using a technique known as  DLL side-loading ," the Symantec Threat Hunter team, part of Broadcom Software,  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The campaign is said to be exclusively geared towards government institutions related to finance, aerospace, and defense, as well as state-owned media, IT, and telecom firms.   Dynamic-link library (DLL) side-loading is a popular cyberattack method that leverages how Microsoft Windows applications handle DLL files. In these intrusions, a spoofed malicious DLL is planted in the Windows Side-by-Side ( WinSxS ) directory so that the operating system loads it

Iranian Hackers Target High-Value Targets in Nuclear Security and Genomic Research<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/iranian-hackers-target-high-value.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Hackers tied to the Iranian government have been targeting individuals specializing in Middle Eastern affairs, nuclear security, and genome research as part of a new social engineering campaign designed to hunt for sensitive information.  Enterprise security firm Proofpoint attributed the targeted attacks to a threat actor named  TA453 , which broadly overlaps with cyber activities monitored under the monikers APT42, Charming Kitten, and Phosphorus.  It all starts with a phishing email impersonating legitimate individuals at Western foreign policy research organizations that's ultimately designed to gather intelligence on behalf of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).  Spoofed personas include people from Pew Research Center, the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FRPI), the U.K.'s Chatham House, and the scientific journal Nature. The technique is said to have been deployed in mid-June 2022.  What's different from other phishing attacks is the use of a tact

Apple Releases iOS and macOS Updates to Patch Actively Exploited Zero-Day Flaw<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/apple-releases-ios-and-macos-updates-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple has released another round of security updates to address multiple vulnerabilities in iOS and macOS, including a new zero-day flaw that has been used in attacks in the wild.  The issue, assigned the identifier  CVE-2022-32917 , is rooted in the Kernel component and could enable a malicious app to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.  "Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited," the iPhone maker acknowledged in a brief statement, adding it resolved the bug with improved bound checks.  An anonymous researcher has been credited with reporting the shortcoming. It's worth noting that CVE-2022-32917 is also the  second Kernel related zero-day flaw  that Apple has remediated in less than a month.   Patches are available in versions  iOS 15.7, iPadOS 15.7 ,  iOS 16 ,  macOS Big Sur 11.7 , and  macOS Monterey 12.6 . The iOS and iPadOS updates cover iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 2 and later, iPad 5th generati

A hacktivist collective called  GhostSec  has claimed credit for compromising as many as 55 Berghof programmable logic controllers ( PLCs ) used by Israeli organizations as part of a "Free Palestine" campaign.  Industrial cybersecurity firm OTORIO, which  dug deeper  into the incident, said the breach was made possible owing to the fact that the PLCs were accessible through the Internet and were secured by trivially guessable credentials.  Details of the compromise first came to light on September 4 after GhostSec shared a video on its Telegram channel demonstrating a successful login to the PLC's admin panel, in addition to dumping data from the hacked controllers.  The Israeli company said the system dumps and screenshots were exported directly from the admin panel following unauthorized access to the controllers through their public IP addresses.   GhostSec (aka Ghost Security), first identified in 2015, is a self-proclaimed  vigilante group  that was initially formed

SOC 2 may be a voluntary standard, but for today's security-conscious business, it's a minimal requirement when considering a SaaS provider. Compliance can be a long and complicated process, but a scanner like  Intruder  makes it easy to tick the vulnerability management box.  Security is critical for all organisations, including those that outsource key business operations to third parties like SaaS vendors and cloud providers. Rightfully so, since mishandled data – especially by application and network security providers – can leave organisations vulnerable to attacks, such as data theft, extortion and malware.  But how secure are the third parties you've entrusted with your data? SOC 2 is a framework that ensures these service providers securely manage data to protect their customers and clients. For security-conscious businesses – and security should be a priority for every business today – SOC 2 is now a minimal requirement when considering a SaaS provider.  What SOC

High-Severity Firmware Security Flaws Left Unpatched in HP Enterprise Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/high-severity-firmware-security-flaws.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A number of firmware security flaws uncovered in HP's business-oriented high-end notebooks continue to be left unpatched in some devices even months after public disclosure.  Binarly, which first  revealed details  of the issues at the  Black Hat USA conference  in mid-August 2022, said the vulnerabilities "can't be detected by firmware integrity monitoring systems due to limitations of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) measurement."  Firmware flaws can have serious implications as they can be abused by an adversary to achieve long-term persistence on a device in a manner that can survive reboots and evade traditional operating system-level security protections.   The high-severity weaknesses identified by Binarly affect HP EliteBook devices and concern a case of memory corruption in the System Management Mode (SMM) of the firmware, thereby enabling the execution of arbitrary code with the highest privileges -   CVE-2022-23930  (CVSS score: 8.2) - Stack-based buffer

A state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actor newly christened APT42 (formerly UNC788) has been attributed to over 30 confirmed espionage attacks against individuals and organizations of strategic interest to the Iranian government at least since 2015.  Cybersecurity firm Mandiant said the group operates as the intelligence gathering arm of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), not to mention shares partial overlaps with another cluster called  APT35 , which is also known as Charming Kitten, Cobalt Illusion, ITG18, Phosphorus, TA453, and Yellow Garuda.  APT42 has exhibited a propensity to strike various industries such as non-profits, education, governments, healthcare, legal, manufacturing, media, and pharmaceuticals spanning at least 14 countries, including in Australia, Europe, the Middle East, and the U.S.  Intrusions aimed at the pharmaceutical sector are also notable for the fact that they commenced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, i

The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday announced sanctions against Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and its Minister of Intelligence, Esmaeil Khatib, for engaging in cyber-enabled activities against the nation and its allies.  "Since at least 2007, the MOIS and its cyber actor proxies have conducted malicious cyber operations targeting a range of government and private-sector organizations around the world and across various critical infrastructure sectors," the Treasury  said .  The agency also accused Iranian state-sponsored actors of  staging disruptive attacks  aimed at Albanian government computer systems in mid-July 2022, an incident that forced the latter to temporarily suspend its online services.  The development comes months nearly nine months after the U.S. Cyber Command characterized the advanced persistent threat (APT) known as MuddyWater as a  subordinate element  within MOIS. It also comes almost two years following the Treasury's sa

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security threats are always a concern when it comes to APIs. API security can be compared to driving a car. You must be cautious and review everything closely before releasing it into the world. By failing to do so, you're putting yourself and others at risk.  API attacks are more dangerous than other breaches. Facebook had a 50M user account affected by an API breach, and an API data breach on the Hostinger account exposed 14M customer records.   If a hacker gets into your API endpoints, it could spell disaster for your project. Depending on the industries and geographies you're talking about, insecure APIs could get you into hot water. Especially in the EU, if you're serving the banking, you could face massive legal and compliance problems if you're discovered to be using insecure APIs.   To mitigate these risks, you need to be aware of the potential  API vulnerabilities  that cybercriminals can exploit.    6 Commonly Overlooked API Security Risks  #1 No API Visibili

More than $30 million worth of cryptocurrency plundered by the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group from online video game Axie Infinity has been recovered, marking the first time digital assets stolen by the threat actor have been seized.  "The seizures represent approximately 10% of the total funds stolen from Axie Infinity (accounting for price differences between time stolen and seized), and demonstrate that it is becoming more difficult for bad actors to successfully cash out their ill-gotten crypto gains," Erin Plante, senior director of investigations at Chainalysis,  said .  The development arrives more than five months after the  crypto hack  resulted in the theft of $620 million from the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Ronin Network, with the attackers laundering a majority of the proceeds – amounting to $455 million – through the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency tumbler Tornado Cash.

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Baxter's internet-connected infusion pumps used by healthcare professionals in clinical environments to dispense medication to patients.  "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in access to sensitive data and alteration of system configuration," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)  said  in a coordinated advisory.  Infusion pumps are internet-enabled devices used by hospitals to deliver medication and nutrition directly into a patient's circulatory system.  The four vulnerabilities in question, discovered by  cybersecurity firm Rapid7  and reported to Baxter in April 2022, affect the following Sigma Spectrum Infusion systems -   Sigma Spectrum v6.x model 35700BAX  Sigma Spectrum v8.x model 35700BAX2  Baxter Spectrum IQ (v9.x) model 35700BAX3  Sigma Spectrum LVP v6.x Wireless Battery Modules v16, v16D38, v17, v17D19, v20D29 to v20D32, and v22D24 to v22D28  Sig

North Korean Lazarus Hackers Targeting Energy Providers Around the World<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/north-korean-lazarus-hackers-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious campaign mounted by the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group  targeted energy providers around the world, including those based in the United States, Canada, and Japan, between February and July 2022.  "The campaign is meant to infiltrate organizations around the world for establishing long-term access and subsequently exfiltrating data of interest to the adversary's nation-state," Cisco Talos  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Some elements of the espionage attacks have already entered public domain, courtesy of prior reports from Broadcom-owned  Symantec  and  AhnLab  earlier this April and May. Symantec attributed the operation to a group referred to as Stonefly, a Lazarus subgroup which is better known as Andariel, Guardian of Peace, OperationTroy, and Silent Chollima.   While these attacks previously led to the instrumentation of Preft (aka Dtrack) and NukeSped (aka Manuscrypt) implants, the latest attack wave is notable for employing two other pieces of mal

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese hacking group has been attributed to a new campaign aimed at infecting government officials in Europe, the Middle East, and South America with a modular malware known as PlugX.  Cybersecurity firm Secureworks said it identified the intrusions in June and July 2022, once again demonstrating the adversary's continued focus on espionage against governments around the world.  "PlugX is modular malware that contacts a command and control (C2) server for tasking and can download additional plugins to enhance its capability beyond basic information gathering," Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.   Bronze President is a China-based threat actor active since at least July 2018 and is likely estimated to be a state-sponsored group that leverages a mix of proprietary and publicly available tools to compromise and collect data from its targets.

A recent report revealed that ecommerce provider,  Shopify uses particularly weak password policies  on the customer-facing portion of its Website. According to the report, Shopify's requires its customers to use a password that is at least five characters in length and that does not begin or end with a space.   According to the report, Specops researchers analyzed a list of a billion passwords that were known to have been breached and found that 99.7% of those passwords adhere to Shopify's requirements. While this is not meant to suggest that Shopify customers' passwords have been breached, the fact that so many known breached passwords adhere to Shopify's minimum password requirements does underscore the dangers associated with using weak passwords.  The danger of weak passwords in your Active Directory   A recent study by Hive Systems  echoes the dangers of using weak passwords.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft's threat intelligence division on Wednesday assessed that a subgroup of the Iranian threat actor tracked as  Phosphorus  is conducting ransomware attacks as a "form of moonlighting" for personal gain.  The tech giant, which is monitoring the activity cluster under the moniker  DEV-0270  (aka Nemesis Kitten), said it's operated by a company that functions under the public aliases Secnerd and Lifeweb, citing infrastructure overlaps between the group and the two organizations.  "DEV-0270 leverages exploits for high-severity vulnerabilities to gain access to devices and is known for the early adoption of newly disclosed vulnerabilities," Microsoft  said .   "DEV-0270 also extensively uses living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBINs) throughout the attack chain for discovery and credential access. This extends to its abuse of the built-in BitLocker tool to encrypt files on compromised devices."  The use of BitLocker and DiskCryptor by Iranian actor

Cisco Releases Security Patches for New Vulnerabilities Impacting Multiple Products<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/cisco-releases-security-patches-for-new.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco on Wednesday rolled out patches to address  three security flaws  affecting its products, including a high-severity weakness disclosed in NVIDIA Data Plane Development Kit (MLNX_DPDK) late last month.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-28199  (CVSS score: 8.6), the vulnerability stems from a lack of proper error handling in DPDK's network stack, enabling a remote adversary to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition and cause an impact on data integrity and confidentiality.  "If an error condition is observed on the device interface, the device may either reload or fail to receive traffic, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition," Cisco  said  in a notice published on September 7.   DPDK  refers to a set of libraries and optimized network interface card (NIC) drivers for fast packet processing, offering a framework and common API for high-speed networking applications.  Cisco said it investigated its product lineup and determined the following services to be affecte

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Former members of the Conti cybercrime cartel have been implicated in five different campaigns targeting Ukraine from April to August 2022.  The findings, which come from Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), builds upon a  prior report  published in July 2022, detailing the continued cyber activity aimed at the Eastern European nation amid the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war.  "UAC-0098 is a threat actor that historically delivered the  IcedID banking trojan , leading to human-operated ransomware attacks," TAG researcher Pierre-Marc Bureau  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.   "The attacker has recently shifted their focus to targeting Ukrainian organizations, the Ukrainian government, and European humanitarian and non-profit organizations."  UAC-0098 is believed to have functioned as an initial access broker for ransomware groups such as Quantum and  Conti  (aka FIN12, Gold Ulrick, or Wizard Spiker), the former of which was  subsumed by Conti  in Apri

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new piece of stealthy Linux malware called Shikitega has been uncovered adopting a multi-stage infection chain to compromise endpoints and IoT devices and deposit additional payloads.  "An attacker can gain full control of the system, in addition to the cryptocurrency miner that will be executed and set to persist," AT&T Alien Labs  said  in a new report published Tuesday.  The findings add to a growing list of Linux malware that has been found in the wild in recent months, including  BPFDoor ,  Symbiote ,  Syslogk ,  OrBit , and  Lightning Framework .   Once deployed on a targeted host, the attack chain downloads and executes the Metasploit's " Mettle " meterpreter to maximize control, exploits vulnerabilities to elevate its privileges, adds persistence on the host via crontab, and ultimately launches a cryptocurrency miner on infected devices.  The exact method by which the initial compromise is achieved remains unknown as yet, but what makes Shikitega

The prolific North Korean nation-state actor known as the Lazarus Group has been linked to a new remote access trojan called  MagicRAT .  The previously unknown piece of malware is said to have been deployed in victim networks that had been initially breached via successful exploitation of internet-facing VMware Horizon servers, Cisco Talos said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "While being a relatively simple RAT capability-wise, it was built with recourse to the  Qt Framework , with the sole intent of making human analysis harder, and automated detection through machine learning and heuristics less likely," Talos researchers Jung soo An, Asheer Malhotra, and Vitor Ventura  said .   Lazarus Group , also known as APT38, Dark Seoul, Hidden Cobra, and Zinc, refers to a cluster of financial motivated and espionage-driven  cyber activities  undertaken by the North Korean government as a means to sidestep sanctions imposed on the country and meet its strategic objectives

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cyberattacks on large organizations dominate news headlines. So, you may be surprised to learn that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are actually  more frequent  targets of cyberattacks. Many SMEs understand this risk firsthand.   In a recent  survey , 58% of CISOs of SMEs said that their risk of attack was higher compared to enterprises. Yet, they don't have the same resources as enterprises – making it nearly impossible to protect their organizations from widespread and increasingly more sophisticated attacks that don't discriminate based on company size.  What's their solution?  Extended detection and response (XDR).   During a recent webinar, Cynet's Director of Product Strategy, George Tubin ,  and guest speaker Senior Analyst at Forrester,Allie Mellen, discussed the most serious cybersecurity challenges for SMEs and how they can benefit from XDR platforms.   Here are the four key takeaways from the  conversation .   The Biggest Cybersecurity Challenges for SME

A variant of the Mirai botnet known as MooBot is co-opting vulnerable D-Link devices into an army of denial-of-service bots by taking advantage of multiple exploits.  "If the devices are compromised, they will be fully controlled by attackers, who could utilize those devices to conduct further attacks such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42  said  in a Tuesday report.  MooBot, first disclosed by Qihoo 360's Netlab team in September 2019, has previously targeted  LILIN digital video recorders  and  Hikvision video surveillance products  to expand its network.   In the latest wave of attacks discovered by Unit 42 in early August 2022, as many as four different flaws in D-Link devices, both old and new, have paved the way for the deployment of MooBot samples. These include -   CVE-2015-2051  (CVSS score: 10.0) - D-Link HNAP SOAPAction Header Command Execution Vulnerability  CVE-2018-6530  (CVSS score: 9.8) - D-Link SOAP Interface Re

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Networking equipment maker Zyxel has released patches for a critical security flaw impacting its network-attached storage (NAS) devices.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-34747  (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue relates to a "format string vulnerability" affecting NAS326, NAS540, and NAS542 models. Zyxel credited researcher Shaposhnikov Ilya for reporting the flaw.  "A format string vulnerability was found in a specific binary of Zyxel NAS products that could allow an attacker to achieve unauthorized remote code execution via a crafted UDP packet," the company  said  in an advisory released on September 6.   The flaw affects the following versions -   NAS326 (V5.21(AAZF.11)C0 and earlier)  NAS540 (V5.21(AATB.8)C0 and earlier), and  NAS542 (V5.21(ABAG.8)C0 and earlier)   The disclosure comes as Zyxel previously addressed local privilege escalation and authenticated directory traversal vulnerabilities ( CVE-2022-30526 and CVE-2022-2030 ) affecting its firewall products in July.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
High-profile companies and local governments located primarily in Asia are the subjects of targeted attacks by a previously undocumented espionage group dubbed  Worok  that has been active since late 2020.  "Worok's toolset includes a C++ loader CLRLoad, a PowerShell backdoor PowHeartBeat, and a C# loader PNGLoad that uses steganography to extract hidden malicious payloads from PNG files," ESET researcher Thibaut Passilly  said  in a new report published today.  Worok is said to share overlaps in tools and interests with another adversarial collective tracked as  TA428 , with the group linked to attacks against entities spanning energy, financial, maritime, and telecom sectors in Asia as well as a government agency in the Middle East and a private firm in southern Africa.   Malicious activities undertaken by the group experienced a noticeable break from May 2021 to January 2022, before resuming the next month. The Slovak cybersecurity firm assessed the group's goals

"It opportunistically adopts new technologies in order to gain leverage over victims before the wider cybersecurity industry catches on."  Also tracked under the names Evil Corp, Gold Drake, Dudear, Indrik Spider, and SectorJ04, TA505 is an aggressive  Russian cybercrime syndicate  behind the infamous Dridex banking trojan and which has been linked to a  number of ransomware campaigns  in recent years.    It's also said to be connected to the  Raspberry Robin attacks  that emerged in September 2021, with similarities uncovered between the malware and Dridex.

SecDevOps is, just like DevOps, a transformational change that organizations undergo at some point during their lifetime. Just like many other big changes, SecDevOps is commonly adopted after a reality check of some kind: a big damaging cybersecurity incident, for example.  A major security breach or, say, consistent problems in achieving development goals signals to organizations that the existing development framework doesn't work and that something new is needed. But what exactly is SecDevOps, why should you embrace it – and how can you do it more easily in practice?  The fundamentals of SecDevOps  By itself, SecDevOps is not just one single improvement. You may see it as a new tool, or set of tools, or perhaps a different mindset. Some might see SecDevOps as a culture. In reality, it's all of those factors wrapped into a new approach to development that's intended to put security first.  SecDevOps rely on highly reproducible scenarios, touching on topics such as system

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit dubbed EvilProxy is being advertised on the criminal underground as a means for threat actors to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) protections employed against online services.  "EvilProxy actors are using reverse proxy and cookie injection methods to bypass 2FA authentication – proxifying victim's session," Resecurity researchers  said  in a Monday write-up.   The platform generates phishing links that are nothing but cloned pages designed to compromise user accounts associated with Apple iCloud, Facebook, GoDaddy, GitHub, Google, Dropbox, Instagram, Microsoft, NPM, PyPI, RubyGems, Twitter, Yahoo, and Yandex, among others.  EvilProxy is similar to adversary-in-the-middle ( AiTM ) attacks in that users interact with a malicious proxy server that acts as a go-between for the target website, covertly harvesting the credentials and 2FA passcodes entered in the login pages.  It's offered on a subscription basis per service

A previously undocumented strain of Android spyware with extensive information gathering capabilities has been found disguised as a book likely designed to target the  Uyghur community  in China.

QNAP has issued a new advisory urging users of its network-attached storage (NAS) devices to upgrade to the latest version of  Photo Station  following yet another wave of  DeadBolt ransomware attacks  in the wild by exploiting a zero-day flaw in the software.

Popular short-form social video service TikTok denied reports that it was breached by a hacking group, after it claimed to have gained access to an insecure cloud server.  "TikTok prioritizes the privacy and security of our users' data," the ByteDance-owned company told The Hacker News. "Our security team investigated these claims and found no evidence of a security breach."  The denial follows alleged reports of a hack that surfaced on the Breach Forums message board on September 3, with the threat actor noting that the server holds 2.05 billion records in a humongous 790GB database.   "Who would have thought that TikTok would decide to store all their internal backend source code on one Alibaba Cloud instance using a trashy password?," the hacking group known as BlueHornet (aka  AgainstTheWest )  tweeted  over the weekend.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Not all security teams are born equal. Each organization has a different objective.  In cybersecurity, adopting a proactive approach is not just a buzzword. It actually is what makes the difference between staying behind attackers and getting ahead of them. And the solutions to do that do exist!  Most attacks succeed by taking advantage of common failures in their target's systems. Whether new or not, known, unknown, or even unknown, attacks leverage security gaps such as   unpatched or uncharted vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, out-of-date systems, expired certificates, human errors, etc.  As attackers rely on a range of automated offensive testing tools to scan their targets' attack surfaces and propagate inside their network, a purely reactive defensive stance based on detection and response is increasingly likely to be overwhelmed by an attack.  The logical tactical move is to emulate attackers' TTPs and behaviors beforehand by integrating attack simulation tools to

Ransomware Attackers Abuse Genshin Impact Anti-Cheat System to Disable Antivirus<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/ransomware-attackers-abuse-genshin.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A vulnerable anti-cheat driver for the Genshin Impact video game has been leveraged by a cybercrime actor to disable antivirus programs to facilitate the deployment of ransomware, according to findings from Trend Micro.  The ransomware infection, which was triggered in the last week of July 2022, banked on the fact that the driver in question ("mhyprot2.sys") is signed with a valid certificate, thereby making it possible to circumvent privileges and terminate services associated with endpoint protection applications.  Genshin Impact is a popular action role-playing game that was developed and published by Shanghai-based developer miHoYo in September 2020.   The driver used in the attack chain is said to have been built in August 2020, with the existence of the flaw in the module  discussed  after the release of the game, and leading to  exploits   demonstrating  the ability to kill any arbitrary process and escalate to kernel mode.  The idea, in a nutshell, is to use the leg

It stressed that the incident did not affect users' Social Security numbers or credit and debit card numbers, but noted the information leaked for each relevant customer may vary.

Google on Friday shipped emergency fixes to address a security vulnerability in the Chrome web browser that it said is being actively exploited in the wild.  The issue, assigned the identifier  CVE-2022-3075 , concerns a case of insufficient data validating in  Mojo , which refers to a collection of runtime libraries that provide a platform-agnostic mechanism for inter-process communication (IPC).

"Google is aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2022-3075 exists in the wild," the internet giant  said , without delving into additional specifics about the nature of the attacks to prevent additional threat actors from taking advantage of the flaw.   The latest update makes it the sixth zero-day vulnerability in Chrome that Google has resolved since the start of the year -   CVE-2022-0609  - Use-after-free in Animation  CVE-2022-1096  - Type confusion in V8  CVE-2022-1364  -

Researchers discovered a private Telegram channel-based backdoor in the information stealing malware, dubbed Prynt Stealer , which its developer added with the intention of secretly stealing a copy of victims' exfiltrated data when used by other cybercriminals.  "While this untrustworthy behavior is nothing new in the world of cybercrime, the victims' data end up in the hands of multiple threat actors, increasing the risks of one or more large scale attacks to follow," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Atinderpal Singh and Brett Stone-Gross  said  in a new report.  Prynt Stealer, which  came to light  earlier this April, comes with capabilities to log keystrokes, steal credentials from web browsers, and siphon data from Discord and Telegram. It's sold for $100 for a one-month license and $900 for a lifetime subscription.   The cybersecurity firm analysis of Prynt Stealer shows that its codebase is derived from two other open source malware families,  AsyncRAT  and

JuiceLedger Hackers Behind the Recent Phishing Attacks Against PyPI Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/juiceledger-hackers-behind-recent.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More details have emerged about the operators behind the  first-known phishing campaign  specifically aimed at the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official third-party software repository for the programming language.  Connecting it to a threat actor tracked as  JuiceLedger , cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, along with Checkmarx, described the group as a relatively new entity that surfaced in early 2022.  Initial "low-key" campaigns are said to have involved the use of rogue Python installer applications to deliver a .NET-based malware called JuiceStealer that's engineered to siphon passwords and other sensitive data from victims' web browsers.   The attacks received a significant facelift last month when the JuiceLedger actors  targeted PyPi package contributors  in a phishing campaign, resulting in the compromise of three packages with malware.   "The supply chain attack on PyPI package contributors appears to be an escalation of a campaign begun earlier in th

How much time do developers spend actually writing code?  According to recent studies , developers spend more time maintaining, testing and securing existing code than they do writing or improving code. Security vulnerabilities have a bad habit of popping up during the software development process, only to surface after an application has been deployed. The disappointing part is that many of these security flaws and bugs could have been resolved in an earlier stage and there are proper methods and tools to uncover them.  How much time does a developer spend on learning to write a functioning code? And how much is spent on learning about code security? Or learning how not to code?"  Wouldn't it be better to eradicate the problem from the system rather than having it there, and then trying to detect and stop an ongoing attack targeting it?  You can test your secure coding skills with this short  self-assessment.  The true cost of bugs  Everyone makes mistakes, even developers.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In another finding that could expose developers to increased risk of a supply chain attack, it has emerged that nearly one-third of the packages in PyPI, the Python Package Index, trigger automatic code execution upon downloading them.  "A worrying feature in pip/PyPI allows code to automatically run when developers are merely downloading a package," Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb  said  in a technical report published this week.  "Also, this feature is alarming due to the fact that a great deal of the malicious packages we are finding in the wild use this feature of code execution upon installation to achieve higher infection rates."  One of the ways by which packages can be installed for Python is by executing the " pip install " command, which, in turn, invokes a file called "setup.py" that comes bundled along with the module.   "setup.py," as the name implies, is a  setup script  that's used to specify metadata associated wit

New Evidence Links Raspberry Robin Malware to Dridex and Russian Evil Corp Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/new-evidence-links-raspberry-robin.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have identified functional similarities between a malicious component used in the Raspberry Robin infection chain and a Dridex malware loader, further strengthening the operators' connections to the Russia-based Evil Corp group.  The findings suggest that "Evil Corp is likely using Raspberry Robin infrastructure to carry out its attacks," IBM Security X-Force researcher Kevin Henson  said  in a Thursday analysis.  Raspberry Robin (aka QNAP Worm), first  discovered  by cybersecurity company Red Canary in September 2021, has remained something of a mystery for nearly a year, partly owing to the noticeable lack of post-exploitation activities in the wild.   That changed in July 2022 when Microsoft  revealed  that it observed the  FakeUpdates  (aka SocGholish) malware being delivered via existing Raspberry Robin infections, with potential connections identified between DEV-0206 and DEV-0243 (aka Evil Corp).  The malware is known to be delivered from a compromised

So far 2022 confirms that passwords are not dead yet. Neither will they be anytime soon. Even though Microsoft and Apple are championing passwordless authentication methods, most applications and websites will not remove this option for a very long time.  Think about it, internal apps that you do not want to integrate with third-party identity providers, government services, legacy applications, and even SaaS providers may not want to invest in new integrations or restrict their existing authentication methods. After all, online businesses are interested in user traction, and security usually brings friction. For example, a few days ago,  Kickstarter sent out millions of password reset  emails "simplifying its login process," including for people that used social login without a password.   Though you may be able to remove passwords from many enterprise components, a large portion of third-party providers, government portals, business suppliers, and SaaS services will still

The operators of the emerging cross-platform BianLian ransomware have increased their command-and-control (C2) infrastructure this month, a development that alludes to an increase in the group's operational tempo.  BianLian, written in the Go programming language, was first discovered in mid-July 2022 and has claimed 15 victim organizations as of September 1, cybersecurity firm [redacted] said in a  report  shared with The Hacker News.  It's worth noting that the double extortion ransomware family has no connection to an  Android banking trojan  of the same name, which targets mobile banking and cryptocurrency apps to siphon sensitive information.   Initial access to victim networks is achieved via successful exploitation of the  ProxyShell  Microsoft Exchange Server flaws, leveraging it to either drop a web shell or an ngrok payload for follow-on activities.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have identified 1,859 apps across Android and iOS containing hard-coded Amazon Web Services (AWS) credentials, posing a major security risk.  "Over three-quarters (77%) of the apps contained valid AWS access tokens allowing access to private AWS cloud services," Symantec's Threat Hunter team, a part of Broadcom Software, said in a  report  shared with The Hacker News.  Interestingly, a little more than 50% of the apps were found using the same AWS tokens found in other apps maintained by other developers and companies, indicating a supply chain vulnerability.   "The AWS access tokens could be traced to a shared library, third-party SDK, or other shared component used in developing the apps," the researchers said.  These credentials are typically used for downloading appropriate resources necessary for the app's functions as well as accessing configuration files and authenticating to other cloud services.  To make matters worse, 47% of the identi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The attack infrastructure used to  target Cisco  in the May 2022 incident was also employed against an attempted compromise of an unnamed workforce management solutions holding company a month earlier in April 2022.  Cybersecurity firm Sentire, which  disclosed  the findings, raised the possibility that the intrusions could be the work of a criminal actor known as mx1r, who is said to be a member of the Evil Corp affiliate cluster dubbed  UNC2165 .  Evil Corp, the progenitors of the infamous Dridex banking trojan, have, over the years, refined their modus operandi to run a series of ransomware operations to sidestep sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury in December 2019.   Initial access to the company's IT network was made possible by using stolen Virtual Private Network (VPN) credentials, followed by leveraging off-the-shelf tools for lateral movement and gaining deeper access into the victim's environment.  "Using Cobalt Strike, the attackers were able to gain an init

Microsoft Discover Severe 'One-Click' Exploit for TikTok Android App<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/microsoft-discover-severe-one-click.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Wednesday disclosed details of a now-patched "high severity vulnerability" in the TikTok app for Android that could let attackers take over accounts when victims clicked on a malicious link.  "Attackers could have leveraged the vulnerability to hijack an account without users' awareness if a targeted user simply clicked a specially crafted link," Dimitrios Valsamaras of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team  said  in a write-up.  Successful exploitation of the flaw could have permitted malicious actors to access and modify users' TikTok profiles and sensitive information, leading to the unauthorized exposure of private videos. Attackers could also have abused the bug to send messages and upload videos on behalf of users.   The issue, addressed in version 23.7.3, impacts two flavors of its Android app com.ss.android.ugc.trill (for East and Southeast Asian users) and com.zhiliaoapp.musically (for users in other countries except for India, wher

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple on Wednesday backported security updates to older iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch devices to address a  critical security flaw  that has been actively exploited in the wild.  The issue, tracked as  CVE-2022-32893  (CVSS score: 8.8), is an out-of-bounds write issue affecting WebKit that could lead to arbitrary code execution when processing maliciously crafted web content.   The tech giant said it fixed the bug with improved bounds checking. An anonymous researcher has been credited for reporting the vulnerability.  The iOS 12.5.6 update is available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air, iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3, and iPod touch (6th generation).  "iOS 12 is not impacted by CVE-2022-32894," Apple  noted  in its advisory.  The latest set of patches arrived weeks after the iPhone maker  remediated the two flaws  in iOS 15.6.1, iPadOS 15.6.1, macOS 12.5.1, and Safari 15.6.1 as part of updates shipped on August 18, 2022.

A persistent Golang-based malware campaign dubbed GO#WEBBFUSCATOR has leveraged the deep field image taken from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as a lure to deploy malicious payloads on infected systems.  The development, revealed by Securonix , points to the growing adoption of Go among threat actors, given the programming language's cross-platform support, effectively allowing the operators to leverage a common codebase to target different operating systems.  Go binaries also have the added benefit of rendering reverse engineering a lot more challenging as opposed to malware written in other languages like C++ or C#, not to mention prolong analysis and detection attempts.  Phishing emails containing a Microsoft Office attachment act as the entry point for the attack chain that, when opened, retrieves an obfuscated VBA macro, which, in turn, is auto-executed should the recipient enable macros.   The execution of the macro results in the download of an image file &quo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat landscape has changed dramatically over the past decade. While cybercriminals continue to look for new ways to gain access to networks and steal sensitive information, the mobile attack surface is also expanding.  Mobile devices are not only becoming more powerful but also more vulnerable to cyberattacks, making mobile security an increasingly important concern for enterprises.  This means that anyone accessing the Internet via their cell phone or logging into their home or work network at any time is putting both their own personal data and that of their company at risk.  No matter how big or small your business is, you should always take steps to ensure the security of your employees and customers. Recent global attacks have shown us just how vulnerable businesses are to cyberattacks.  There are several ways hackers can attack mobile devices. To protect their data, businesses should take a comprehensive approach that addresses both internal and external threats.  Jamf Thr

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Monday introduced a new bug bounty program for its open source projects, offering payouts anywhere from $100 to $31,337 (a reference to  eleet or leet ) to secure the ecosystem from  supply chain attacks .  Called the Open Source Software Vulnerability Rewards Program (OSS VRP), the offering is one of the first open source-specific vulnerability programs.  With the tech giant the maintainer of major projects such as Angular, Bazel, Golang, Protocol Buffers, and Fuchsia, the program aims to reward vulnerability discoveries that could otherwise have a significant impact on the larger open source landscape.   Other projects managed by Google and hosted on public repositories such as GitHub as well as the third-party dependencies that are included in those projects are also eligible.   Submissions  from bug hunters are expected to meet the following criteria -   Vulnerabilities that lead to supply chain compromise  Design issues that cause product vulnerabilities  Other security

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A months-long cyber espionage campaign undertaken by a Chinese nation-state group targeted several entities with reconnaissance malware so as to glean information about its victims and meet its strategic goals.  "The targets of this recent campaign spanned Australia, Malaysia, and Europe, as well as entities that operate in the South China Sea," enterprise security firm Proofpoint  said  in a published in partnership with PwC.  Targets encompass local and federal Australian Governmental agencies, Australian news media companies, and global heavy industry manufacturers which conduct maintenance of fleets of wind turbines in the South China Sea.  Proofpoint and PwC attributed the intrusions with moderate confidence to a threat actor tracked by the two companies under the names TA423 and Red Ladon respectively, which is also known as APT40 and Leviathan.  APT40 is the name designated to a China-based, espionage-motivated threat actor that's known to be active since 2013 and

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as three disparate but related campaigns between March and Jun 2022 have been found to deliver a variety of malware, including ModernLoader, RedLine Stealer, and cryptocurrency miners onto compromised systems.  "The actors use PowerShell, .NET assemblies, and HTA and VBS files to spread across a targeted network, eventually dropping other pieces of malware, such as the  SystemBC  trojan and  DCRat , to enable various stages of their operations," Cisco Talos researcher Vanja Svajcer said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.   The malicious implant in question, ModernLoader , is designed to provide attackers with remote control over the victim's machine, which enables the adversaries to deploy additional malware, steal sensitive information, or even ensnare the computer in a botnet.  Cisco Talos attributed the infections to a previously undocumented but Russian-speaking threat actor, citing the use of off-the-shelf tools. Potential targets included Eastern Eur

As threat complexity increases and the boundaries of an organization have all but disappeared, security teams are more challenged than ever to deliver consistent security outcomes. One company aiming to help security teams meet this challenge is  Stellar Cyber .   Stellar Cyber claims to address the needs of MSSPs by providing capabilities typically found in NG-SIEM, NDR, and SOAR products in their Open XDR platform, managed with a single license. According to Stellar Cyber, this consolidation means faster security analyst ramp time and customer onboarding with far less manually intensive tasks required. Stellar Cyber currently counts 20+ of the top MSSP providers as customers, providing security for over 3 million assets. In addition, stellar Cyber claims after deployment, users see up to 20x faster mean time to respond (MTTR), a bold claim.  We recently took a closer look at the Stellar Cyber Security Operations Platform.   Before we begin  Before digging into the platform, here are

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Monday warned of cyber criminals increasingly exploiting flaws in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to plunder cryptocurrency.  "The FBI has observed cyber criminals exploiting vulnerabilities in the smart contracts governing DeFi platforms to steal investors' cryptocurrency," the agency  said  in a notification.  Attackers are said to have used different methods to hack and steal cryptocurrency from DeFi platforms, including initiating flash loans that trigger exploits in the platforms' smart contracts and exploiting signature verification flaws in their token bridge to withdraw all investments.   The agency has also observed criminals defrauding the platforms by manipulating cryptocurrency price pairs – assets that can be traded for each other on an exchange – by exploiting a series of vulnerabilities to bypass  slippage checks  and steal roughly $35 million in digital funds.  It further said that the threat ac

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday said it filed a lawsuit against Kochava, a location data broker, for collecting and selling precise geolocation data gathered from consumers' mobile devices.  The complaint alleges that the U.S. company  amasses  a "wealth of information" about users by purchasing data from other data brokers to sell to its own clients.  "Kochava then sells customized data feeds to its clients to, among other purposes, assist in advertising and analyzing foot traffic at stores or other locations," the FTC  said . "Among other categories, Kochava sells timestamped latitude and longitude coordinates showing the location of mobile devices."  The company advertises itself as a "real-time data solutions company" and the "largest independent data marketplace for connected devices." It also claims its  Kochava Collective  data marketplace provides "premium data feeds, audience targeting, and audience

A new ransomware strain written in Golang dubbed " Agenda " has been spotted in the wild, targeting healthcare and education entities in Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Thailand.  "Agenda can reboot systems in safe mode, attempts to stop many server-specific processes and services, and has multiple modes to run," Trend Micro researchers  said  in an analysis last week.  Qilin, the threat actor advertising the ransomware on the dark web, is said to provide affiliates with options to tailor the binary payloads for each victim, enabling the operators to decide the ransom note, encryption extension, as well as the list of processes and services to terminate before commencing the encryption process.   Additionally, the ransomware incorporates techniques for detection evasion by taking advantage of the 'safe mode' feature of a device to proceed with its file encryption routine unnoticed, but not before changing the default user's password and enabl

A Turkish-speaking entity called Nitrokod  has been attributed to an active cryptocurrency mining campaign that involves impersonating a desktop application for Google Translate to infect over 111,000 victims in 11 countries since 2019.   "The malicious tools can be used by anyone," Maya Horowitz, vice president of research at Check Point, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. "They can be found by a simple web search, downloaded from a link, and installation is a simple double-click."  The list of countries with victims includes the U.K., the U.S., Sri Lanka, Greece, Israel, Germany, Turkey, Cyprus, Australia, Mongolia, and Poland.   The  campaign  entails serving malware through free software hosted on popular sites such as Softpedia and Uptodown. But in an interesting tactic, the malware puts off its execution for weeks and separates its malicious activity from the downloaded fake software to avoid detection.

Twilio Breach Also Compromised Authy Two-Factor Accounts of Some Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/twilio-breach-also-compromised-authy.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Twilio, which earlier this month became a  sophisticated phishing attack , disclosed last week that the threat actors also managed to gain access to the accounts of 93 individual users of its Authy two-factor authentication (2FA) service.  The communication tools company  said  the unauthorized access made it possible for the adversary to register additional devices to those accounts. It has since identified and removed the illegitimately added devices from the impacted accounts.  Authy, acquired by Twilio in February 2015, allows  safeguarding online accounts  with a second security layer to prevent account takeover attacks. It's estimated to have nearly 75 million users.  Twilio further noted its investigation as of August 24, 2022, turned up 163 affected customers, up from 125 it reported on August 10, whose accounts it said were hacked for a limited period of time.   Besides Twilio, the sprawling campaign, dubbed  0ktapus  by Group-IB, is believed to have struck 136 companies,

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday added 10 new actively exploited vulnerabilities to its  Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , including a high-severity security flaw affecting industrial automation software from Delta Electronics.  The issue, tracked as  CVE-2021-38406  (CVSS score: 7.8), impacts DOPSoft 2 versions 2.00.07 and prior. A successful exploitation of the flaw may lead to arbitrary code execution.  "Delta Electronics DOPSoft 2 lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing specific project files (improper input validation) resulting in an out-of-bounds write that allows for code execution," CISA said in an alert.  It's worth noting that CVE-2021-38406 was originally disclosed as part of an industrial control systems (ICS) advisory  published  in September 2021.   However, there are no patches that address the vulnerability, with CISA noting that the "impacted product is end-of-life and shoul

Iranian Hackers Exploiting Unpatched Log4j 2 Bugs to Target Israeli Organizations<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/iranian-hackers-exploiting-unpatched.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Iranian state-sponsored actors are leaving no stone unturned to exploit unpatched systems running Log4j to target Israeli entities, indicating the vulnerability's  long tail  for remediation.  Microsoft attributed the latest set of activities to the  umbrella threat group  tracked as  MuddyWater  (aka Cobalt Ulster, Mercury, Seedworm, or Static Kitten), which is  linked  to the Iranian intelligence apparatus, the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).   The attacks are notable for using SysAid Server instances unsecured against the  Log4Shell flaw  as a vector for initial access,  marking  a  departure  from the actors' pattern of leveraging VMware applications for breaching target environments.  "After gaining access, Mercury establishes persistence, dumps credentials, and moves laterally within the targeted organization using both custom and well-known hacking tools, as well as built-in operating system tools for its hands-on-keyboard attack," Microsoft  said .

No customer data or encrypted passwords were accessed, although the company provided no further details regarding the hack and what source code was stolen.   "An unauthorized party gained access to portions of the LastPass development environment through a single compromised developer account and took portions of source code and some proprietary LastPass technical information," LastPass CEO Karim Toubba  said .  Amidst ongoing investigation into the incident, the company said it has engaged the services of a leading cybersecurity and forensics firm and that it has implemented additional countermeasures.   LastPass, however, didn't elaborate on the exact mitigation techniques that it used to strengthen its environment. It also reiterated that the

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Nation-state threat actors are  increasingly adopting  and integrating the Sliver  command-and-control (C2) framework in their intrusion campaigns as a replacement for Cobalt Strike.  "Given Cobalt Strike's popularity as an attack tool, defenses against it have also improved over time," Microsoft security experts  said . "Sliver thus presents an attractive alternative for actors looking for a lesser-known toolset with a low barrier for entry."  Sliver, first made public in late 2019 by cybersecurity company BishopFox, is a Go-based  open source C2 platform  that supports user-developed extensions, custom implant generation, and other commandeering options.   "A C2 framework usually includes a server that accepts connections from implants on a compromised system, and a client application that allows the C2 operators to interact with the implants and launch malicious commands," Microsoft said.  Besides facilitating long-term access to infected hosts, the cross-platform kit is also known

The threat actor behind the attacks on  Twilio  and  Cloudflare  earlier this month has been linked to a broader phishing campaign aimed at 136 organizations that resulted in a cumulative compromise of 9,931 accounts.  The activity has been condemned  0ktapus  by Group-IB because the initial goal of the attacks was to "obtain Okta identity credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes from users of the targeted organizations."  Calling the attacks well designed and executed, the Singapore-headquartered company said the adversary singled out employees of companies that are customers of identity services provider Okta.   The modus operandi involved sending targets text messages containing links to phishing sites that impersonated the Okta authentication page of the respective targeted entities.  "This case is of interest because despite using low-skill methods it was able to compromise a large number of well-known organizations," Group-IB  said . "Furthe

The threat actor behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack has been linked to yet another "highly targeted" post-exploitation malware that could be used to maintain persistent access to compromised environments.

Nobelium is the tech giant's moniker for a cluster of activities that came to light with the  sophisticated attack targeting SolarWinds  in December 2020, and which overlaps with the Russian nation-state hacking group widely known as  APT29 , Cozy Bear, or The Dukes.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In recent months, the House of Representatives has been hard at work drafting various spending bills for the 2023 fiscal year. While these bills provide funding for a vast array of government programs and agencies, there was one thing that really stands out. Collectively, the bills that are making their way through the house  allocate a staggering $15.6 billion to cybersecurity spending .  As you could probably guess, the lion's share of this spending ($11.2 billion) is being allocated to the Department of Defense. It is worth noting, however, that nearly $3 billion is going to the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).  Although it may be tempting to think of these cybersecurity budget allocations as just another example of excessive government spending, it's worth considering what a $15.6 billion cash infusion will mean for the IT security industry. It's equally important to consider why the US government finds it necessary to ramp up its cybersecurity

The North Korean nation-state group Kimusky has been linked to a new set of malicious activities directed against political and diplomatic entities located in its southern counterpart in early 2022.  Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky codenamed the cluster  GoldDragon , with the infection chains leading to the deployment of Windows malware designed to file lists, user keystrokes, and stored web browser login credentials.  Included among the potential victims are South Korean university professors, think tank researchers, and government officials.    Kimsuky , also known as Black Banshee, Thallium, and Velvet Chollima, is the name given to a prolific North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) group that targets entities globally, but with a primary focus on South Korea, to gain intelligence on various topics of interest to the regime.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Python Package Index, PyPI, on Wednesday sounded the alarm about an ongoing phishing campaign that aims to steal developer credentials and inject malicious updates to legitimate packages.  "This is the first known phishing attack against PyPI," the maintainers of the official third-party software repository  said  in a series of tweets.  The social engineering attack entails sending security-themed messages that create a false sense of urgency by informing recipients that Google is implementing a mandatory validation process on all packages and that they need to click on a link to complete the validation before September, or risk getting their PyPI modules removed.   Should an unsuspecting developer fall for the scheme, users are directed to a lookalike landing page that mimics PyPI's login page and is hosted on Google Sites, from where the entered credentials are captured and abused to unauthorizedly access the accounts and compromise the packages to include malware

A security researcher who has a long line of work demonstrating novel data exfiltration methods from air-gapped systems has come up with yet another technique that involves sending Morse code signals via LEDs on network interface cards ( NICs ).  The approach, codenamed  ETHERLED , comes from Dr. Mordechai Guri , the head of R&D in the Cyber Security Research Center in the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, who recently outlined  GAIROSCOPE , a method for transmitting data ultrasonically to smartphone gyroscopes.   "Malware installed on the device could programmatically control the status LED by blinking or alternating its colors, using documented methods or undocumented firmware commands," Dr. Guri said.  "Information can be encoded via simple encoding such as Morse code and modulated over these optical signals. An attacker can intercept and decode these signals from tens to hundreds of meters away."   A network interface card, also known as a netwo

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
From ransomware to breaches, from noncompliance penalties to reputational damage – cyberthreats pose an existential risk to any business. But for SMEs and SMBs, the danger is compounded. These companies realize they  need  an in-house Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) – someone who can assess risks and vulnerabilities, create and execute a comprehensive cybersecurity plan, ensure compliance and safeguard business continuity. Yet unlike large enterprises, most don't have the budget to bring a full-time experienced CISO on board.  To bridge this gap, managed service providers (MSPs), managed security service providers (MSSPs), and consulting firms offer virtual CISO (vCISO), or 'CISO-as-a-service' services. The model is simple: instead of hiring a full-time CISO, SMEs and SMBs pay a subscription or a retainer to gain access to expert cyber assistance in the form of a virtual CISO. Staffed by seasoned veteran executives, vCISOs offer C-level assistance in devising and

WordPress sites are being hacked to display fraudulent Cloudflare DDoS protection pages that lead to the delivery of malware such as NetSupport RAT and Raccoon Stealer.  "A recent surge in JavaScript injections targeting WordPress sites has resulted in fake DDoS prevent prompts which lead victims to download remote access trojan malware," Sucuri's Ben Martin  said  in a write-up published last week.  Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection pages are essential browser verification checks designed to deter bot-driven unwanted and malicious traffic from eating up bandwidth and taking down websites.  The new attack vector involves hijacking WordPress sites to display fake DDoS protection pop-ups that, when clicked, ultimately lead to the download of a malicious ISO file ("security_install.iso") to the victim's systems.   This is achieved by injecting three lines of code into a JavaScript file ("jquery.min.js"), or alternatively into the active

The threat actors behind a large-scale adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM)  phishing campaign  targeting enterprise users of Microsoft email services have also set their sights on Google Workspace users.  "This campaign specifically targeted chief executives and other senior members of various organizations which use [Google Workspace]," Zscaler researchers Sudeep Singh and Jagadeeswar Ramanukolanu  detailed  in a report published this month.   The AiTM phishing attacks are said to have commenced in mid-July 2022, following a similar modus operandi as that of a  social engineering campaign  designed to siphon users' Microsoft credentials and even bypass multi-factor authentication.  The low-volume Gmail AiTM phishing campaign also entails using the compromised emails of chief executives to conduct further social engineering, with the attacks also utilizing several compromised domains as an intermediate URL redirector to take the victims to the final landing page.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
DevOps platform GitLab this week issued patches to address a critical security flaw in its software that could lead to arbitrary code execution on affected systems.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-2884 , the issue is rated 9.9 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system and impacts all versions of GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE) starting from 11.3.4 before 15.1.5, 15.2 before 15.2.3, and 15.3 before 15.3.1.  At its core, the security weakness is a case of authenticated remote code execution that can be triggered via the GitHub import API. GitLab credited  yvvdwf  with discovering and reporting the flaw.   While the issue has been resolved in versions 15.3.1, 15.2.3, 15.1.5, users also have the option of securing against the flaw by temporarily disabling the GitHub import option -   Click "Menu" -> "Admin"  Click "Settings" -> "General"  Expand the "Visibility and access controls" tab  Under "Import sources"

The Iranian government-backed actor known as Charming Kitten has added a new tool to its malware arsenal that allows it to retrieve user data from Gmail, Yahoo!, and Microsoft Outlook accounts.  Dubbed  HYPERSCRAPE  by Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG), the actively in-development malicious software is said to have been used against less than two dozen accounts in Iran, with the oldest known sample dating back to 2020. The tool was first discovered in December 2021.  Charming Kitten, a prolific advanced persistent threat (APT), is believed to be  associated  with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and has a history of conducting espionage aligned with the interests of the government.   Tracked as APT35, Cobalt Illusion, ITG18, Phosphorus, TA453, and Yellow Garuda, elements of the group have also carried out ransomware attacks, suggesting that the threat actor's motives are both espionage and financially driven.

XCSSET, first  documented  by Trend Micro in 2020, has many moving parts that allow it to  harvest sensitive information  from Apple Notes, WeChat, Skype, and Telegram; inject malicious JavaScript code into various websites; and dump cookies from Safari web browser.

Ransomware is the de facto threat organizations have faced over the past few years. Threat actors were making easy money by exploiting the high valuation of cryptocurrencies and their victims' lack of adequate preparation.   Think about bad security policies, untested backups, patch management practices not up-to-par, and so forth. It resulted in easy growth for ransomware extortion, a crime that multiple threat actors around the world perpetrate.   Something's changed, though. Crypto valuations have dropped, reducing the monetary appeal of ransomware attacks due to organizations mounting a formidable defense against ransomware.  Threat actors have been searching for another opportunity – and found one. It's called data exfiltration, or exfil, a type of espionage causing headaches at organizations worldwide. Let's take a look.  The threat to reveal confidential information  Information exfiltration is rapidly becoming more prevalent. Earlier this year, incidents at Nvi

Suspected Iranian Hackers Targeted Several Israeli Organizations for Espionage<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/suspected-iranian-hackers-targeted.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected Iranian threat activity cluster has been linked to attacks aimed at Israeli shipping, government, energy, and healthcare organizations as part of an espionage-focused campaign that commenced in late 2020.  Cybersecurity firm Mandiant is tracking the group under its uncategorized moniker  UNC3890 , which is believed to conduct operations that align with Iranian interests.  "The collected data may be leveraged to support various activities, from hack-and-leak, to enabling kinetic warfare attacks like those that have plagued the shipping industry in recent years," the company's Israel Research Team  noted .   Intrusions mounted by the group lead to the deployment of two proprietary pieces of malware: a "small but efficient" backdoor named SUGARUSH and a browser credential stealer called SUGARDUMP that exfiltrates password information to an email address associated with Gmail, ProtonMail, Yahoo, and Yandex.  Also employed is a network of command-and-con

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details of an eight-year-old security vulnerability in the Linux kernel have emerged that the researchers say is "as nasty as Dirty Pipe."  Dubbed  DirtyCred  by a group of academics from Northwestern University, the security weakness exploits a previously unknown flaw ( CVE-2022-2588 ) to escalate privileges to the maximum level.  "DirtyCred is a kernel exploitation concept that swaps unprivileged  kernel credentials  with privileged ones to escalate privilege," researchers Zhenpeng Lin, Yuhang Wu, and Xinyu Xing noted. "Instead of overwriting any critical data fields on kernel heap, DirtyCred abuses the heap memory reuse mechanism to get privileged."   This entails three steps -   Free an in-use unprivileged credential with the vulnerability  Allocate privileged credentials in the freed memory slot by triggering a privileged userspace process such as su, mount, or sshd  Operate as a privileged user   The novel exploitation method, according to the resea

Atlanta-based cyber risk intelligence company, Cyble discovered a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) malware. What makes this particular RAT malware distinct enough to be named after the  comic creation of Sacha Baron Cohen ?  RAT malware typically helps cybercriminals gain complete control of a victim's system, permitting them to access network resources, files, and power to toggle the mouse and keyboard. Borat RAT malware goes beyond the standard features and enables threat actors to deploy ransomware and  DDoS attacks . It also increases the number of threat actors who can launch attacks, sometimes appealing to the lowest common denominator. The added functionality of carrying out DDoS attacks makes it insidious and a risk to today's digital organizations.  Ransomware has been the most common top attack type for over  three years . According to an IBM report, REvil was the most common ransomware strain, consisting of about  37%  of all ransomware attacks. Borat RAT is a unique

Researchers have disclosed multiple vulnerabilities impacting Ultra-wideband (UWB) Real-time Locating Systems ( RTLS ), enabling threat actors to launch adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks and tamper with location data.  "The zero-days found specifically pose a security risk for workers in industrial environments," cybersecurity firm Nozomi Networks  disclosed  in a technical write-up last week. "If a threat actor exploits these vulnerabilities, they have the ability to tamper with safety zones designated by RTLS to protect workers in hazardous areas."   RTLS is used to automatically identify and track the location of objects or people in real-time, usually within a confined indoor area. This is achieved by making use of tags that are attached to assets, which broadcast USB signals to fixed reference points called anchors that then determine their location.  But flaws identified in RTLS solutions –  Sewio Indoor Tracking RTLS UWB Wi-Fi Kit  and  Avalue Renity Ar

Bitcoin ATM manufacturer General Bytes confirmed that it was a victim of a cyberattack that exploited a previously unknown flaw in its software to plunder cryptocurrency from its users.  "The attacker was able to create an admin user remotely via CAS administrative interface via a URL call on the page that is used for the default installation on the server and creating the first administration user," the company  said  in an advisory last week. "This vulnerability has been present in CAS software since version 2020-12-08."   It's not immediately clear how many servers were breached using this flaw and how much cryptocurrency was stolen.  CAS is short for  Crypto Application Server , a self-hosted product from General Bytes that enables companies to manage Bitcoin ATM ( BATM ) machines from a central location via a web browser on a desktop or a mobile device.  The zero-day flaw, which concerned a bug in the CAS admin interface, has been mitigated in two server p

The ongoing attacks, which commenced in June 2022, have been observed to target automotive, civil and industrial construction, logistics, and machinery sectors via multiple infection chains in Mexico and chemicals manufacturing industries in Spain.

The Donot Team  threat actor has updated its Jaca  Windows malware toolkit with improved capabilities, including a revamped stealer module designed to plunder information from Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers.  The improvements also include a new infection chain that incorporates previously undocumented components to the modular framework, Morphisec researchers Hido Cohen and Arnold Osipov  disclosed  in a report published last week.  Also known as APT-C-35 and Viceroy Tiger, the Donot Team is known for setting its sights on defense, diplomatic, government, and military entities in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, among others at least since 2016.  Evidence unearthed by Amnesty International in October 2021  connected  the group's attack infrastructure to an Indian cybersecurity company called Innefu Labs.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A financially motivated cybercrime group has been linked to an ongoing wave of attacks aimed at hospitality, hotel, and travel organizations in Latin America with the goal of installing malware on compromised systems.  Enterprise security firm Proofpoint, which is tracking the group under the name TA558 dating all the way back to April 2018, called it a "small crime threat actor."  "Since 2018, this group has used consistent tactics, techniques, and procedures to attempt to install a variety of malware including Loda RAT, Vjw0rm, and Revenge RAT," the company's threat research team  said  in a new report.  The group has been operational at a higher tempo in 2022 than usual, with intrusions mainly geared towards Portuguese and Spanish speakers in Latin America, and to a lesser extent in Western Europe and North America.   Phishing campaigns mounted by the group involve sending malicious spam messages with reservation-themed lures such as hotel bookings that cont

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google's cloud division on Thursday disclosed it mitigated a series of HTTPS distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks which peaked at 46 million requests per second (RPS), making it the largest such recorded to date.  The attack, which occurred on June 1, targeting an unnamed Google Cloud Armor customer, is 76% larger than the  26 million RPS DDoS attack  repealed by Cloudflare earlier this June.   "To give a sense of the scale of the attack, that is like receiving all the daily requests to Wikipedia (one of the top 10 trafficked websites in the world) in just 10 seconds," Google Cloud's Emil Kiner and Satya Konduru  said .  It's said to have started around 9:45 a.m. PT with 10,000 RPS, before growing to 100,000 RPS eight minutes later and further ramping up within two minutes to hit a high of 46 million RPS at 10:18 a.m. PT. In all, the DDoS assault lasted for a total of 69 minutes.   Google said that the unexpectedly high volume of traffic originated from 5

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Retail giant Amazon patched a high-severity security issue in its Ring app for Android in May that could have enabled a rogue application installed on a user's device to access sensitive information and camera recordings.  The Ring app for Android has over 10 million downloads and enables users to monitor video feeds from smart home devices such as video doorbells, security cameras, and alarm systems. Amazon acquired the doorbell maker for about $1 billion in 2018.  Application security firm Checkmarx  explained  it identified a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw that it said could be weaponized as part of an attack chain to trick victims into installing a malicious app.   The app can then be used to get hold of the user's Authorization Token, that can be subsequently leveraged to extract the session cookie by sending this information alongside the device's hardware ID, which is also encoded in the token, to the endpoint "ring[.]com/mobile/authorize."

Researchers Detail Evasive DarkTortilla Crypter Used to Deliver Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/researchers-detail-evasive-darktortilla.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A .NET-based evasive crypter named  DarkTortilla  has been used by threat actors to distribute a broad array of commodity malware as well as targeted payloads like Cobalt Strike and Metasploit, likely  since 2015 .  "It can also deliver 'add-on packages' such as additional malicious payloads, benign decoy documents, and executables," cybersecurity firm Secureworks  said  in a Wednesday report. "It features robust anti-analysis and anti-tamper controls that can make detection, analysis, and eradication challenging."  Malware delivered by the crypter includes information steakers and remote access trojans (RATs) such as Agent Tesla, AsyncRat, NanoCore, and RedLine Stealer. "DarkTortilla has versatility that similar malware does not," the researchers noted.   Crypters are  software tools  that use a  combination  of encryption, obfuscation, and code manipulation of malware so as to  bypass detection  by security solutions.  The delivery of DarkTortil

The Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) actor tracked as Winnti (aka APT41) has targeted at least 13 organizations geographically spanning across the U.S, Taiwan, India, Vietnam, and China against the backdrop of four different campaigns in 2021.  "The targeted industries included the public sector, manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, hospitality, education, as well as the media and aviation," cybersecurity firm Group-IB  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.   This also included the attack on Air India that came to light in June 2021 as part of a campaign codenamed  ColunmTK . The other three campaigns have been assigned the monikers DelayLinkTK, Mute-Pond, and Gentle-Voice based on the domain names used in the attacks.  APT41, also known as Barium, Bronze Atlas, Double Dragon, Wicked Panda, or Winnti, is a  prolific   Chinese   cyber threat group  that's known to carry out state-sponsored espionage activity in parallel with financially motivated operati

Hackers Using Bumblebee Loader to Compromise Active Directory Services<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/hackers-using-bumblebee-loader-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The malware loader known as Bumblebee is being increasingly co-opted by threat actors associated with BazarLoader, TrickBot, and IcedID in their campaigns to breach target networks for post-exploitation activities.  "Bumblebee operators conduct intensive reconnaissance activities and redirect the output of executed commands to files for exfiltration," Cybereason researchers Meroujan Antonyan and Alon Laufer  said  in a technical write-up.   Bumblebee  first came to light in March 2022 when Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) unmasked the activities of an initial access broker dubbed  Exotic Lily  with ties to the  TrickBot  and the larger  Conti  collectives.   Typically delivered via initial access acquired through spear-phishing campaigns, the modus operandi has since been tweaked by eschewing macro-laced documents in favor of ISO and LNK files, primarily in response to Microsoft's decision to  block macros by default .

Penetration Testing or Vulnerability Scanning? What's the Difference?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/penetration-testing-or-vulnerability.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Pentesting and vulnerability scanning are often confused for the same service. The problem is, business owners often use one when they really need the other. Let's dive in and explain the differences.  People frequently confuse penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, and it's easy to see why. Both look for weaknesses in your IT infrastructure by exploring your systems in the same way an actual hacker would. However, there is a very important distinction between the two - and when each is the better option.  Manual or automated?  Penetration testing is a  manual  security assessment where cyber security professional attempts to find a way to break into your systems. It's a hands-on, in-depth test to evaluate security controls across a variety of systems, including web application, network and cloud environments. This kind of testing could take several weeks to complete, and due to its complexity and cost, is commonly carried out once a year.  Vulnerability scanning,

In a sign that malicious actors continue to find ways to work around Google Play Store security protections, researchers have spotted a previously undocumented Android dropper trojan that's currently in development.  "This new malware tries to abuse devices using a novel technique, not seen before in Android malware, to spread the extremely dangerous  Xenomorph  banking trojan, allowing criminals to perform On-Device Fraud on victim's devices," ThreatFabric's Han Sahin said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.  Dubbed  BugDrop  by the Dutch security firm, the  dropper app  is explicitly designed to defeat new features introduced in the upcoming version of Android that aim to make it difficult for malware to request Accessibility Services privileges from victims.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday rolled out patches for Chrome browser for desktops to contain an actively exploited high-severity zero-day flaw in the wild.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-2856 , the issue has been described as a case of insufficient validation of untrusted input in  Intents . Security researchers Ashley Shen and Christian Resell of Google Threat Analysis Group have been credited with reporting the flaw on July 19, 2022.  As is typically the case, the tech giant has refrained from sharing additional specifics about the shortcoming until a majority of the users are updated. "Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2022-2856 exists in the wild," it  acknowledged  in a terse statement.  The latest update further addresses 10 other security flaws, most of which relate to use-after-free bugs in various components such as FedCM, SwiftShader, ANGLE, and Blink, among others. Also fixed is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in Downloads.   The development marks the fifth zero-day vulnerab

A Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group named RedAlpha  has been attributed to a multi-year mass credential theft campaign aimed at global humanitarian, think tank, and government organizations.  "In this activity, RedAlpha very likely sought to gain access to email accounts and other online communications of targeted individuals and organizations," Recorded Future  disclosed  in a new report.   A lesser-known threat actor, RedAlpha was first  documented  by Citizen Lab in January 2018 and has a history of conducting cyber espionage and surveillance operations directed against the Tibetan community, some in India, to facilitate intelligence collection through the deployment of the NjRAT backdoor .   "The campaigns [...] combine light reconnaissance, selective targeting, and diverse malicious tooling," Recorded Future  noted  at the time.  Since then, malicious activities undertaken by the group have involved weaponizing as many as 350 domains that spoof leg

But you know what's even more overwhelming than rampant cybercrime?  Building your organization's security framework.   CIS, NIST, PCI DSS, HIPAA, HITrust, and the list goes on. Even if you had the resources to implement every relevant industry standard and control to a tee, you still couldn't keep your company from getting caught up in the next SolarWinds. Because textbook security and check-the-box compliance won't cut it. You've got to be strategic ( especially when manpower is limited! ). And lean.  Learn the ropes now.   3 Pro Tips for Building Your Lean Security Framework  Without a framework in place, you're either navigating the cyber-risk universe with blinders on — or buried so deep in false positives you couldn't spot a complex attack until it's already laterally advancing.

More than 1.31 million users attempted to install malicious or unwanted web browser extensions at least once, new findings from cybersecurity firm Kaspersky show.  "From January 2020 to June 2022, more than 4.3 million unique users were attacked by adware hiding in browser extensions, which is approximately 70% of all users affected by malicious and unwanted add-ons," the company  said .  As many as 1,311,557 users fall under this category in the first half of 2022, per Kaspersky's telemetry data. In comparison, the number of such users peaked in 2020 at 3,660,236, followed by 1,823,263 unique users in 2021.  The most prevalent threat is a family of adware called WebSearch, which masquerade as PDF viewers and other utilities, and comes with capabilities to collect and analyze search queries and redirect users to affiliate links.   WebSearch is also notable for modifying the browser's start page, which contains a search engine and a number of links to third-party sour

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korea-backed Lazarus Group has been observed targeting job seekers with malware capable of executing on Apple Macs with Intel and M1 chipsets.  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET linked it to a campaign dubbed " Operation In(ter)ception " that was first disclosed in June 2020 and involved using social engineering tactics to trick employees working in the aerospace and military sectors into opening decoy job offer documents.  The latest attack is no different in that a job description for the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange platform was used as a launchpad to drop a signed Mach-O executable. ESET's analysis comes from a sample of the binary that was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil on August 11, 2022.   "Malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon," the company  said  in a series of tweets. "It drops three files: a decoy PDF document ' Coinbase_online_careers_2022_07.pdf ', a bundle  'FinderFontsUpdater.app ,' and a downloa

RubyGems, the official package manager for the Ruby programming language, has become the latest platform to mandate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for popular package maintainers, following the footsteps of  NPM  and  PyPI .  To that end, owners of gems with over 180 million total downloads are mandated to turn on MFA effective August 15, 2022.   "Users in this category who do not have MFA enabled on the UI and API or UI and gem sign-in level will not be able to edit their profile on the web, perform privileged actions (i.e. push and yank gems, or add and remove gem owners), or sign in on the command line until they configure MFA," RubyGems  noted .  What's more, gem maintainers who cross 165 million cumulative downloads are expected to receive reminders to turn on MFA until the download count touches the 180 million thresholds, at which point it will be made mandatory.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of researchers has revealed details of a new vulnerability affecting Intel CPUs that enables attackers to obtain encryption keys and other secret information from the processors.  Dubbed  ÆPIC Leak , the weakness is the first-of-its-kind to architecturally disclose sensitive data in a manner that's akin to an "uninitialized memory read in the CPU itself."  "In contrast to transient execution attacks like  Meltdown and Spectre ,  ÆPIC Leak  is an architectural bug: the sensitive data gets directly disclosed without relying on any (noisy) side channel," the academics said.  The study was conducted by researchers from the Sapienza University of Rome, the Graz University of Technology, Amazon Web Services, and the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security.  The vulnerability ( CVE-2022-21233 , CVSS score: 6.0), which affects CPUs with Sunny Cover microarchitecture, is rooted in a component called Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller ( APIC ), wh

New Evil PLC Attack Weaponizes PLCs to Breach OT and Enterprise Networks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/new-evil-plc-attack-weaponizes-plcs-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have elaborated a novel attack technique that weaponizes programmable logic controllers ( PLCs ) to gain an initial foothold in engineering workstations and subsequently invade the operational technology (OT) networks.  Dubbed " Evil PLC " attack by industrial security firm Claroty, the issue impacts engineering workstation software from Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric, GE, B&R, Xinje, OVARRO, and Emerson.  Programmable logic controllers are a crucial component of industrial devices that control manufacturing processes in critical infrastructure sectors. PLCs, besides orchestrating the automation tasks, are also configured to start and stop processes and generate alarms.  It's hence not surprising that the entrenched access provided by PLCs have made the machines a focus of sophisticated attacks for more than a decade, starting from  Stuxnet to PIPEDREAM  (aka INCONTROLLER), with the goal of causing physical disruptions.    "The

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
UTM (Unified threat management) is thought to be an all-in-one solution for cybersecurity. In general, it is a versatile software or hardware firewall solution integrated with IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and other security services. A universal gateway allows the user to manage network security with one comprehensive solution, which makes the task much easier. In addition, compared to a conventional firewall, such systems are capable of detecting and blocking more sophisticated attacks. SafeDNS has recently released such a solution, and this is what this article is going to be about.  Who needs UTMs?  Most of all, UTMs are valued by SMEs - the all-in-one solution makes it simple to manage all their cybersecurity solutions and services. This also cuts down a lot of communications between vendors, since UTMs are easily supported by one IT team. This leads to another upside of the system - it can be cost-effective, as there is no need to pay a bunch of vendors & extra for tech

Microsoft on Monday revealed it took steps to disrupt phishing operations undertaken by a "highly persistent threat actor" whose objectives align closely with Russian state interests.  The company is tracking the espionage-oriented activity cluster under its chemical element-themed moniker  SEABORGIUM , which it said overlaps with a hacking group also known as  Callisto ,  COLDRIVER , and TA446.  "SEABORGIUM intrusions have also been linked to hack-and-leak campaigns, where stolen and leaked data is used to shape narratives in targeted countries," Microsoft's threat hunting teams  said . "Its campaigns involve persistent phishing and credential theft campaigns leading to intrusions and data theft."   Attacks launched by the adversarial collective are known to target the same organizations using consistent methodologies applied over long periods of time, enabling it to infiltrate the victims' social networks through a combination of impersonation,
