</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind the ransomware attack on Taiwanese PC maker MSI last month have leaked the company's private code signing keys on their dark website. "Confirmed, Intel OEM private key leaked, causing an impact on the entire ecosystem," Alex Matrosov, founder and CEO of firmware security firm Binarly,  said  in a tweet over the weekend. "It appears that Intel Boot Guard may not be effective on certain devices based on the 11th Tiger Lake, 12th Adler Lake, and 13th Raptor Lake." Present in the leaked data are firmware image signing keys associated with 57 PCs and private signing keys for Intel Boot Guard used on 116 MSI products. The Boot Guard keys from MSI are believed to impact several device vendors, including Intel, Lenovo and Supermicro. Intel Boot Guard is a  hardware-based security technology  that's designed to protect computers against executing tampered UEFI firmware. The development comes a month after MSI  fell victim  to a double

Digital storage giant Western Digital confirmed that an "unauthorized third party" gained access to its systems and stole personal information belonging to the company's online store customers. "This information included customer names, billing and shipping addresses, email addresses and telephone numbers," the San Jose-based company  said  in a disclosure last week. "In addition, the database contained, in encrypted format, hashed and salted passwords and partial credit card numbers. We will communicate directly with impacted customers." The development comes a little over a month after Western Digital  divulged  a "network security incident" on March 26, 2023, prompting the company to take its cloud services offline. A subsequent report from TechCrunch last month  revealed  that the threat actors behind the attack were allegedly in possession of "around 10 terabytes of data," and were negotiating with Western Digital for a r

The suspected Pakistan-aligned threat actor known as  SideCopy  has been observed leveraging themes related to the Indian military research organization as part of an ongoing phishing campaign. This involves using a ZIP archive lure pertaining to India's Defence Research and Development Organization ( DRDO ) to deliver a malicious payload capable of harvesting sensitive information, Fortinet FortiGuard Labs  said  in a new report. The cyber espionage group, with  activity  dating back to at least 2019, targets entities that align with Pakistan government interests. It's believed to share overlaps with another Pakistani hacking crew called  Transparent Tribe . SideCopy's use of DRDO-related decoys for malware distribution was previously flagged by  Cyble  and Chinese cybersecurity firm  QiAnXin  in March 2023, and again by  Team Cymru  last month. Interestingly, the same attack chains have been observed to load and execute Action RAT as well as an open source remote ac

How to Set Up a Threat Hunting and Threat Intelligence Program<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/how-to-set-up-threat-hunting-and-threat.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat hunting is an essential component of your cybersecurity strategy. Whether you're getting started or in an advanced state, this article will help you ramp up your threat intelligence program. What is Threat Hunting? The cybersecurity industry is shifting from a reactive to a proactive approach. Instead of waiting for cybersecurity alerts and then addressing them, security organizations are now deploying red teams to actively seek out breaches, threats and risks, so they can be isolated. This is also known as "threat hunting."  Why is Threat Hunting Required? Threat hunting complements existing prevention and detection security controls. These controls are essential for mitigating threats. However, they are optimized for low false positive alerting. Hunt solutions, on the other hand, are optimized for low false negatives. This means that the anomalies and outliers that are considered false positives for detection solutions, are hunting solutions' leads, to b

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing phishing campaign with invoice-themed lures is being used to distribute the SmokeLoader malware in the form of a polyglot file, according to the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA). The emails, per the  agency , are sent using compromised accounts and come with a ZIP archive that, in reality, is a  polyglot file  containing a decoy document and a JavaScript file. The JavaScript code is then used to launch an executable that paves for the execution of the  SmokeLoader malware . SmokeLoader, first detected in 2011, is a  loader  whose main objective is to download or load a stealthier or more effective malware onto infected systems. CERT-UA attributed the activity to a threat actor it calls UAC-0006 and characterized it as a financially motivated operation carried out with the goal of stealing credentials and making unauthorized fund transfers. In a related advisory, Ukraine's cybersecurity authority also revealed details of destructive attacks orch

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor known as  Dragon Breath  has been observed adding new layers of complexity to its attacks by adopting a novel  DLL side-loading  mechanism. "The attack is based on a classic side-loading attack, consisting of a clean application, a malicious loader, and an encrypted payload, with various modifications made to these components over time," Sophos researcher Gabor Szappanos  said . "The latest campaigns add a twist in which a first-stage clean application 'side'-loads a second clean application and auto-executes it. The second clean application side-loads the malicious loader DLL. After that, the malicious loader DLL executes the final payload." Operation Dragon Breath, also tracked under the names APT-Q-27 and Golden Eye, was  first   documented  by QiAnXin in 2020, detailing a watering hole campaign designed to trick users into downloading a trojanized Windows installer for Telegram. A  subsequent   campaign  de

Users of Advanced Custom Fields plugin for WordPress are being urged to update version 6.1.6 following the discovery of a security flaw. The issue, assigned the identifier CVE-2023-30777, relates to a case of reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) that could be abused to inject arbitrary executable scripts into otherwise benign websites. The plugin, which is available both as a free and pro version, has over  two million active installations . The issue was discovered and reported to the maintainers on May 2, 2023. "This vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user from stealing sensitive information to, in this case, privilege escalation on the WordPress site by tricking a privileged user to visit the crafted URL path," Patchstack researcher Rafie Muhammad  said . Reflected XSS  attacks usually occur when victims are tricked into clicking on a bogus link sent via email or another route, causing the malicious code to be sent to the vulnerable website, which reflects the

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Various sectors in East Asian markets have been subjected to a new email phishing campaign that distributes a previously undocumented strain of Android malware called  FluHorse  that abuses the Flutter software development framework. "The malware features several malicious Android applications that mimic legitimate applications, most of which have more than 1,000,000 installs," Check Point  said  in a technical report. "These malicious apps steal the victims' credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes." The malicious apps have been found to imitate popular apps like ETC and VPBank Neo, which are widely used in Taiwan and Vietnam. Evidence gathered so far shows that the activity has been active since at least May 2022.  The phishing scheme in itself is fairly straightforward, wherein victims are lured with emails that contain links to a bogus website that hosts malicious APK files. Also added to the website are checks that aim to screen victims an

Hackers Targeting Italian Corporate Banking Clients with New Web-Inject Toolkit DrIBAN<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/hackers-targeting-italian-corporate.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Italian corporate banking clients are the target of an ongoing financial fraud campaign that has been leveraging a new web-inject toolkit called  drIBAN  since at least 2019. "The main goal of drIBAN fraud operations is to infect Windows workstations inside corporate environments trying to alter legitimate banking transfers performed by the victims by changing the beneficiary and transferring money to an illegitimate bank account," Cleafy researchers Federico Valentini and Alessandro Strino  said . The bank accounts, per the Italian cybersecurity firm, are either controlled by the threat actors themselves or their affiliates, who are then tasked with laundering the stolen funds. The use of web injects is a time-tested tactic that makes it possible for malware to inject custom scripts on the client side by means of a man-in-the-browser ( MitB ) attack and intercept traffic to and from the server. The fraudulent transactions are often realized by means of a technique call

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Third-party apps such as Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, HotJar, and JQuery have become critical tools for businesses to optimize their website performance and services for a global audience. However, as their importance has grown, so has the threat of cyber incidents involving unmanaged third-party apps and open-source tools. Online businesses increasingly struggle to maintain complete visibility and control over the ever-changing third-party threat landscape, with sophisticated threats like evasive skimmers, Magecart attacks, and unlawful tracking practices potentially causing severe damage. This article explores the challenges of protecting modern websites from third-party scripts and the security risks associated with a lack of visibility over these scripts. Invisible to Standard Security Controls  Third-party scripts are often invisible to standard security controls like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) because they are loaded from external sources that are not under the control

A new Android subscription malware named  Fleckpe  has been unearthed on the Google Play Store, amassing more than 620,000 downloads in total since 2022. Kaspersky, which identified 11 apps on the official app storefront, said the malware masqueraded as legitimate photo editing apps, camera, and smartphone wallpaper packs. The apps have since been taken down. The operation primarily targets users from Thailand, although telemetry data gathered by the Russian cybersecurity firm has revealed victims in Poland, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore. The apps further offer the promised functionality to avoid raising red flags, but conceal their real purpose under the hood.

Cisco has warned of a critical security flaw in SPA112 2-Port Phone Adapters that it said could be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on affected devices. The issue, tracked as  CVE-2023-20126 , is rated 9.8 out of a maximum of 10 on the CVSS scoring system. The company credited Catalpa of DBappSecurity for reporting the shortcoming. The  product in question  makes it possible to connect analog phones and fax machines to a VoIP service provider without requiring an upgrade. "This vulnerability is due to a missing authentication process within the firmware upgrade function," the company  said  in a bulletin. "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by upgrading an affected device to a crafted version of firmware. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with full privileges." Despite the severity of the flaw, the networking equipment maker said it does not intend to release fixes

Three new security flaws have been disclosed in Microsoft Azure API Management service that could be abused by malicious actors to gain access to sensitive information or backend services. This includes two server-side request forgery (SSRF) flaws and one instance of unrestricted file upload functionality in the API Management developer portal, according to Israeli cloud security firm Ermetic. "By abusing the SSRF vulnerabilities, attackers could send requests from the service's CORS Proxy and the hosting proxy itself, access internal Azure assets, deny service and bypass web application firewalls," security researcher Liv Matan said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "With the file upload path traversal, attackers could upload malicious files to Azure's hosted internal workload."

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have found a way to exploit a recently disclosed critical flaw in PaperCut servers in a manner that bypasses all current detections. Tracked as  CVE-2023-27350  (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue affects PaperCut MF and NG installations that could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. While the flaw was  patched  by the Australian company on March 8, 2023, the first signs of active exploitation emerged on April 13, 2023. Since then, the vulnerability has been  weaponized  by multiple threat groups, including  ransomware actors , with post-exploitation activity resulting in the execution of PowerShell commands designed to drop additional payloads. Now, VulnCheck has  published  a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit that sidesteps existing detection signatures by leveraging the fact that "PaperCut NG and MF offer multiple paths to code execution." It's worth noting that public exploits for the fla

IT and cybersecurity teams are so inundated with security notifications and alerts within their own systems, it's difficult to monitor external malicious environments – which only makes them that much more threatening.  In March, a high-profile data breach hit national headlines when personally identifiable information connected to hundreds of lawmakers and staff was leaked on the dark web. The cybersecurity incident involved the DC Health Link, an online marketplace that administers health plans for members of Congress and Capitol Hill staff. According to news reports, the FBI had successfully purchased a portion of the data – which included social security numbers and other sensitive information – on the dark web.  Because of the prominence of the victims, the story was picked up by a slew of media outlets that rarely cover dark web-related cybersecurity crimes. The story not only shed light on one of the most dangerous aspects of the internet, it reminded us that the dark web con

Meta Uncovers Massive Social Media Cyber Espionage Operations Across South Asia<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/meta-uncovers-massive-social-media.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Three different threat actors leveraged hundreds of elaborate fictitious personas on Facebook and Instagram to target individuals located in South Asia as part of disparate attacks. "Each of these APTs relied heavily on social engineering to trick people into clicking on malicious links, downloading malware or sharing personal information across the internet," Guy Rosen, chief information security officer at Meta,  said . "This investment in social engineering meant that these threat actors did not have to invest as much on the malware side." The fake accounts, in addition to using traditional lures like women looking for a romantic connection, masqueraded as recruiters, journalists, or military personnel. At least two of the  cyber espionage efforts  entailed the use of low-sophistication malware with reduced capabilities, likely in an attempt to get past  app verification checks  established by Apple and Google.  One of the groups that came under Meta's r

Meta said it took steps to take down more than 1,000 malicious URLs from being shared across its services that were found to leverage OpenAI's ChatGPT as a lure to propagate about 10 malware families since March 2023. The development comes  against  the backdrop of  fake ChatGPT   web browser extensions  being increasingly used to steal users' Facebook account credentials with an aim to run unauthorized ads from hijacked business accounts. "Threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools," Meta  said . "They would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware." The social media giant said it has blocked several iterations of a multi-pronged malware campaign dubbed  Ducktail  over the years, adding it issued a cease and desist letter to individuals behind the operation who are located in Vietna

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Almost five months after Google  added support  for passkeys to its Chrome browser, the tech giant has begun rolling out the  passwordless solution  across Google Accounts on all platforms. Passkeys , backed by the FIDO Alliance, are a more secure way to sign in to apps and websites without having to use a traditional password. This, in turn, can be achieved by simply unlocking their computer or mobile device with their biometrics (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition) or a local PIN. "And, unlike passwords, passkeys are resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes," Google  noted . Passkeys, once created, are locally stored on the device, and are not shared with any other party. This also obviates the need for setting up two-factor authentication, as it proves that "you have access to your device and are able to unlock it." Users also have the choice of creating passkeys for every device they use to

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese state-sponsored hacking outfit has resurfaced with a new campaign targeting government, healthcare, technology, and manufacturing entities based in Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, and Fiji after more than six months of no activity. Trend Micro  attributed  the intrusion set to a cyber espionage group it tracks under the name  Earth Longzhi , which is a subgroup within  APT41  (aka HOODOO or Winnti) and shares overlaps with various other clusters known as Earth Baku, SparklingGoblin, and GroupCC. Earth Longzhi was  first documented  by the cybersecurity firm in November 2022, detailing its attacks against various organizations located in East and Southeast Asia as well as Ukraine. Attack chains mounted by the threat actor leverage vulnerable public-facing applications as entry points to deploy the  BEHINDER web shell , and then leverage that access to drop additional payloads, including a new variant of a Cobalt Strike loader called CroxLoader.

An international law enforcement operation has resulted in the arrest of 288 vendors who are believed to be involved in drug trafficking on the dark web, adding to a long list of  criminal enterprises  that have been shuttered in recent years. The effort, codenamed Operation SpecTor , also saw the authorities confiscating more than $53.4 million in cash and virtual currencies, 850 kg of drugs, and 117 firearms. The largest number of arrests were made in the U.S. (153), followed by the U.K. (55), Germany (52), the Netherlands (10), Austria (9), France (5), Switzerland (2), Poland (1), and Brazil (1). "This represents the most funds seized and the highest number of arrests in any coordinated international action," U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland  said . "The drug traffickers are confident that, by operating anonymously on the dark web, they can operate outside the bounds of the law. They are wrong." The arrests stem from evidence gathered after the  tak

Almost half of MSP clients fell victim to a cyberattack within the last 12 months. In the SMB world, the danger is especially acute as only 50% of SMBs have a dedicated internal IT person to take care of cybersecurity. No wonder cybercriminals are targeting SMBs so heavily. No wonder SMBs are increasingly willing to pay a subscription or retainer to gain access to expert C-level cyber-assistance in devising and implementing strategies to prevent breaches, reduce risk, and mitigate the consequences of attacks. Hence the popularity of Virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) services. They are especially attractive to MSPs and MSSPs as:  They enable service providers to address a growing need from their SMB clients for proactive cyber resilience  They offer the potential to grow recurring revenues - expand into a new customer base or sell a new service to existing customers They help service providers differentiate themselves They are an excellent vehicle from which to u

While these trackers are primarily designed to keep tabs on personal belongings like keys, wallets, luggage, and other items, such devices have also been abused by bad actors for  criminal or nefarious purposes , including instances of  stalking, harassment, and theft . The goal is to standardize the alerting mechanisms and minimize opportunities for misuse across Bluetooth location-tracking devices from different vendors.

Threat actors are actively exploiting an unpatched five-year-old flaw impacting TBK digital video recording (DVR) devices, according to an advisory issued by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs. The vulnerability in question is  CVE-2018-9995  (CVSS score: 9.8), a critical authentication bypass issue that could be exploited by remote actors to gain elevated permissions. "The 5-year-old vulnerability (CVE-2018-9995) is due to an error when handling a maliciously crafted HTTP cookie," Fortinet  said  in an outbreak alert on May 1, 2023. "A remote attacker may be able to exploit this flaw to bypass authentication and obtain administrative privileges eventually leading access to camera video feeds." The network security company said it observed over 50,000 attempts to exploit TBK DVR devices using the flaw in the month of April 2023. Despite the availability of a proof-of-concept ( PoC ) exploit, there are no fixes that address the vulnerability. The flaw impacts TBK DVR4104

Researchers Uncover New BGP Flaws in Popular Internet Routing Protocol Software<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/researchers-uncover-new-bgp-flaws-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered weaknesses in a software implementation of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that could be weaponized to achieve a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on vulnerable BGP peers. The three vulnerabilities reside in version 8.4 of  FRRouting , a popular open source internet routing protocol suite for Linux and Unix platforms. It's currently used by several vendors like  NVIDIA Cumulus ,  DENT , and  SONiC , posing supply chain risks. The discovery is the result of an analysis of seven different implementations of BGP carried out by Forescout Vedere Labs: FRRouting, BIRD, OpenBGPd, Mikrotik RouterOS, Juniper JunOS, Cisco IOS, and Arista EOS. BGP is a  gateway protocol  that's designed to exchange routing and reachability information between autonomous systems. It's used to find the most efficient routes for delivering internet traffic.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Android surveillanceware possibly used by the Iranian government has been used to spy on over 300 individuals belonging to minority groups. The malware, dubbed  BouldSpy , has been attributed with moderate confidence to the Law Enforcement Command of the Islamic Republic of Iran ( FARAJA ). Targeted victims include Iranian Kurds, Baluchis, Azeris, and Armenian Christian groups. "The spyware may also have been used in efforts to counter and monitor illegal trafficking activity related to arms, drugs, and alcohol," Lookout  said , based on exfiltrated data that contained photos of drugs, firearms, and official documents issued by FARAJA.  BouldSpy, like other Android malware families, abuses its access to Android's accessibility services and other intrusive permissions to harvest sensitive data such as web browser history, photos, contact lists, SMS logs, keystrokes, screenshots, clipboard content, microphone audio, and video call recordings.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The telecom industry has always been a tantalizing target for cybercriminals. The combination of interconnected networks, customer data, and sensitive information allows cybercriminals to inflict maximum damage through minimal effort. It's the breaches in telecom companies that tend to have a seismic impact and far-reaching implications — in addition to reputational damage, which can be difficult to measure, telecoms are often at the receiving end of government fines for their cybersecurity and privacy failures. There are few industries in the world that collect as much sensitive data as telecom companies. In recent years, telecom companies have accelerated their digital transformation, shedding legacy systems and reducing costs. These changes, coupled with the need for stronger collaboration with third-party vendors, have led them to SaaS applications to handle their CRM. Today, telecoms are using SaaS apps for billing, HR, call management, field operations management, tracking ca

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In yet another instance of how threat actors are abusing Google Ads to serve malware, a threat actor has been observed leveraging the technique to deliver a new Windows-based financial trojan and information stealer called LOBSHOT . "LOBSHOT continues to collect victims while staying under the radar," Elastic Security Labs researcher Daniel Stepanic said in an analysis published last week. "One of LOBSHOT's core capabilities is around its hVNC (Hidden Virtual Network Computing) component. These kinds of modules allow for direct and unobserved access to the machine." The American-Dutch company attributed the malware strain to a threat actor known as  TA505  based on infrastructure historically connected to the group. TA505 is a financially motivated e-crime syndicate that overlaps with  activity clusters  tracked under the names Evil Corp, FIN11, and Indrik Spider. The latest development is significant because it's a sign that TA505, which is associate

The North Korean threat actor known as  ScarCruft  started experimenting with oversized LNK files as a delivery route for RokRAT malware as early as July 2022, the same month Microsoft  began blocking macros  across Office documents by default. "RokRAT has not changed significantly over the years, but its deployment methods have evolved, now utilizing archives containing LNK files that initiate multi-stage infection chains," Check Point  said  in a new technical report. "This is another representation of a major trend in the threat landscape, where APTs and cybercriminals alike attempt to overcome the blocking of macros from untrusted sources." ScarCruft , also known by the names APT37, InkySquid, Nickel Foxcroft, Reaper, RedEyes, and Ricochet Chollima, is a threat group that almost exclusively targets South Korean individuals and entities as part of spear-phishing attacks designed to deliver an array of custom tools.

New Decoy Dog Malware Toolkit Uncovered: Targeting Enterprise Networks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/new-decoy-dog-malware-toolkit-uncovered.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of over 70 billion DNS records has led to the discovery of a new sophisticated malware toolkit dubbed  Decoy Dog  targeting enterprise networks. Decoy Dog , as the name implies, is evasive and employs techniques like strategic domain aging and DNS query dribbling, wherein a series of queries are transmitted to the command-and-control (C2) domains so as to not arouse any suspicion. "Decoy Dog is a cohesive toolkit with a number of highly unusual characteristics that make it uniquely identifiable, particularly when examining its domains on a DNS level," Infoblox  said  in an advisory published late last month. The cybersecurity firm, which identified the malware in early April 2023 following anomalous DNS beaconing activity, said its atypical characteristics allowed it to map additional domains that are part of the attack infrastructure. That said, the usage of Decoy Dog in the wild is "very rare," with the DNS signature matching less than 0.0000027%

Wanted Dead or Alive: Real-Time Protection Against Lateral Movement<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/wanted-dead-or-alive-real-time.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Just a few short years ago, lateral movement was a tactic confined to top APT cybercrime organizations and nation-state operators. Today, however, it has become a commoditized tool, well within the skillset of any ransomware threat actor. This makes real-time detection and prevention of lateral movement a necessity to organizations of all sizes and across all industries. But the disturbing truth is that there is actually no tool in the current security stack that can provide this real-time protection, creating what is arguably the most critical security weakness in an organization's security architecture.  In this article, we'll walk through the most essentials questions around the challenge of lateral movement protection, understand why multifactor authentication (MFA) and service account protection are the gaps that make it possible, and learn how Silverfort's platform turns the tables on attackers and makes lateral movement protection finally within reach.

Vietnamese Threat Actor Infects 500,000 Devices Using 'Malverposting' Tactics<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/vietnamese-threat-actor-infects-500000.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Vietnamese threat actor has been attributed as behind a "malverposting" campaign on social media platforms to infect over 500,000 devices worldwide over the past three months to deliver variants of information stealers such as  S1deload Stealer  and  SYS01stealer . Malverposting refers to the use of promoted social media posts on services like Facebook and Twitter to mass propagate malicious software and other security threats. The idea is to reach a broader audience by paying for ads to "amplify" their posts. According to  Guardio Labs , such attacks commence with the adversary creating new business profiles and hijacking already popular accounts to serve ads that claim to offer free adult-rated photo album downloads. Within these ZIP archive files are purported images that are actually executable files, which, when clicked, activate the infection chain and ultimately deploy the stealer malware to siphon session cookies, account data, and other information.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has warned of cyber attacks perpetrated by Russian nation-state hackers targeting various government bodies in the country. The agency  attributed  the phishing campaign to APT28, which is also known by the names Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard, FROZENLAKE, Iron Twilight, Sednit, and Sofacy. The email messages come with the subject line "Windows Update" and purportedly contain instructions in the Ukrainian language to run a PowerShell command under the pretext of security updates. Running the script loads and executes a next-stage PowerShell script that's designed to collect basic system information through commands like  tasklist  and  systeminfo , and exfiltrate the details via an HTTP request to a  Mocky API . To trick the targets into running the command, the emails impersonated system administrators of the targeted government entities using fake Microsoft Outlook email accounts created with the employees'

Google disclosed that its improved security features and app review processes helped it block 1.43 million bad apps from being published to the Play Store in 2022. In addition, the company said it banned 173,000 bad accounts and fended off over $2 billion in fraudulent and abusive transactions through  developer-facing features  like Voided Purchases API, Obfuscated Account ID, and Play Integrity API. The addition of identity verification methods such as phone number and email address to join Google Play contributed to a reduction in accounts used to publish apps that go against its policies, Google pointed out. The search behemoth further said it "prevented about 500K submitted apps from unnecessarily accessing sensitive permissions over the past 3 years." "In 2022, the  App Security Improvements program  helped developers fix ~500K security weaknesses affecting ~300K apps with a combined install base of approximately 250B installs," it  noted .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has released an Industrial Control Systems (ICS) medical advisory warning of a critical flaw impacting Illumina medical devices. The issues impact the Universal Copy Service (UCS) software in the Illumina MiSeqDx, NextSeq 550Dx, iScan, iSeq 100, MiniSeq, MiSeq, NextSeq 500, NextSeq 550, NextSeq 1000/2000, and NovaSeq 6000 DNA sequencing instruments. The most severe of the flaws, CVE-2023-1968 (CVSS score: 10.0), permits remote attackers to bind to exposed IP addresses, thereby making it possible to eavesdrop on network traffic and remotely transmit arbitrary commands. The second issue relates to a case of privilege misconfiguration (CVE-2023-1966, CVSS score: 7.4) that could enable a remote unauthenticated malicious actor to upload and execute code with elevated permissions. "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to take any action at the operating system level," CISA  sa

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has officially made a return to Italy after the company met the  data protection authority's demands  ahead of April 30, 2023, deadline. The development was  first reported  by the Associated Press. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman,  tweeted , "we're excited ChatGPT is available in [Italy] again!" The reinstatement comes following Garante's decision to  temporarily block  access to the popular AI chatbot service in Italy on March 31, 2023, over concerns that its practices are in violation of data protection laws in the region. Generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Google Bard primarily rely on huge amounts of information freely available on the internet as well as the data its users provide over the course of their interactions. OpenAI, which published a  new FAQ , said it filters and removes information such as hate speech, adult content, sites that primarily aggregate personal information, and spam. It also emphasized that

Threat actors are advertising a new information stealer for the Apple macOS operating system called  Atomic macOS Stealer  (or AMOS) on Telegram for $1,000 per month, joining the likes of  MacStealer . "The Atomic macOS Stealer can steal various types of information from the victim's machine, including Keychain passwords, complete system information, files from the desktop and documents folder, and even the macOS password," Cyble researchers  said  in a technical report. Among other features include its ability to extract data from web browsers and cryptocurrency wallets like Atomic, Binance, Coinomi, Electrum, and Exodus. Threat actors who purchase the stealer from its developers are also provided a ready-to-use web panel for managing the victims. The malware takes the form of an unsigned disk image file (Setup.dmg) that, when executed, urges the victim to enter their system password on a bogus prompt to escalate privileges and carry out its malicious activities --

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Stopping new and evasive threats is one of the greatest challenges in cybersecurity. This is among the biggest reasons why  attacks increased dramatically in the past year  yet again, despite the estimated $172 billion spent on global cybersecurity in 2022. Armed with cloud-based tools and backed by sophisticated affiliate networks, threat actors can develop new and evasive malware more quickly than organizations can update their protections.  Relying on malware signatures and blocklists against these rapidly changing attacks has become futile. As a result, the SOC toolkit now largely revolves around threat detection and investigation. If an attacker can bypass your initial blocks, you expect your tools to pick them up at some point in the attack chain. Every organization's digital architecture is now seeded with security controls that log anything potentially malicious. Security analysts pore through these logs and determine what to investigate further. Does this work? Let'

Networking equipment maker Zyxel has released patches for a critical security flaw in its firewall devices that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution on affected systems. The issue, tracked as  CVE-2023-28771 , is rated 9.8 on the CVSS scoring system. Researchers from TRAPA Security have been credited with reporting the flaw. "Improper error message handling in some firewall versions could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute some OS commands remotely by sending crafted packets to an affected device," Zyxel  said  in an advisory on April 25, 2023. Products impacted by the flaw are - ATP (versions ZLD V4.60 to V5.35, patched in ZLD V5.36) USG FLEX (versions ZLD V4.60 to V5.35, patched in ZLD V5.36) VPN (versions ZLD V4.60 to V5.35, patched in ZLD V5.36), and ZyWALL/USG (versions ZLD V4.60 to V4.73, patched in ZLD V4.73 Patch 1) Zyxel has also  addressed  a high-severity post-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting select firewa

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A significant number of victims in the consumer and enterprise sectors located across Australia, Japan, the U.S., and India have been affected by an evasive information-stealing malware called  ViperSoftX . ViperSoftX was first documented by Fortinet in 2020, with cybersecurity company Avast detailing a campaign in November 2022 that  leveraged  the malware to distribute a malicious Google Chrome extension capable of siphoning cryptocurrencies from wallet applications. Now a  new analysis  from Trend Micro has revealed the malware's adoption of "more sophisticated encryption and basic anti-analysis techniques, such as byte remapping and web browser communication blocking." The arrival vector of ViperSoftX is typically a software crack or a key generator (keygen), while also employing actual non-malicious software like multimedia editors and system cleaner apps as "carriers." One of the key steps performed by the malware before downloading a first-stage Po

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing  Magecart  campaign has attracted the attention of cybersecurity researchers for leveraging realistic-looking fake payment screens to capture sensitive data entered by unsuspecting users. "The threat actor used original logos from the compromised store and customized a web element known as a modal to perfectly hijack the checkout page," Jérôme Segura, director of threat intelligence at Malwarebytes,  said . "The remarkable thing here is that the skimmer looks more authentic than the original payment page." The term  Magecart  is a catch-all that refers to several cybercrime groups which employ online skimming techniques to steal personal data from websites – most commonly, customer details and payment information on e-commerce websites. The name originates from the groups' initial targeting of the Magento platform. According to  data  shared by Sansec, the first Magecart-like attacks were observed as early as 2010. As of 2022, more than 70,000 sto

South Korean education, construction, diplomatic, and political institutions are at the receiving end of new attacks perpetrated by a China-aligned threat actor known as the  Tonto Team . "Recent cases have revealed that the group is using a file related to anti-malware products to ultimately execute their malicious attacks," the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)  said  in a report published this week. Tonto Team, active since at least 2009, has a track record of targeting various sectors across Asia and Eastern Europe. Earlier this year, the group was  attributed  to an unsuccessful phishing attack on cybersecurity company Group-IB. The attack sequence discovered by ASEC starts with a Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (.CHM) file that executes a binary file to side-load a malicious DLL file (slc.dll) and launch  ReVBShell , an open source VBScript backdoor also put to use by another Chinese threat actor called  Tick .

Google Gets Court Order to Take Down CryptBot That Infected Over 670,000 Computers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/google-gets-court-order-to-take-down.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Wednesday said it obtained a temporary court order in the U.S. to disrupt the distribution of a Windows-based information-stealing malware called  CryptBot  and "decelerate" its growth. The tech giant's Mike Trinh and Pierre-Marc Bureau  said  the efforts are part of steps it takes to "not only hold criminal operators of malware accountable, but also those who profit from its distribution." CryptBot is estimated to have infected over 670,000 computers in 2022 with the goal of stealing sensitive data such as authentication credentials, social media account logins, and cryptocurrency wallets from users of Google Chrome. The harvested data is then exfiltrated to the threat actors, who then sell the data to other attackers for use in data breach campaigns. CryptBot was  first discovered  in the wild in December 2019. The malware has been traditionally delivered via maliciously modified versions of legitimate and popular software packages such as Goog

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A little-known Russian-speaking cyber-espionage group has been linked to a new politically-motivated surveillance campaign targeting high-ranking government officials, telecom services, and public service infrastructures in Tajikistan. The intrusion set, dubbed  Paperbug  by Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT, has been attributed to a threat actor known as  Nomadic Octopus  (aka DustSquad). "The types of compromised machines range from individuals' computers to [operational technology] devices," PRODAFT said in a deep dive technical report shared with The Hacker News. "These targets make operation 'Paperbug' intelligence-driven." The ultimate motive behind the attacks is unclear at this stage, but the cybersecurity firm has raised the possibility that it could be the work of opposition forces within the country or, alternatively, an intelligence-gathering mission carried out by Russia or China. Nomadic Octopus first came to light in October 2018 w

Remote Access Trojans (RATs) have taken the third leading position in ANY. RUN's  Q1 2023 report  on the most prevalent malware types, making it highly probable that your organization may face this threat. Though LimeRAT might not be the most well-known RAT family, its versatility is what sets it apart. Capable of carrying out a broad spectrum of malicious activities, it excels not only in data exfiltration, but also in creating DDoS botnets and facilitating crypto mining. Its compact footprint allows it to elude endpoint detection systems, making it a stealthy adversary. Interestingly, LimeRAT shares similarities with njRAT, which ANY.RUN ranks as the third most popular malware family in terms of uploads during Q1 2023. ANY.RUN researchers have recently conducted an in-depth analysis of a LimeRAT sample and successfully extracted its configuration. In this article, we'll provide a brief overview of that analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind  RTM Locker  have developed a ransomware strain that's capable of targeting Linux machines, marking the group's first foray into the open source operating system. "Its locker ransomware infects Linux, NAS, and ESXi hosts and appears to be inspired by  Babuk  ransomware's leaked source code," Uptycs said in a new report published Wednesday. "It uses a combination of  ECDH  on Curve25519 (asymmetric encryption) and  Chacha20  (symmetric encryption) to encrypt files." RTM Locker was  first documented  by Trellix earlier this month, describing the adversary as a private ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) provider. It has its roots in a cybercrime group called Read The Manual (RTM) that's known to be active since at least 2015. The group is notable for deliberately avoiding high-profile targets such as critical infrastructure, law enforcement, and hospitals so as to draw as little attention as possible. It also leverages affilia

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has confirmed that the  active exploitation of PaperCut servers  is linked to attacks that are designed to deliver Cl0p and LockBit ransomware families. The tech giant's threat intelligence team is attributing a subset of the intrusions to a financially motivated actor it tracks under the name  Lace Tempest  (formerly DEV-0950), which overlaps with other hacking groups like FIN11, TA505, and Evil Corp. "In observed attacks, Lace Tempest ran multiple PowerShell commands to deliver a TrueBot DLL, which connected to a C2 server, attempted to steal LSASS credentials, and injected the  TrueBot payload  into the conhost.exe service," Microsoft  said  in a series of tweets. The next phase of the attack entailed the deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon implant to conduct reconnaissance, move laterally across the network using WMI, and exfiltrate files of interest via the file-sharing service MegaSync.

The Chinese nation-state group dubbed  Alloy Taurus  is using a Linux variant of a backdoor called PingPull as well as a new undocumented tool codenamed Sword2033. That's according to findings from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, which  discovered  recent malicious cyber activity carried out by the group targeting South Africa and Nepal. Alloy Taurus is the constellation-themed moniker assigned to a threat actor that's known for its attacks targeting telecom companies since at least 2012. It's also tracked by Microsoft as Granite Typhoon (previously Gallium). Last month, the adversary was attributed to a campaign called  Tainted Love  targeting telecommunication providers in the Middle East as part of a broader operation referred to as Soft Cell. Recent cyber espionage attacks mounted by Alloy Taurus have also broadened their victimology footprint to include financial institutions and government entities.

The prolific Iranian nation-state group known as  Charming Kitten  is actively targeting multiple victims in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and India with a novel malware dubbed  BellaCiao , adding to its ever-expanding list of custom tools. Discovered by Bitdefender Labs, BellaCiao is a "personalized dropper" that's capable of delivering other malware payloads onto a victim machine based on commands received from an actor-controlled server. "Each sample collected was tied up to a specific victim and included hard-coded information such as company name, specially crafted subdomains, or associated public IP address," the Romanian cybersecurity firm  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. Charming Kitten, also known as APT35, Cobalt Illusion, Educated Manticore, ITG18, Mint Sandstorm (née Phosphorus), TA453, and Yellow Garuda, is an Iranian state-sponsored APT group associated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The advanced persistent threat (APT) group referred to as  Evasive Panda  has been observed targeting an international non-governmental organization (NGO) in Mainland China with malware delivered via update channels of legitimate applications like Tencent QQ. The attack chains are designed to distribute a Windows installer for MgBot malware, ESET security researcher Facundo Muñoz said in a new report published today. The activity commenced in November 2020 and continued throughout 2021. Evasive Panda, also known as Bronze Highland and Daggerfly, is a Chinese-speaking APT group that has been attributed to a series of  cyber espionage attacks  targeting various entities in China, Hong Kong, and other countries located in East and South Asia since at least late December 2012. The group's hallmark is the use of the custom MgBot modular malware framework, which is capable of receiving additional components on the fly to expand on its intelligence-gathering capabilities.

The maintainers of the  Apache Superset  open source data visualization software have released fixes to plug an insecure default configuration that could lead to remote code execution. The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2023-27524  (CVSS score: 8.9), impacts versions up to and including 2.0.1 and relates to the use of a default SECRET_KEY that could be abused by attackers to authenticate and access unauthorized resources on internet-exposed installations. Naveen Sunkavally, the chief architect at Horizon3.ai, described the issue as "a dangerous default configuration in Apache Superset that allows an unauth attacker to gain remote code execution, harvest credentials, and compromise data." It's worth noting that the flaw does not affect Superset instances that have changed the default value for the SECRET_KEY config to a more cryptographically secure random string. The cybersecurity firm, which found that the SECRET_KEY is defaulted to the value "\x02\x01thisismy

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware has released updates to resolve multiple security flaws impacting its Workstation and Fusion software, the most critical of which could allow a local attacker to achieve code execution. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-20869 (CVSS score: 9.3), is described as a stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability that resides in the functionality for sharing host Bluetooth devices with the virtual machine. "A malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may exploit this issue to execute code as the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host," the company  said . Also patched by VMware is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability affecting the same feature (CVE-2023-20870, CVSS score: 7.1), that could be abused by a local adversary with admin privileges to read sensitive information contained in hypervisor memory from a virtual machine.

An Iranian nation-state threat actor has been linked to a new wave of phishing attacks targeting Israel that's designed to deploy an updated version of a Windows backdoor called PowerLess . Cybersecurity firm Check Point is tracking the activity cluster under its mythical creature handle  Educated Manticore , which exhibits "strong overlaps" with a hacking crew known as APT35, Charming Kitten, Cobalt Illusion, ITG18, Mint Sandstorm (formerly Phosphorus), TA453, and Yellow Garuda. "Like many other actors, Educated Manticore has adopted recent trends and started using ISO images and possibly other archive files to initiate infection chains," the Israeli company  said  in a technical report published today. Active since at least 2011, APT35 has cast a  wide net of targets  by leveraging  fake social media personas ,  spear-phishing techniques , and  N-day vulnerabilities in internet-exposed applications  to gain initial access and drop various payloads, includi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Managing vulnerabilities in the constantly evolving technological landscape is a difficult task. Although vulnerabilities emerge regularly, not all vulnerabilities present the same level of risk. Traditional metrics such as CVSS score or the number of vulnerabilities are insufficient for effective vulnerability management as they lack business context, prioritization, and understanding of attackers' opportunities. Vulnerabilities only represent a small part of the attack surface that attackers can leverage. Initially, organizations used manual methods to address known security weaknesses, but as technology and cyber threats evolved, a more automated and comprehensive approach became necessary. However, legacy vulnerability management tools were designed primarily for compliance and modern tools still face challenges in prioritization and limited resources, especially in dynamic and agile cloud environments. Modern vulnerability management integrates security tools such as scanne

Russian Hackers Tomiris Targeting Central Asia for Intelligence Gathering<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/russian-hackers-tomiris-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Russian-speaking threat actor behind a backdoor known as Tomiris is primarily focused on gathering intelligence in Central Asia, fresh findings from Kaspersky reveal. "Tomiris's endgame consistently appears to be the regular theft of internal documents," security researchers Pierre Delcher and Ivan Kwiatkowski  said  in an analysis published today. "The threat actor targets government and diplomatic entities in the CIS." The Russian cybersecurity firm's latest assessment is based on three new attack campaigns mounted by the hacking crew between 2021 and 2023. Tomiris first came to light in September 2021 when Kaspersky  highlighted  its potential connections to  Nobelium  (aka APT29, Cozy Bear, or Midnight Blizzard), the Russian nation-state group behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack. Similarities have also been unearthed between the backdoor and another malware strain dubbed  Kazuar , which is attributed to the Turla group (aka Krypton, Secre

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are employing a previously undocumented "defense evasion tool" dubbed AuKill that's designed to disable endpoint detection and response (EDR) software by means of a Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver ( BYOVD ) attack. "The AuKill tool abuses an outdated version of the  driver  used by version 16.32 of the Microsoft utility,  Process Explorer , to disable EDR processes before deploying either a backdoor or ransomware on the target system," Sophos researcher Andreas Klopsch  said  in a report published last week. Incidents analyzed by the cybersecurity firm show the use of AuKill since the start of 2023 to deploy various ransomware strains such as Medusa Locker and LockBit. Six different versions of the malware have been identified to date. The oldest AuKill sample features a November 2022 compilation timestamp. The  BYOVD technique  relies on threat actors misusing a legitimate, but out-of-date and exploitable, driver signed by Microsoft (or usin

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recent review by Wing Security, a SaaS security company that analyzed the data of over 500 companies,  revealed some worrisome information . According to this review, 84% of the companies had employees using an average of 3.5 SaaS applications that were breached in the previous 3 months. While this is concerning, it isn't much of a surprise. The exponential growth in SaaS usage has security and IT teams struggling to keep up with which SaaS applications are being used and how. This isn't to say that SaaS should be avoided or blocked; on the contrary, SaaS applications must be used to ensure business growth. But using them has to be done with some level of caution. Determining which SaaS applications are risky The most intuitive risk factor to determining whether an application is risky is looking it up and seeing if it has been breached. SaaS applications are clearly a target as we see more and more SaaS related attacks. A breach is a clear indication to stay away, at leas

Threat actors have been observed leveraging a legitimate but outdated WordPress plugin to surreptitiously backdoor websites as part of an ongoing campaign, Sucuri  revealed  in a report published last week. The plugin in question is Eval PHP, released by a developer named flashpixx. It allows users to insert PHP code pages and posts of WordPress sites that's then executed every time the posts are opened in a web browser. While  Eval PHP  has never received an update in 11 years, statistics gathered by WordPress show that it's installed on over 8,000 websites, with the number of downloads skyrocketing from one or two on average since September 2022 to 6,988 on March 30, 2023. On April 23, 2023, alone, it was downloaded 2,140 times. The plugin has racked up 23,110 downloads over the past seven days. GoDaddy-owned Sucuri said it observed some infected websites' databases injected with malicious code into the  "wp_posts" table , which stores a site's  posts,

A new "all-in-one" stealer malware named  EvilExtractor  (also spelled Evil Extractor) is being marketed for sale for other threat actors to steal data and files from Windows systems. "It includes several modules that all work via an FTP service," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin  said . "It also contains environment checking and Anti-VM functions. Its primary purpose seems to be to steal browser data and information from compromised endpoints and then upload it to the attacker's FTP server." The network security company said it observed a surge in attacks spreading the malware in the wild in March 2023, with a majority of the victims located in Europe and the U.S. While marketed as an educational tool, EvilExtractor has been adopted by threat actors for use as an information stealer. The attack tool is being sold by an actor named Kodex on cybercrime forums like Cracked dating back to October 22, 2022. It's continually updated and

Lazarus X_TRADER Hack Impacts Critical Infrastructure Beyond 3CX Breach<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/lazarus-xtrader-hack-impacts-critical.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Lazarus, the prolific North Korean hacking group behind the cascading  supply chain attack targeting 3CX , also breached two critical infrastructure organizations in the power and energy sector and two other businesses involved in financial trading using the trojanized X_TRADER application. The new findings, which come courtesy of  Symantec's Threat Hunter Team , confirm earlier suspicions that the X_TRADER application compromise affected more organizations than 3CX. The names of the organizations were not revealed. Eric Chien, director of security response at Broadcom-owned Symantec, told The Hacker News in a statement that the attacks took place between September 2022 and November 2022. "The impact from these infections is unknown at this time – more investigation is required and is on-going," Chien said, adding it's possible that there's "likely more to this story and possibly even other packages that are trojanized."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A large-scale attack campaign discovered in the wild has been exploiting Kubernetes (K8s) Role-Based Access Control ( RBAC ) to create backdoors and run cryptocurrency miners. "The attackers also deployed DaemonSets to take over and hijack resources of the K8s clusters they attack," cloud security firm Aqua said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The Israeli company, which dubbed the attack  RBAC Buster , said it found 60 exposed K8s clusters that have been exploited by the threat actor behind this campaign. The attack chain commenced with the attacker gaining initial access via a misconfigured API server, followed by checking for evidence of competing miner malware on the compromised server and then using RBAC to set up persistence. "The attacker created a new ClusterRole with near admin-level privileges," the company said. "Next, the attacker created a 'ServiceAccount', 'kube-controller' in the 'kube-system' namespace. Last

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a now-patched zero-day flaw in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that could have enabled threat actors to conceal an unremovable, malicious application inside a victim's Google account. Dubbed GhostToken by Israeli cybersecurity startup Astrix Security, the shortcoming impacts all Google accounts, including enterprise-focused Workspace accounts. It was discovered and reported to Google on June 19, 2022. The company deployed a global-patch more than nine months later on April 7, 2023. "The vulnerability [...] allows attackers to gain permanent and unremovable access to a victim's Google account by converting an already authorized third-party application into a malicious trojan app, leaving the victim's personal data exposed forever," Astrix  said  in a report.

The supply chain attack targeting 3CX was the result of a prior supply chain compromise associated with a different company, demonstrating a new level of sophistication with North Korean threat actors.

The Matryoshka doll-style cascading attack against 3CX first came to light on March 29, 2023, when it  emerged  that Windows and macOS versions of its communication software were trojanized to deliver a C/C++-based data miner named ICONIC Stealer by means of a downloader, SUDDENICON, that used icon files hosted on GitHub to extract the server containing the stealer.

Cisco and VMware have released security updates to address critical security flaws in their products that could be exploited by malicious actors to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. The most severe of the vulnerabilities is a command injection flaw  in Cisco Industrial Network Director  (CVE-2023-20036, CVSS score: 9.9), which resides in the web UI component and arises as a result of improper input validation when  uploading a Device Pack . "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM on the underlying operating system of an affected device," Cisco  said  in an advisory released on April 19, 2023. The networking equipment major also resolved a medium-severity file permissions vulnerability in the same product (CVE-2023-20039, CVSS score: 5.5) that an authenticated, local attacker could abuse to view sensitive information.

Why is Visibility into OT Environments Crucial? The significance of Operational Technology (OT) for businesses is undeniable as the OT sector flourishes alongside the already thriving IT sector. OT includes industrial control systems, manufacturing equipment, and devices that oversee and manage industrial environments and critical infrastructures. In recent years, adversaries have recognized the lack of detection and protection in many industrial systems and are actively exploiting these vulnerabilities. In response, IT security leaders have become more aware of the need to protect their OT environments with security monitoring and response capabilities. This development was accelerated by severe past cyber incidents targeting critical OT environments and even causing physical damage to infrastructures. Given the pivotal role these systems play in business operations and modern society, ensuring their security is of utmost importance. The underlying trend is clear: OT and IoT networ

The notorious North Korea-aligned state-sponsored actor known as the  Lazarus Group  has been attributed to a new campaign aimed at Linux users. The attacks are part of a persistent and long-running activity tracked under the name  Operation Dream Job , ESET said in a  new report  published today. The findings are crucial, not least because it marks the first publicly documented example of the adversary using Linux malware as part of this social engineering scheme. Operation Dream Job , also known as  DeathNote or NukeSped , refers to multiple attack waves wherein the group leverages fraudulent job offers as a lure to trick unsuspecting targets into downloading malware. It also  exhibits overlaps  with two other Lazarus clusters known as Operation In(ter)ception and Operation North Star. The attack chain discovered by ESET is no different in that it delivers a fake HSBC job offer as a decoy within a ZIP archive file that's then used to launch a Linux backdoor named SimplexTea

Fortra, the company behind Cobalt Strike, shed light on a zero-day remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in its GoAnywhere MFT tool that has come under  active   exploitation  by ransomware actors to steal sensitive data. The high-severity flaw, tracked as  CVE-2023-0669  (CVSS score: 7.2), concerns a case of pre-authenticated command injection that could be abused to achieve code execution. The issue was patched by the company in version 7.1.2 of the software in February 2023, but not before it was weaponized as a zero-day since January 18. Fortra, which worked with Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, said it was made aware of suspicious activity associated with some of the file transfer instances on January 30, 2023. "The unauthorized party used CVE-2023-0669 to create unauthorized user accounts in some MFTaaS customer environments," the company  said .

In the short time since their inception, ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms have rightfully gained the reputation of ultimate productivity boosters. However, the very same technology that enables rapid production of high-quality text on demand, can at the same time expose sensitive corporate data. A recent  incident , in which Samsung software engineers pasted proprietary code into ChatGPT, clearly demonstrates that this tool can easily become a potential data leakage channel. This vulnerability introduces a demanding challenge for security stakeholders, since none of the existing data protection tools can ensure no sensitive data is exposed to ChatGPT. In this article we'll explore this security challenge in detail and show how browser security solutions can provide a solution. All while enabling organizations to fully realize ChatGPT's productivity potential and without having to compromise on data security.  The ChatGPT data protection blind spot: How can you govern

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Telecommunication services providers in Africa are the target of a new campaign orchestrated by a China-linked threat actor at least since November 2022. The intrusions have been pinned on a hacking crew tracked by Symantec as  Daggerfly , and which is also tracked by the broader cybersecurity community as Bronze Highland and Evasive Panda. The campaign makes use of "previously unseen plugins from the MgBot malware framework," the cybersecurity company  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The attackers were also seen using a  PlugX loader  and abusing the legitimate AnyDesk remote desktop software." Daggerfly's use of the  MgBot loader  (aka BLame or MgmBot) was  spotlighted  by Malwarebytes in July 2020 as part of phishing attacks aimed at Indian government personnel and individuals in Hong Kong. According to a profile published by Secureworks, the threat actor uses spear-phishing as an initial infection vector to drop MgBot as well as other

Israeli spyware maker NSO Group deployed at least three novel "zero-click" exploits against iPhones in 2022 to infiltrate defenses erected by Apple and deploy Pegasus, according to the latest findings from Citizen Lab. "NSO Group customers widely deployed at least three iOS 15 and iOS 16 zero-click exploit chains against civil society targets around the world," the interdisciplinary laboratory based at the University of Toronto  said . NSO Group is the manufacturer of  Pegasus , a sophisticated cyber weapon that's capable of extracting sensitive information stored in a device – e.g., messages, locations, photos, and call logs, among others — in real-time. It's typically delivered to targeted iPhones using zero-click and/or zero-day exploits.

Elite hackers associated with  Russia's military intelligence service  have been linked to large-volume phishing campaigns aimed at hundreds of users in Ukraine to extract intelligence and influence public discourse related to the war. Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), which is  monitoring  the activities of the actor under the name  FROZENLAKE , said the  attacks   continue  the "group's 2022 focus on targeting webmail users in Eastern Europe." The state-sponsored cyber actor, also tracked as APT28, Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard, Iron Twilight, Sednit, and Sofacy, is both highly active and proficient. It has been active since at least 2009, targeting media, governments, and military entities for espionage. The latest intrusion set, starting in early February 2023, involved the use of reflected cross-site scripting ( XSS ) attacks in various Ukrainian government websites to redirect users to phishing domains and capture their credentials.

"The group is known for using a variety of sophisticated attack techniques, including custom malware, social engineering tactics, and spear-phishing attacks," ThreatMon  said  in a Tuesday report. Blind Eagle, also referred to as APT-C-36, is a suspected Spanish-speaking group that chiefly strikes private and public sector entities in Colombian. Attacks orchestrated by the group have also targeted Ecuador, Chile, and Spain. Infection chains documented by  Check Point  and  BlackBerry  this year have revealed the use of spear-phishing lures to deliver commodity malware families like BitRAT, AsyncRAT, and in-memory Python loaders capable of launching a Meterpreter payload. The latest discovery from ThreatMon entails the use of a JavaScript downloader to execute a PowerShell script hosted

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday rolled out emergency fixes to address another actively exploited high-severity zero-day flaw in its Chrome web browser. The flaw, tracked as  CVE-2023-2136 , is  described  as a case of  integer overflow  in  Skia , an open source 2D graphics library. Clément Lecigne of Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on April 12, 2023. "Integer overflow in Skia in Google Chrome prior to 112.0.5615.137 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page,"  according  to the NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The tech giant, which also fixed seven other security issues with the latest update, said it's aware of active exploitation of the flaw, but did not disclose additional details to prevent further abuse. The development marks the second Chrome zero-day vulnerability to be exploited by malicious actors th

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Recent data breaches across CircleCI, LastPass, and Okta underscore a common theme: The enterprise SaaS stacks connected to these industry-leading apps can be at serious risk for compromise. CircleCI, for example, plays an integral, SaaS-to-SaaS role for SaaS app development. Similarly, tens of thousands of organizations rely on Okta and LastPass security roles for SaaS identity and access management. Enterprise and niche SaaS apps alike have effectively introduced multitudes of unmonitored endpoints into organizations of all sizes.  While  spending for SaaS security  is trending up, it lags behind categories such as cloud infrastructure protection and network security. According to Statista, the average organization employs 100+ SaaS apps, many of which are unsanctioned by IT, creating a glaring gap in SaaS security.  Why Users Flock to SaaS Apps — And Often Bypass IT in the Process As productivity tools for tasks such as marketing automation, document signature, and sales foreca

The Pakistan-based advanced persistent threat (APT) actor known as  Transparent Tribe  used a two-factor authentication (2FA) tool used by Indian government agencies as a ruse to deliver a new Linux backdoor called Poseidon. "Poseidon is a second-stage payload malware associated with Transparent Tribe," Uptycs security researcher Tejaswini Sandapolla said in a technical report published this week. "It is a general-purpose backdoor that provides attackers with a wide range of capabilities to hijack an infected host. Its functionalities include logging keystrokes, taking screen captures, uploading and downloading files, and remotely administering the system in various ways." Transparent Tribe  is also tracked as APT36, Operation C-Major, PROJECTM, and Mythic Leopard, and has a track record of targeting Indian government organizations, military personnel, defense contractors, and educational entities.

U.K. and U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have  warned  of Russian nation-state actors exploiting now-patched flaws in networking equipment from Cisco to conduct reconnaissance and deploy malware against targets. The  intrusions , per the authorities, took place in 2021 and targeted a small number of entities in Europe, U.S. government institutions, and about 250 Ukrainian victims. The activity has been attributed to a threat actor tracked as  APT28 , which is also known as Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard (formerly Strontium), FROZENLAKE, and Sofacy, and is affiliated with the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). "APT28 has been known to access vulnerable routers by using default and weak SNMP community strings, and by exploiting CVE-2017-6742," the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said. CVE-2017-6742  (CVSS score: 8.8) is part of a set of remote code execution flaws that stem from a  buffer overflow condition  in the Simple Network Ma

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Iranian government-backed actor known as  Mint Sandstorm  has been linked to attacks aimed at critical infrastructure in the U.S. between late 2021 to mid-2022. "This Mint Sandstorm subgroup is technically and operationally mature, capable of developing bespoke tooling and quickly weaponizing N-day vulnerabilities, and has demonstrated agility in its operational focus, which appears to align with Iran's national priorities," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team  said  in an analysis. Targeted entities consist of seaports, energy companies, transit systems, and a major U.S. utility and gas company. The activity is suspected to be retaliatory and in response to attacks targeting its maritime,  railway , and  gas station payment systems  that took place between May 2020 and late 2021. It's worth noting here that Iran subsequently  accused  Israel and the U.S. of masterminding the attacks on the gas stations in a bid to create unrest in the nation. Mint Sandsto

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A fresh round of patches has been made available for the vm2 JavaScript library to address two critical flaws that could be exploited to break out of the sandbox protections. Both the flaws –  CVE-2023-29199  and  CVE-2023-30547  – are rated 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS scoring system and have been addressed in versions 3.9.16 and 3.9.17, respectively. Successful  exploitation  of the  bugs , which allow an attacker to raise an unsanitized host exception, could be weaponized to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code in the host context. "A threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox," the maintainers of the vm2 library said in an alert. Credited with discovering and reporting the vulnerabilities is security researcher  SeungHyun Lee , who has also  released   proof-of-concept  (PoC) exploits for the two issues in question. The disclosure comes a little over a week after vm2 remediated another sand

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the inner workings of a highly evasive loader named " in2al5d p3in4er " (read: invalid printer) that's used to deliver the Aurora information stealer malware. "The in2al5d p3in4er loader is compiled with  Embarcadero RAD Studio  and targets endpoint workstations using advanced anti-VM (virtual machine) technique," cybersecurity firm Morphisec  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. Aurora  is a Go-based information stealer that emerged on the threat landscape in late 2022. Offered as a commodity malware to other actors, it's distributed through  YouTube videos  and SEO-poised fake cracked software download websites. Clicking the links present in YouTube video descriptions redirects the victim to decoy websites where they are enticed into downloading the malware under the garb of a seemingly-legitimate utility.

A new Android malware strain named  Goldoson  has been detected in the official Google Play Store spanning more than 60 legitimate apps that collectively have over 100 million downloads. An additional eight million installations have been tracked through ONE store, a leading third-party app storefront in South Korea. The rogue component is part of a third-party software library used by the apps in question and is capable of gathering information about installed apps, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-connected devices, and GPS locations. "Moreover, the library is armed with the functionality to perform ad fraud by clicking advertisements in the background without the user's consent," McAfee security researcher SangRyol Ryu  said  in a report published last week. What's more, it includes the ability to stealthily load web pages, a feature that could be abused to load ads for financial profit. It achieves this by loading HTML code in a hidden  WebView  and driving traffic to th

Rapid technological evolution requires security that is resilient, up to date and adaptable. In this article, we will cover the transformation in the field of DFIR (digital forensics and incident response) in the last couple years, focusing on the digital forensics' aspect and how XDR fits into the picture. Before we dive into the details, let's first break down the main components of DFIR and define the differences between them. Digital Forensics vs Incident Response Digital forensics:  the practice of using scientific techniques and tools to identify, preserve, and analyze digital evidence from various sources, such as computers, smartphones, and other electronic devices, in a way that is admissible in a court of law. Incident response:  the process of responding to and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack. This involves identifying the nature and scope of the incident, containing the damage, eradicating the threat, and restoring the affected syst

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian threat actor known as MuddyWater is continuing its time-tested tradition of relying on legitimate remote administration tools to commandeer targeted systems. While the nation-state group has previously employed  ScreenConnect, RemoteUtilities, and Syncro , a  new analysis  from Group-IB has revealed the adversary's use of the SimpleHelp remote support software in June 2022. MuddyWater, active since at least 2017, is assessed to be a subordinate element within Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). Some of the top targets include Turkey, Pakistan, the U.A.E., Iraq, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the U.S., Azerbaijan, and Afghanistan. "MuddyWater uses SimpleHelp, a legitimate remote device control and management tool, to ensure persistence on victim devices," Nikita Rostovtsev, senior threat analyst at Group-IB, said. "SimpleHelp is not compromised and is used as intended. The threat actors found a way to download the tool from the of

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors behind the LockBit ransomware operation have developed new artifacts that can encrypt files on devices running Apple's macOS operating system. The development, which was  reported  by the MalwareHunterTeam over the weekend, appears to be the first time a big-game ransomware crew has created a macOS-based payload. Additional samples identified by  vx-underground  show that the macOS variant has been available since November 11, 2022, and has managed to evade detection by anti-malware engines until now. LockBit is a  prolific cybercrime crew  with ties to Russia that has been active since late 2019, with the threat actors releasing two major updates to the locker in 2021 and 2022. According to statistics  released by Malwarebytes  last week, LockBit emerged as the second most used ransomware in March 2023 after Cl0p, accounting for 93 successful attacks. An analysis of the new macOS version ("locker_Apple_M1_64"_ reveals that it's still a work in pr

The company's board of directors are looking to sell off its intellectual property, the report further added. News of the purported shutdown comes as the firm's spyware framework – dubbed REIGN – was outed as  having been used  against journalists, political opposition figures, and NGO workers across North America, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.

A new strain of malware developed by threat actors likely affiliated with the FIN7 cybercrime group has been put to use by the members of the now-defunct Conti ransomware gang, indicating collaboration between the two crews.

"Former members of the  TrickBot/Conti syndicate  [...] have been using Domino since at least late February 2023 to deliver either the Project Nemesis information stealer or more capable backdoors such as Cobalt Strike," IBM Security X-Force security researcher Charlotte Hammond  said  in a report published last week.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and  SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM)  are frequently confused. The similarity of the acronyms notwithstanding, both security solutions focus on securing data in the cloud. In a world where the terms cloud and SaaS are used interchangeably, this confusion is understandable. This confusion, though, is dangerous to organizations that need to secure data that exists within cloud infrastructures like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as data within SaaS applications like Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Jira, Zoom, Slack and more. Assuming that either your CSPM or SSPM will secure your company resources that live off-premises is misplaced trust in a security tool that was only designed to secure either your cloud or your SaaS stack.  It's absolutely vital for decision makers to understand the difference between CSPM and SSPM, the value derived from each solution, and that both complement each other.

A Chinese nation-state group targeted an unnamed Taiwanese media organization to deliver an open source red teaming tool known as Google Command and Control ( GC2 ) amid broader abuse of Google's infrastructure for malicious ends. The tech giant's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) attributed the campaign to a threat actor it tracks under the  geological  and  geographical-themed  moniker  HOODOO , which is also known by the names  APT41 , Barium, Bronze Atlas, Wicked Panda, and  Winnti . The starting point of the attack is a phishing email that contains links to a password-protected file hosted on Google Drive, which, in turn, incorporates the GC2 tool to read commands from Google Sheets and exfiltrate data using the cloud storage service. "After installation on the victim machine, the malware queries Google Sheets to obtain attacker commands," Google's cloud division  said  in its sixth Threat Horizons Report.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the Vice Society ransomware gang have been observed using a bespoke PowerShell-based tool to fly under the radar and automate the process of exfiltrating data from compromised networks. "Threat actors (TAs) using built-in  data exfiltration   methods  like [living off the land binaries and scripts] negate the need to bring in external tools that might be flagged by security software and/or human-based security detection mechanisms," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researcher Ryan Chapman  said . "These methods can also hide within the general operating environment, providing subversion to the threat actor." Vice Society , tracked by Microsoft under the name DEV-0832, is an extortion-focused hacking group that emerged on the scene in May 2021. It's known to rely on ransomware binaries sold on the criminal underground to meet its goals. In December 2022, SentinelOne detailed the group's use of a ransomware variant, dubbed  PolyVi

A novel credential-stealing malware called  Zaraza bot  is being offered for sale on Telegram while also using the  popular   messaging service  as a command-and-control (C2). "Zaraza bot targets a large number of web browsers and is being actively distributed on a Russian Telegram hacker channel popular with threat actors," cybersecurity company Uptycs  said  in a report published last week. "Once the malware infects a victim's computer, it retrieves sensitive data and sends it to a Telegram server where the attackers can access it immediately." A 64-bit binary file compiled using C#, Zaraza bot is designed to target as many as 38 different web browsers, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, AVG Browser, Brave, Vivaldi, and Yandex. It's also equipped to capture screenshots of the active window. It's the latest example of malware that's capable of capturing login credentials associated with online bank accounts, cryptocurrency wallets

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Friday released out-of-band updates to resolve an actively exploited zero-day flaw in its Chrome web browser, making it the first such bug to be addressed since the start of the year. Tracked as  CVE-2023-2033 , the high-severity vulnerability has been described as a  type confusion issue  in the V8 JavaScript engine. Clement Lecigne of Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been credited with reporting the issue on April 11, 2023. "Type confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 112.0.5615.121 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page,"  according  to the NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The tech giant  acknowledged  that "an exploit for CVE-2023-2033 exists in the wild," but stopped short of sharing additional technical specifics or indicators of compromise (IoCs) to prevent further exploitation by threat actors. CVE-2023-2033 also appears to share similarities with  CVE-2022-1096

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Russia-linked  APT29  (aka Cozy Bear) threat actor has been attributed to an ongoing cyber espionage campaign targeting foreign ministries and diplomatic entities located in NATO member states, the European Union, and Africa. According to Poland's Military Counterintelligence Service and the CERT Polska team, the observed activity shares tactical overlaps with a cluster tracked by Microsoft as  Nobelium , which is known for its high-profile  attack on SolarWinds  in 2020. Nobelium's operations have been attributed to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ), an organization that's tasked with protecting "individuals, society, and the state from foreign threats." That said, the campaign represents an evolution of the Kremlin-backed hacking group's tactics, indicating  persistent attempts  at improving its cyber weaponry to infiltrate victim systems for intelligence gathering.

Open source media player software provider Kodi has confirmed a data breach after threat actors stole the company's MyBB forum database containing user data and private messages. What's more, the unknown threat actors  attempted to sell  the data dump  comprising 400,635 Kodi users  on the now-defunct  BreachForums  cybercrime marketplace. "MyBB admin logs show the account of a trusted but currently inactive member of the forum admin team was used to access the web-based MyBB admin console twice: on 16 February and again on 21 February," Kodi  said  in an advisory. The threat actors then abused the account to create database backups that were then downloaded and deleted. Also downloaded were existing nightly full backups of the database. The account in question has now been disabled. The nightly backups contained all public forum posts, team forum posts, messages sent through the user-to-user messaging system, and user information such as forum username, email a

Google on Thursday outlined a set of initiatives aimed at improving the vulnerability management ecosystem and establishing greater transparency measures around exploitation. "While the notoriety of zero-day vulnerabilities typically makes headlines, risks remain even after they're known and fixed, which is the real story," the company said in an announcement. "Those risks span everything from lag time in OEM adoption, patch testing pain points, end user update issues and more." Security threats also stem from incomplete patches applied by vendors, with a chunk of the zero-days exploited in the wild turning out to be variants of previously patched vulnerabilities. Mitigating such risks requires addressing the root cause of the vulnerabilities and prioritizing modern secure software development practices to eliminate entire classes of threats and block potential attack avenues. Taking these factors into consideration, Google said it's forming a Hacking

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the tactics of a "rising" cybercriminal gang called "Read The Manual" (RTM) Locker that functions as a private ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) provider and carries out opportunistic attacks to generate illicit profit. "The 'Read The Manual' Locker gang uses affiliates to ransom victims, all of whom are forced to abide by the gang's strict rules," cybersecurity firm Trellix said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The business-like set up of the group, where affiliates are required to remain active or notify the gang of their leave, shows the organizational maturity of the group, as has also been observed in other groups, such as  Conti ." RTM , first documented by ESET in February 2017,  started off  in 2015 as a banking malware targeting businesses in Russia via drive-by downloads, spam, and phishing emails.

WhatsApp Introduces New Device Verification Feature to Prevent Account Takeover Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/whatsapp-introduces-new-device.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Popular instant messaging app WhatsApp on Thursday announced a new account verification feature that ensures that malware running on a user's mobile device doesn't impact their account. "Mobile device malware is one of the biggest threats to people's privacy and security today because it can take advantage of your phone without your permission and use your WhatsApp to send unwanted messages," the Meta-owned company said in an announcement. Called  Device Verification , the security measure is designed to help prevent account takeover (ATO) attacks by blocking the threat actor's connection and allowing targets of the malware infection to use the app without any interruption. In other words, the goal is to deter attackers' use of malware to steal WhatsApp authentication keys and hijack victim accounts, and subsequently impersonate them to distribute spam and phishing links to other contacts. This, in turn, is achieved by introducing a security-token th

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An emerging Python-based credential harvester and a hacking tool named Legion is being marketed via Telegram as a way for threat actors to break into various online services for further exploitation. Legion, according to  Cado Labs , includes modules to enumerate vulnerable SMTP servers, conduct remote code execution (RCE) attacks, exploit unpatched versions of Apache, and brute-force cPanel and WebHost Manager (WHM) accounts. The malware is said to bear similarities to another malware family called AndroxGh0st that was first documented by cloud security services provider Lacework in December 2022. Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, in an analysis published late last month, revealed that AndroxGh0st is part of a comprehensive toolset called AlienFox that's offered to threat actors to steal API keys and secrets from cloud services.

The  Transparent Tribe  threat actor has been linked to a set of weaponized Microsoft Office documents in intrusions directed against the Indian education sector to deploy a continuously maintained piece of malware called Crimson RAT.

The hacking group, also called APT36, Operation C-Major, PROJECTM, and Mythic Leopard, has been active as far back as 2013. Educational institutions have been at the receiving end of the adversary's attacks since late 2021. "Crimson RAT is a  consistent   staple  in the group's  malware arsenal  the adversary uses in its campaigns," SentinelOne researcher Aleksandar Milenkoski  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Shadow APIs are a growing risk for organizations of all sizes as they can mask malicious behavior and induce substantial data loss. For those that aren't familiar with the term, shadow APIs are a type of application programming interface (API) that isn't officially documented or supported.  Contrary to popular belief, it's unfortunately all too common to have APIs in production that no one on your operations or security teams knows about. Enterprises manage thousands of APIs, many of which are not routed through a proxy such as an API gateway or web application firewall. This means they aren't monitored, are rarely audited, and are most vulnerable.  Since they aren't visible to security teams, shadow APIs provide hackers with a defenseless path to exploit vulnerabilities. These APIs can potentially be manipulated by malicious actors to gain access to a range of sensitive information, from customer addresses to company financial records. Considering the potential

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korean threat actor known as the Lazarus Group has been observed shifting its focus and rapidly evolving its tools and tactics as part of a long-running campaign called  DeathNote . While the nation-state adversary is known for persistently singling out the cryptocurrency sector, recent attacks have also targeted automotive, academic, and defense sectors in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world, in what's perceived as a "significant" pivot.  "At this point, the actor switched all the decoy documents to job descriptions related to defense contractors and diplomatic services," Kaspersky researcher Seongsu Park  said  in an analysis published Wednesday. The deviation in targeting, along with the use of updated infection vectors, is said to have occurred in April 2020. It's worth noting that the DeathNote cluster is also tracked under the monikers  Operation Dream Job  or  NukeSped . Google-owned Mandiant has also tied a subset of the activit

OpenAI, the company behind the massively popular ChatGPT AI chatbot, has launched a  bug bounty program  in an attempt to ensure its systems are "safe and secure." To that end, it has partnered with the crowdsourced security platform  Bugcrowd  for independent researchers to report vulnerabilities discovered in its product in exchange for rewards ranging from "$200 for low-severity findings to up to $20,000 for exceptional discoveries." It's worth noting that the program does not cover  model safety or hallucination issues , wherein the chatbot is prompted to generate malicious code or other faulty outputs. The company noted that "addressing these issues often involves substantial research and a broader approach." Other prohibited categories are denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, brute-forcing OpenAI APIs, and demonstrations that aim to destroy data or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information beyond what's necessary to highlight the prob

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors using hacking tools from an Israeli surveillanceware vendor named QuaDream targeted at least five members of civil society in North America, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. According to findings from a group of researchers from the Citizen Lab, the spyware campaign was directed against journalists, political opposition figures, and an NGO worker in 2021. The names of the victims were not disclosed. It's also suspected that the company abused a zero-click exploit dubbed  ENDOFDAYS  in iOS 14 to deploy spyware as a zero-day in version 14.4 and 14.4.2. There is no evidence that the exploit has been used after March 2021. ENDOFDAYS "appears to make use of invisible iCloud calendar invitations sent from the spyware's operator to victims," the researchers said , adding the .ics files contain invites to two backdated and overlapping events so as to not alert the users.  The attacks are suspected to have leveraged a quirk in iOS 1

And the hardest is probably: 'If any of your service account was compromised and used to access resources would you be able to detect and stop that in real-time?'.  Since most identity and security teams would provide a negative reply, it's no wonder that  one of the immediate actions today's attackers are doing following an initial endpoint compromised is hunting down unwatched service accounts.  And it's even less of a wonder that in most cases, they would succeed in finding one and leveraging it to spread within the entire environment, getting noticed only when it's too late – after workstations and server got encrypted by ransomware or sensitive data was stolen.  In this article, we unfold the reasons that have caused service accounts to become one of the most dangerous weaknesse

North Korean Hackers Uncovered as Mastermind in 3CX Supply Chain Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/lazarus-sub-group-labyrinth-chollima.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Enterprise communications service provider 3CX confirmed that the  supply chain attack  targeting its desktop application for Windows and macOS was the handiwork of a threat actor with North Korean nexus. The findings are the result of an interim assessment conducted by Google-owned Mandiant, whose services were enlisted after the intrusion came to light late last month. The threat intelligence and incident response unit is tracking the activity under its uncategorized moniker  UNC4736 . It's worth noting that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has attributed the attack to a Lazarus sub-group dubbed Labyrinth Chollima, citing tactical overlaps. The  attack chain , based on analyses from multiple security vendors, entailed the use of DLL side-loading techniques to load an information stealer known as ICONIC Stealer, followed by a second-stage called  Gopuram  in selective attacks aimed at crypto companies. Mandiant's forensic investigation has now revealed that the threat acto

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A "by-design flaw" uncovered in Microsoft Azure could be exploited by attackers to gain access to storage accounts, move laterally in the environment, and even execute remote code. "It is possible to abuse and leverage Microsoft Storage Accounts by manipulating Azure Functions to steal access-tokens of higher privilege identities, move laterally, potentially access critical business assets, and execute remote code (RCE)," Orca said in a new  report  shared with The Hacker News. The exploitation path that underpins this attack is a mechanism called  Shared Key authorization , which is enabled by default on storage accounts. According to Microsoft, Azure generates two 512-bit storage account access keys when creating a storage account. These keys can be used to authorize access to data via Shared Key authorization, or via SAS tokens that are signed with the shared key. "Storage account access keys provide full access to the configuration of a storage accoun

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious loader programs capable of trojanizing Android applications are being traded on the criminal underground for up to $20,000 as a way to evade Google Play Store defenses. "The most popular application categories to hide malware and unwanted software include cryptocurrency trackers, financial apps, QR-code scanners, and even dating apps," Kaspersky  said  in a new report based on messages posted on online forums between 2019 and 2023. Dropper apps  are the primary means for threat actors looking to sneak malware via the Google Play Store. Such apps often masquerade as seemingly innocuous apps, with malicious updates introduced upon clearing the review process and the applications have amassed a significant user base. This is achieved by using a loader program that's responsible for injecting malware into a clean app, which is then made available for download from the app marketplace. Users who install the tampered app are prompted to grant it intrusive permiss

In today's perilous cyber risk landscape, CISOs and CIOs must defend their organizations against relentless cyber threats, including ransomware, phishing, attacks on infrastructure, supply chain breaches, malicious insiders, and much more. Yet at the same time, security leaders are also under tremendous pressure to reduce costs and invest wisely.  One of the most effective ways for CISOs and CIOs to make the best use of their limited resources to protect their organizations is by conducting a cyber risk assessment. A comprehensive cyber risk assessment can help: Identify vulnerabilities and threats Prioritize security investments Assess cybersecurity maturity Communicate cyber risk to executives Provide the basis for cyber risk quantification A new guide by cybersecurity optimization provider CYE ( download here ) explains how this can be accomplished.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the inner workings of the cryptocurrency stealer malware that was distributed via 13 malicious NuGet packages as part of a supply chain attack targeting .NET developers. The sophisticated typosquatting campaign, which was  detailed  by JFrog late last month, impersonated legitimate packages to execute PowerShell code designed to retrieve a follow-on binary from a hard-coded server. The  two-stage attack  culminates in the deployment of a .NET-based persistent backdoor, called Impala Stealer, which is capable of gaining unauthorized access to users' cryptocurrency accounts. "The payload used a very rare obfuscation technique, called '.NET AoT compilation,' which is a lot more stealthy than using 'off the shelf' obfuscators while still making the binary hard to reverse engineer," JFrog told The Hacker News in a statement. .NET  AoT compilation  is an  optimization technique  that allows apps to be ahead-of-time c

Estonian National Charged in U.S. for Acquiring Electronics and Metasploit Pro for Russian Military<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/estonian-national-charged-in-us-for.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Estonian national has been  charged  in the U.S. for purchasing U.S.-made electronics on behalf of the Russian government and military. The 45-year-old individual, Andrey Shevlyakov, was arrested on March 28, 2023, in Tallinn. He has been indicted with 18 counts of conspiracy and other charges. If found guilty, he faces up to 20 years in prison. Court documents allege that Shevlyakov operated front companies that were used to import sensitive electronics from U.S. manufacturers. The goods were then shipped to Russia, bypassing export restrictions. The purchased items included analog-to-digital converters and low-noise pre-scalers and synthesizers that are found in defense systems. Shevlyakov is also accused of attempting to acquire hacking tools like Rapid7 Metasploit Pro, a legitimate penetration testing and adversary simulation software. Although Shevlyakov was placed in Entity List in 2012 by the U.S. government for acting as a procurement agent for Russia, he is said to ha

Hackers Flood NPM with Bogus Packages Causing a DoS Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/hackers-flood-npm-with-bogus-packages.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are flooding the npm open source package repository with bogus packages that briefly even resulted in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. "The threat actors create malicious websites and publish empty packages with links to those malicious websites, taking advantage of open-source ecosystems' good reputation on search engines," Checkmarx's Jossef Harush Kadouri  said  in a report published last week. "The attacks caused a denial-of-service (DoS) that made NPM unstable with sporadic 'Service Unavailable' errors." While  similar campaigns  were recently observed propagating phishing links, the latest wave pushed the number of package versions to 1.42 million, a dramatic uptick from the approximate 800,000 packages released on npm. The attack technique leverages the fact that open source repositories are ranked higher on search engine results to create rogue websites and upload empty npm modules with links to those sites in the README.

As technology advances, cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated. With the increasing use of technology in our daily lives, cybercrime is on the rise, as evidenced by the fact that cyberattacks caused  92% of all data breaches  in the first quarter of 2022. Staying current with cybersecurity trends and laws is crucial to combat these threats, which can significantly impact business development.  In 2023, the cybersecurity market is expected to see new trends, and businesses must be adequately prepared for any developments.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Over one million WordPress websites are estimated to have been infected by an ongoing campaign to deploy malware called  Balada Injector   since 2017 . The massive campaign, per GoDaddy's Sucuri, "leverages all known and recently discovered theme and plugin vulnerabilities" to breach WordPress sites. The attacks are known to play out in waves once every few weeks. "This campaign is easily identified by its preference for  String.fromCharCode  obfuscation, the use of freshly registered domain names hosting malicious scripts on random subdomains, and by redirects to various scam sites," security researcher Denis Sinegubko  said . The websites include  fake tech support , fraudulent lottery wins, and rogue CAPTCHA pages urging users to turn on notifications to 'Please Allow to verify, that you are not a robot,' thereby enabling the actors to send spam ads. The report builds on  recent findings  from Doctor Web, which detailed a Linux malware family th

Taiwanese PC company MSI (short for Micro-Star International) officially confirmed it was the victim of a cyber attack on its systems. The company said it "promptly" initiated incident response and recovery measures after detecting "network anomalies." It also said it alerted law enforcement agencies of the matter. That said, MSI did not disclose any specifics about when the attack took place and if it entailed the exfiltration of any proprietary information, including source code. "Currently, the affected systems have gradually resumed normal operations, with no significant impact on financial business," the company said in a  brief notice  shared on Friday. In a  regulatory filing  with the Taiwan Stock Exchange, it said that it's setting up enhanced controls of its network and infrastructure to ensure the security of data.

The Iranian nation-state group known as  MuddyWater  has been observed carrying out destructive attacks on hybrid environments under the guise of a ransomware operation. That's according to new findings from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team, which discovered the threat actor targeting both on-premises and cloud infrastructures in partnership with another emerging activity cluster dubbed  DEV-1084 . "While the threat actors attempted to masquerade the activity as a standard ransomware campaign, the unrecoverable actions show destruction and disruption were the ultimate goals of the operation," the tech giant  revealed  Friday. MuddyWater  is the name assigned to an  Iran-based actor  that the U.S. government has publicly connected to the country's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). It's been known to be active since at least 2017. It's also tracked by the cybersecurity community under various names, including Boggy Serpens, Cobalt Ulster,

The maintainers of the vm2 JavaScript sandbox module have shipped a patch to address a critical flaw that could be abused to break out of security boundaries and execute arbitrary shellcode. The flaw, which affects all versions, including and prior to 3.9.14, was  reported  by researchers from South Korea-based  KAIST WSP Lab  on April 6, 2023, prompting vm2 to release a fix with  version 3.9.15  on Friday. "A threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox," vm2  disclosed  in an advisory. The vulnerability has been assigned the identified  CVE-2023-29017  and is rated 9.8 on the CVSS scoring system. The issue stems from the fact that it does not properly handle errors that occur in asynchronous functions. vm2 is a  popular library  that's used to run untrusted code in an isolated environment on Node.js. It has nearly four million weekly downloads and is used in 721 packages . KAIST security res

In yet another sign that Telegram is increasingly becoming a  thriving hub  for cybercrime, researchers have found that threat actors are using the messaging platform to peddle phishing kits and help set up phishing campaigns. "To promote their 'goods,' phishers create Telegram channels through which they educate their audience about phishing and entertain subscribers with polls like, 'What type of personal data do you prefer?'," Kaspersky web content analyst Olga Svistunova  said  in a report published this week. The links to these Telegram channels are distributed via YouTube, GitHub, and the phishing kits that are developed by the crooks themselves. The Russian cybersecurity firm said it detected over 2.5 million malicious URLs generated using phishing kits in the past six months. One of the prominent services offered is to provide threat actors with Telegram bots that automate the process of generating phishing pages and collecting user data. Although

Microsoft said it teamed up with Fortra and Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Health-ISAC) to tackle the abuse of Cobalt Strike by cybercriminals to distribute malware, including ransomware. To that end, the tech giant's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) revealed that it secured a  court order  in the U.S. to "remove illegal, legacy copies of Cobalt Strike so they can no longer be used by cybercriminals." While Cobalt Strike, developed and maintained by Fortra (formerly HelpSystems), is a legitimate post-exploitation tool used for adversary simulation, illegal cracked versions of the software have been weaponized by threat actors over the years. Ransomware groups, in particular, have leveraged Cobalt Strike after obtaining initial access to a target environment to escalate privileges, lateral move across the network, and deploy file-encrypting malware.

Less than a month ago, Twitter indirectly acknowledged that some of its source code had been leaked on the code-sharing platform GitHub by sending a copyright infringement notice to take down the incriminated repository. The latter is now inaccessible, but according to the media, it was accessible to the public for several months. A user going by the name FreeSpeechEnthousiast committed thousands of documents belonging to the social media platform over several months.  While there is no concrete evidence to support this hypothesis, the timing of the leak and the ironic username used by the perpetrator suggest that the leak was a deliberate act aimed at causing harm to the company. Although it is still too early to measure the impact of this leak on the health of Twitter, this incident should be an opportunity for all software vendors to ask a simple question:  what if this happened to us?

CISA Warns of Critical ICS Flaws in Hitachi, mySCADA, ICL, and Nexx Products<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/cisa-warns-of-critical-ics-flaws-in.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has  published   eight  Industrial Control Systems (ICS) advisories warning of critical flaws affecting products from Hitachi Energy, mySCADA Technologies, Industrial Control Links, and Nexx. Topping the list is  CVE-2022-3682  (CVSS score: 9.9), impacting Hitachi Energy's MicroSCADA System Data Manager SDM600 that could allow an attacker to take remote control of the product. The flaw stems from an issue with file permission validation, thereby permitting an adversary to upload a specially crafted message to the system, leading to arbitrary code execution. Hitachi Energy has released SDM600 1.3.0.1339 to  mitigate  the issue for SDM600 versions prior to version 1.2 FP3 HF4 (Build Nr. 1.2.23000.291).

Critical infrastructure attacks are a preferred target for cyber criminals. Here's why and what's being done to protect them. What is Critical Infrastructure and Why is It Attacked? Critical infrastructure is the physical and digital assets, systems and networks that are vital to national security, the economy, public health, or safety. It can be government- or privately-owned. According to Etay Maor, Senior Director Security Strategy at  Cato Networks , "It's interesting to note critical infrastructure doesn't necessarily have to be power plants or electricity. A nation's monetary system or even a global monetary system can be and should be considered a critical infrastructure as well." These qualities make critical infrastructure a preferred target for cyber attacks. If critical infrastructure is disrupted, the impact is significant. In some cases, such cyber attacks on critical infrastructure have become another means of modern warfare. But unlike

A coordinated international law enforcement operation has dismantled Genesis Market, an illegal online marketplace that specialized in the sale of stolen credentials associated with email, bank accounts, and social media platforms. Coinciding with the infrastructure seizure, the major crackdown, which involved authorities from 17 countries, culminated in 119 arrests and 208 property searches in 13 nations. However, the  .onion mirror of the market  appears to be still up and running . The "unprecedented"  law   enforcement   exercise  has been codenamed  Operation Cookie Monster . Genesis Market, since its inception in March 2018, evolved into a major hub for criminal activities, offering access to data stolen from over 1.5 million compromised computers across the world totaling more than 80 million credentials.

Google is enacting a new data deletion policy for Android apps that allow account creation to also offer users with a setting to delete their accounts in an attempt to provide more transparency and control over their data. "For apps that enable app account creation, developers will soon need to provide an option to initiate account and data deletion from within the app and online," Bethel Otuteye, senior director of product management for Android App Safety,  said . "This web requirement, which you will link in your  Data safety form , is especially important so that a user can request account and data deletion without having to reinstall an app." The goal, the search behemoth said, is to have a "readily discoverable option" to initiate an app account deletion process from both within an app and outside of it. To that end, developers are to provide users with an in-app path as well as a web link resource to request app account deletion and associated

"The clipper malware uses regular expressions (regexes) to identify what type of cryptocurrency the address pertains to," Unit 42 researchers said.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor used a malicious self-extracting archive ( SFX ) file in an attempt to establish persistent backdoor access to a victim's environment, new findings from CrowdStrike show. SFX files are capable of extracting the data contained within them without the need for dedicated software to display the file contents. It achieves this by including a decompressor stub, a piece of code that's executed to unpack the archive. "However, SFX archive files can also contain hidden malicious functionality that may not be immediately visible to the file's recipient, and could be missed by technology-based detections alone," CrowdStrike researcher Jai Minton  said . In the case investigated by the cybersecurity firm, compromised credentials to a system were used to run a legitimate Windows accessibility application called Utility Manager (utilman.exe) and subsequently launch a password-protected SFX file.

A North Korean government-backed threat actor has been linked to attacks targeting government and military personnel, think tanks, policy makers, academics, and researchers in South Korea and the U.S. Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) is  tracking  the cluster under the name  ARCHIPELAGO , which it said is a subset of another threat group tracked by Mandiant under the name  APT43 . The tech giant said it began monitoring the hacking crew in 2012, adding it has "observed the group target individuals with expertise in North Korea policy issues such as sanctions, human rights, and non-proliferation issues." The priorities of APT43, and by extension ARCHIPELAGO, are said to align with North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), the primary foreign intelligence service, suggesting overlaps with a group broadly known as  Kimsuky . Attack chains mounted by ARCHIPELAGO involve the use of phishing emails containing malicious links that, when clicked by the reci

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Every year hundreds of millions of malware attacks occur worldwide, and every year businesses deal with the impact of viruses, worms, keyloggers, and ransomware. Malware is a pernicious threat and the biggest driver for businesses to look for cybersecurity solutions.  Naturally, businesses want to find products that will stop malware in its tracks, and so they search for solutions to do that. But  malware protection  alone is not enough, instead what's needed is a more holistic approach. Businesses need to defend against malware entering the network, and then on top of that have systems and processes in place to restrict the damage that malware can do if it infects a user device.  This approach will not only help stop and mitigate the damage from malware, but defend against other types of threats too, such as credential theft as a result of phishing, insider threats, and supply-chain attacks.  Element 1: Malware Protection and Web Filtering The first and most sensible place to

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor behind the information-stealing malware known as  Typhon Reborn  has resurfaced with an updated version (V2) that packs in improved capabilities to evade detection and resist analysis. The new version is offered for sale on the criminal underground for $59 per month, $360 per year, or alternatively, for $540 for a lifetime subscription. "The stealer can harvest and exfiltrate sensitive information and uses the Telegram API to send stolen data to attackers," Cisco Talos researcher Edmund Brumaghin  said  in a Tuesday report. Typhon was  first documented  by Cyble in August 2022, detailing its myriad features, including hijacking clipboard content, capturing screenshots, logging keystrokes, and stealing data from crypto wallet, messaging, FTP, VPN, browser, and gaming apps. Based on another stealer malware called  Prynt Stealer , Typhon is also capable of delivering the XMRig cryptocurrency miner. In November 2022, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42  unearthed  an

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Clouded vision CTI systems are confronted with some major issues ranging from the size of the collection networks to their diversity, which ultimately influence the degree of confidence they can put on their signals. Are they fresh enough and sufficiently reliable to avoid any false positives or any poisoning? Do I risk acting on outdated data? This difference is major since a piece of information is just a decision helper, whereas a piece of actionable information can directly be weaponized against an aggressor. If raw data are the hayfields, information is the haystacks, and needles are the actionable signal. To illustrate the collection networks' size & variety point, without naming anyone in particular, let's imagine a large CDN provider. Your role is to deliver, on a massive scale, content over HTTP(s). This attracts a lot of "attention" and signals, but only on the HTTP layer.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a previously undocumented ransomware strain called  Rorschach  that's both sophisticated and fast. "What makes Rorschach stand out from other ransomware strains is its high level of customization and its technically unique features that have not been seen before in ransomware," Check Point Research  said  in a new report. "In fact, Rorschach is one of the  fastest ransomware strains  ever observed, in terms of the speed of its encryption." The cybersecurity firm said it observed the ransomware deployed against an unnamed U.S.-based company, adding it found no branding or overlaps that connect it to any previously known ransomware actors. However, further analysis of Rorschach's source code reveals similarities to  Babuk ransomware , which suffered a leak in September 2021, and  LockBit 2.0 . On top of that, the ransom notes sent out to the victims appear to be inspired by that of  Yanluowang  and  DarkSi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Chromium-based web browsers are the target of a new malware called Rilide that masquerades itself as a seemingly legitimate extension to harvest sensitive data and siphon cryptocurrency. "Rilide malware is disguised as a legitimate Google Drive extension and enables threat actors to carry out a broad spectrum of malicious activities, including monitoring  browsing history, taking screenshots, and injecting malicious scripts to withdraw funds from various cryptocurrency exchanges," Trustwave SpiderLabs Research said in a report shared with The Hacker News. What's more, the stealer malware can display forged dialogs to deceive users into entering a two-factor authentication code to withdraw digital assets. Trustwave said it identified two different campaigns involving  Ekipa RAT  and  Aurora Stealer  that led to the installation of the malicious browser extension. While Ekipa RAT is distributed via booby-trapped Microsoft Publisher files, rogue Google Ads act as t

Arid Viper Hacking Group Using Upgraded Malware in Middle East Cyber Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/arid-viper-hacking-group-using-upgraded.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor known as  Arid Viper  has been observed using refreshed variants of its malware toolkit in its attacks targeting Palestinian entities since September 2022. Symantec, which is tracking the group under its insect-themed moniker Mantis,  said  the adversary is "going to great lengths to maintain a persistent presence on targeted networks." Also known by the names  APT-C-23 and Desert Falcon , the hacking group has been linked to attacks aimed at Palestine and the Middle East at least since 2014. Mantis has used an arsenal of homemade malware tools such as  ViperRat ,  FrozenCell  (aka VolatileVenom), and  Micropsia  to execute and conceal its campaigns across Windows, Android, and iOS platforms. The threat actors are believed to be native Arabic speakers and based in Palestine, Egypt, and Turkey, according to a  report  published by Kaspersky in February 2015. Prior public reporting has also  tied the group  to the cyber warfare division of Hamas. In Apri

Collaboration sits at the essence of SaaS applications. The word, or some form of it, appears in the top two headlines on Google Workspace's homepage. It can be found six times on Microsoft 365's homepage, three times on Box, and once on Workday. Visit nearly any SaaS site, and odds are 'collaboration' will appear as part of the app's key selling point.  By sitting on the cloud, content within the applications is immediately shareable, making it easier than ever to work with others.  However, that shareability is a two-sided coin. On the flip side are often sensitive links sitting on public-facing websites that can be easily accessed. The exposure caused by leaked documents can cause tremendous harm, from competitors trying to gather corporate secrets to whistleblowers sharing internal information with reporters or legislators. As integral as collaboration is to SaaS, sharing links creates a high-risk situation, and real-life breaches, that can be mitigated through the right process

Microsoft has announced plans to automatically block embedded files with "dangerous extensions" in OneNote following reports that the note-taking service is being  increasingly abused  for malware delivery. Up until now, users were shown a dialog warning them that opening such attachments could harm their computer and data, but it was possible to dismiss the prompt and open the files. That's going to change going forward. Microsoft said it intends to prevent users from directly opening an embedded file with a dangerous extension and display the message: "Your administrator has blocked your ability to open this file type in OneNote." The update is expected to start rolling out with Version 2304 later this month and only impacts OneNote for Microsoft 365 on devices running Windows. It does not affect other platforms, including macOS, Android, and iOS, as well as OneNote versions available on the web and for Windows 10. "By default, OneNote blocks the sa

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The adversary behind the  supply chain attack targeting 3CX  deployed a second-stage implant specifically singling out a small number of cryptocurrency companies. Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which has been  internally tracking  the versatile backdoor under the name  Gopuram  since 2020, said it observed an increase in the number of infections in March 2023 coinciding with the 3CX breach. Gopuram's primary function is to connect to a command-and-control (C2) server and await further instructions that allow the attackers to interact with the victim's file system, create processes, and launch as many as eight in-memory modules. The backdoor's links to North Korea stem from the fact that it "co-existed on victim machines with  AppleJeus , a backdoor attributed to the Korean-speaking threat actor Lazarus," detailing an attack on an unnamed crypto firm located in Southeast Asia in 2020.

Data storage devices maker Western Digital on Monday disclosed a "network security incident" that involved unauthorized access to its systems. The  breach  is said to have occurred on March 26, 2023, enabling an unnamed third party to gain access to a "number of the company's systems." Following the discovery of the hack, Western Digital said it has initiated incident response efforts and enlisted the help of cybersecurity and forensic experts to conduct an investigation. It also said it's coordinating with law enforcement agencies on the matter, adding the probe is in its initial stages. The company has taken several of its services offline, noting that the threat actor may have obtained "certain data from its systems" and that it's working on estimating the nature and scope of the data accessed.

The Italian data protection watchdog, Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali (aka Garante), has imposed a temporary ban of OpenAI's ChatGPT service in the country, citing data protection concerns.

General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) laws. "No information is provided to users and data subjects whose data are collected by Open AI," the Garante  noted . "More importantly, there appears to be no legal basis underpinning the massive collection and processing of personal data in order to 'train' the algorithms on which the platform relies."

Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions are regarded as the common practice to prevent identity threats to administrative accounts. In theory, the PAM concept makes absolute sense: place admin credentials in a vault, rotate their passwords, and closely monitor their sessions. However, the harsh reality is that the vast majority of PAM projects either become a years-long project, or even come to a halt altogether, preventing them from delivering their promised security value. In this article, we explore what makes  service accounts a key obstacle in PAM onboarding . We'll learn why vaulting and password rotation of service accounts are an almost impossible task, resulting in leaving them exposed to compromise. We'll then conclude with introducing how Silverfort enables identity teams, for the first time, to overcome these challenges with automated discovery, monitoring, and protection of service accounts, and streamline PAM onboarding process in mere weeks.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A piece of new information-stealing malware called  OpcJacker  has been spotted in the wild since the second half of 2022 as part of a malvertising campaign. "OpcJacker's main functions include keylogging, taking screenshots, stealing sensitive data from browsers, loading additional modules, and replacing cryptocurrency addresses in the clipboard for hijacking purposes," Trend Micro researchers Jaromir Horejsi and Joseph C. Chen  said . The initial vector of the campaign involves a network of fake websites advertising seemingly innocuous software and cryptocurrency-related applications. The February 2023 campaign specifically singled out users in Iran under the pretext of offering a VPN service. The installer files act as a conduit to deploy OpcJacker, which is also capable of delivering next-stage payloads such as  NetSupport RAT  and a hidden virtual network computing ( hVNC ) variant for remote access. OpcJacker is concealed using a  crypter  known as Babadeda an

Microsoft Fixes New Azure AD Vulnerability Impacting Bing Search and Major Apps<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/microsoft-fixes-new-azure-ad.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has patched a misconfiguration issue impacting the Azure Active Directory ( AAD ) identity and access management service that exposed several "high-impact" applications to unauthorized access. "One of these apps is a content management system (CMS) that powers Bing.com and allowed us to not only modify search results, but also launch high-impact XSS attacks on Bing users," cloud security firm Wiz  said  in a report. "Those attacks could compromise users' personal data, including Outlook emails and SharePoint documents." The issues were reported to Microsoft in January and February 2022, following which the tech giant applied fixes and awarded Wiz a $40,000 bug bounty. Redmond  said  it found no evidence that the misconfigurations were exploited in the wild. The crux of the vulnerability stems from what's called "Shared Responsibility confusion," wherein an Azure app can be incorrectly configured to allow users from any Micro

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Critical security flaws in Cacti, Realtek, and IBM Aspera Faspex are being exploited by various threat actors in hacks targeting unpatched systems. This entails the abuse of  CVE-2022-46169  (CVSS score: 9.8) and  CVE-2021-35394  (CVSS score: 9.8) to deliver  MooBot  and  ShellBot  (aka PerlBot), Fortinet FortiGuard Labs  said  in a report published this week. CVE-2022-46169  relates to a critical authentication bypass and command injection flaw in Cacti servers that allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code.  CVE-2021-35394  also concerns an arbitrary command injection vulnerability impacting the Realtek Jungle SDK that was patched in 2021. While the latter has been previously exploited to distribute botnets like Mirai, Gafgyt, Mozi, and RedGoBot, the development marks the first time it has been utilized to deploy MooBot, a Mirai variant known to be active since 2019. The Cacti flaw, besides being leveraged for MooBot attacks, has also been observed serving ShellB

Hackers Exploiting WordPress Elementor Pro Vulnerability: Millions of Sites at Risk!<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/hackers-exploiting-wordpress-elementor.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Unknown threat actors are actively exploiting a recently patched security vulnerability in the Elementor Pro website builder plugin for WordPress. The flaw, described as a case of broken access control, impacts versions 3.11.6 and earlier. It was addressed by the plugin maintainers in version 3.11.7 released on March 22. "Improved code security enforcement in WooCommerce components," the Elementor  said  in its release notes. The premium plugin is  estimated  to be used on over 12 million sites. Successful exploitation of the high-severity flaw allows an authenticated attacker to complete a takeover of a WordPress site that has WooCommerce enabled. "This makes it possible for a malicious user to turn on the registration page (if disabled) and set the default user role to administrator so they can create an account that instantly has the administrator privileges," Patchstack  said  in an alert of March 30, 2023. "After this, they are likely to either redi

The advanced persistent threat (APT) actor known as Winter Vivern is now targeting officials in Europe and the U.S. as part of an ongoing cyber espionage campaign. "TA473 since at least February 2023 has continuously leveraged an unpatched Zimbra vulnerability in publicly facing webmail portals that allows them to gain access to the email mailboxes of government entities in Europe," Proofpoint  said  in a new report. The enterprise security firm is tracking the activity under its own moniker  TA473  (aka UAC-0114), describing it as an adversarial crew whose operations align with that of Russian and Belarussian geopolitical objectives. What it lacks in sophistication, it makes up for in persistence. In recent months, the group has been linked to attacks targeting  state authorities of Ukraine and Poland  as well as  government officials in India, Lithuania, Slovakia, and the Vatican .

The Cyber Police of Ukraine, in collaboration with law enforcement officials from Czechia, has arrested several members of a cybercriminal gang that set up phishing sites to target European users. Two of the apprehended affiliates are believed to be organizers, with 10 others detained in other territories across the European Union. The suspects are alleged to have created more than 100 phishing portals aimed at users in France, Spain, Poland, Czechia, Portugal, and other nations in the region. These websites masqueraded as online portals offering heavily discounted products below market prices to lure unsuspecting users into placing fake "orders." In reality, the financial information entered on those websites to complete the payments were used to siphon money from the victims' accounts. "For the fraudulent scheme, the participants also created two call centers, in Vinnytsia and in Lviv, and involved operators in their work," the Cyber Police  said . &quo

Organizations rely on Incident response to ensure they are immediately aware of security incidents, allowing for quick action to minimize damage. They also aim to avoid follow on attacks or future related incidents. The SANS Institute provides research and education on information security. In the upcoming webinar, we'll outline , in detail, six components of a SANS incident response plan, including elements such as preparation, identification, containment, and eradication. The 6 steps of a complete IR Preparation:  This is the first phase and involves reviewing existing security measures and policies; performing risk assessments to find potential vulnerabilities; and establishing a communication plan that lays out protocols and alerts staff to potential security risks. During the holidays, the preparation stage of your IR plan is crucial as it gives you the opportunity to communicate holiday-specific threats and put the wheels in motion to address such threats as they are identif

Enterprise communications software maker 3CX on Thursday confirmed that multiple versions of its desktop app for Windows and macOS are affected by a  supply chain attack . The version numbers include  18.12.407 and 18.12.416  for Windows and  18.11.1213, 18.12.402, 18.12.407, and 18.12.416  for macOS. The company said it's engaging the services of Google-owned Mandiant to review the incident. In the interim, it's urging its customers of self-hosted and on-premise versions of the software to update to version 18.12.422. "3CX Hosted and StartUP users do not need to update their servers as we will be updating them over the night automatically," 3CX CEO Nick Galea  said  in a blog post. "Servers will be restarted and the new Electron App MSI/DMG will be installed on the server." Evidence available so far points to either a compromise of 3CX's software build pipeline to distribute Windows and macOS versions of the app package, or alternatively, the poiso

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a now-patched vulnerability in Azure Service Fabric Explorer ( SFX ) that could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. Tracked as  CVE-2023-23383  (CVSS score: 8.2), the issue has been dubbed "Super FabriXss" by Orca Security, a nod to the  FabriXss flaw  (CVE-2022-35829, CVSS score: 6.2) that was fixed by Microsoft in October 2022. "The Super FabriXss vulnerability enables remote attackers to leverage an XSS vulnerability to achieve remote code execution on a container hosted on a Service Fabric node without the need for authentication," security researcher Lidor Ben Shitrit  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. XSS refers to a kind of  client-side code injection  attack that makes it possible to upload malicious scripts into otherwise trusted websites. The scripts then get executed every time a victim visits the compromised website, thereby leading to unintended consequences. While both FabriXss and Super FabriXss

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group tracked as  RedGolf  has been  attributed  to the use of a custom Windows and Linux backdoor called KEYPLUG. "RedGolf is a particularly prolific Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group that has likely been active for many years against a wide range of industries globally," Recorded Future told The Hacker News. "The group has shown the ability to rapidly weaponize  newly reported vulnerabilities (e.g. Log4Shell and  ProxyLogon ) and has a history of developing and using a large range of custom malware families." The use of KEYPLUG by Chinese threat actors was  first disclosed  by Google-owned Manidant in March 2022 in attacks targeting multiple U.S. state government networks between May 2021 and February 2022. Then in October 2022, Malwarebytes  detailed  a separate set of attacks targeting government entities in Sri Lanka in early August that leveraged a novel implant dubbed DBoxAgent to deploy KEYPLUG.

New Wi-Fi Protocol Security Flaw Affecting Linux, Android and iOS Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/new-wi-fi-protocol-security-flaw.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics from Northeastern University and KU Leuven has disclosed a fundamental design flaw in the IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi protocol standard, impacting a wide range of devices running Linux, FreeBSD, Android, and iOS. Successful exploitation of the shortcoming could be abused to hijack TCP connections or intercept client and web traffic, researchers Domien Schepers, Aanjhan Ranganathan, and Mathy Vanhoef said in a paper published this week. The  approach  exploits  power-save mechanisms  in endpoint devices to trick access points into leaking  data frames  in plaintext, or encrypt them using  an all-zero key . "The unprotected nature of the power-save bit in a frame's header [...] also allows an adversary to force queue frames intended for a specific client resulting in its disconnection and trivially executing a denial-of-service attack," the researchers noted. In other words, the goal is to leak frames from the access point destined to a victim client station

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multi-cloud data storage, once merely a byproduct of the great cloud migration, has now become a strategy for data management. "Multi-cloud by design," and its companion the supercloud, is an ecosystem in which several cloud systems work together to provide many organizational benefits, including increased scale and overall resiliency. And now, even security teams who have long been the holdout on wide-scale cloud adoption, may find a reason to rejoice. Born out of the multi-cloud approach, cyberstorage enables companies to not only enjoy the benefits that multi-cloud brings but also eliminate the risk of data exposure at the same time, marking the beginning of the multi-cloud maturity era. What Is The Supercloud? While many organizations ended up with multiple cloud services as a byproduct of interdepartmental needs, today organizations are intentionally building multi-cloud environments. And rather than manage the various cloud services individually, many are implementin

3CX said it's  working on a software update  for its desktop app after multiple cybersecurity vendors sounded the alarm on what appears to be an active supply chain attack that's using digitally signed and rigged installers of the popular voice and video conferencing software to target downstream customers. "The trojanized 3CX desktop app is the first stage in a multi-stage attack chain that pulls ICO files appended with Base64 data from GitHub and ultimately leads to a third-stage infostealer DLL," SentinelOne researchers  said . The cybersecurity firm is tracking the activity under the name SmoothOperator , stating the threat actor registered a massive attack infrastructure as far back as February 2022. There are indications that the attack may have commenced around March 22, 2023. 3CX, the company behind 3CXDesktopApp,  claims  to have more than 600,000 customers and 12 million users in 190 countries, some of which include well-known names like American Expres

Spyware Vendors Caught Exploiting Zero-Day Vulnerabilities on Android and iOS Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/spyware-vendors-caught-exploiting-zero.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A number of zero-day vulnerabilities that were addressed last year were exploited by commercial spyware vendors to target Android and iOS devices, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has revealed. The two distinct campaigns were both limited and highly targeted, taking advantage of the patch gap between the release of a fix and when it was actually deployed on the targeted devices. "These vendors are enabling the proliferation of dangerous hacking tools, arming governments that would not be able to develop these capabilities in-house," TAG's Clement Lecigne  said  in a new report. "While use of surveillance technologies may be legal under national or international laws, they are often found to be used by governments to target dissidents, journalists, human rights workers, and opposition party politicians." The first of the two operations took place in November 2022 and involved sending shortened links over SMS messages to users located in Italy, Malays

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown Chinese state-sponsored hacking group has been linked to a novel piece of malware aimed at Linux servers. French cybersecurity firm ExaTrack, which found three samples of the previously documented malicious software that date back to early 2022, dubbed it  Mélofée . One of the artifacts is designed to drop a kernel-mode rootkit that's based on an open source project referred to as  Reptile . "According to the vermagic metadata, it is compiled for a kernel version 5.10.112-108.499.amzn2.x86_64," the company  said  in a report. "The rootkit has a limited set of features, mainly installing a hook designed for hiding itself." Both the implant and the rootkit are said to be deployed using shell commands that download an installer and a custom binary package from a remote server. The installer takes the binary package as an argument and then extracts the rootkit as well as a server implant module that's currently under active development. Mélofé

Malware analysis is an essential part of security researcher's work. But working with malicious samples can be dangerous — it requires specialized tools to record their activity, and a secure environment to prevent unintended damage. However, manual lab setup and configuration can prove to be a laborious and time-consuming process. In this article, we'll look at 4 ways to create a reverse engineering lab, discuss how to save time, and, potentially, improve the detection rate using a cloud service, and a recommended list of tools for a comprehensive setup. What is a malware analysis lab? In essence, a malware analysis lab provides a safe, isolated space for examining malware. The setup can range from a straightforward virtual machine using VirtualBox to a more intricate network of interconnected machines and actual networking hardware. But in this article, we'll look at building a lab tailored for static analysis, so what we will need is a secure environment where we

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The emergence of smart mobility services and applications has led to a sharp increase in the use of APIs in the automotive industry. However, this increased reliance on APIs has also made them one of the most common attack vectors. According to Gartner, APIs account for 90% of the web application attack surface areas.  With no surprise, similar trends are emerging also in the smart mobility space. A recent  Automotive and Smart Mobility Cybersecurity Report  by Upstream Security indicates that the automotive and smart mobility ecosystem has seen a 380% increase in API-based incidents in 2022, compared to 2021. Additionally, APIs accounted for 12% of total cyber incidents in 2022, up from only 2% in 2021.  When examining smart mobility applications and services, Upstream's threat intelligence team reported that black-hat actors were found to be behind 53% of incidents, indicating malicious intent as the driving force of the majority of API-related attacks.

Trojanized TOR Browser Installers Spreading Crypto-Stealing Clipper Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/trojanized-tor-browser-installers.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Trojanized installers for the TOR anonymity browser are being used to target users in Russia and Eastern Europe with  clipper malware  designed to siphon cryptocurrencies since September 2022. "Clipboard injectors [...] can be silent for years, show no network activity or any other signs of presence until the disastrous day when they replace a crypto wallet address," Vitaly Kamluk, director of global research and analysis team (GReAT) for APAC at Kaspersky,  said . Another notable aspect of clipper malware is that its nefarious functions are not triggered unless the clipboard data meet specific criteria, making it more evasive. It's not immediately clear how the installers are distributed, but evidence points to the use of torrent downloads or some unknown third-party source since the Tor Project's website has been  subjected  to  blockades  in  Russia  in recent years. Regardless of the method used, the installer launches the legitimate executable, while also s

North Korean APT43 Group Uses Cybercrime to Fund Espionage Operations<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/north-korean-apt43-group-uses.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new North Korean nation-state cyber operator has been attributed to a series of campaigns orchestrated to gather strategic intelligence that aligns with Pyongyang's geopolitical interests since 2018. Google-owned Mandiant, which is tracking the activity cluster under the moniker  APT43 , said the group's motives are both espionage- and financially-motivated, leveraging techniques like  credential harvesting  and social engineering to further its objectives. The monetary angle to its attack campaigns is an attempt on the part of the threat actor to generate funds to meet its "primary mission of collecting strategic intelligence." Victimology patterns suggest that targeting is focused on South Korea, the U.S., Japan, and Europe, spanning government, education, research, policy institutes, business services, and manufacturing sectors. The threat actor was also observed straying off course by striking health-related verticals and pharma companies from October 2020

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An advanced persistent threat (APT) group that has a track record of targeting India and Afghanistan has been linked to a new phishing campaign that delivers Action RAT. According to Cyble, which  attributed  the operation to  SideCopy , the activity cluster is designed to target the Defence Research and Development Organization ( DRDO ), the research and development wing of India's Ministry of Defence. Known for emulating the infection chains associated with  SideWinder  to deliver its own malware, SideCopy is a threat group of Pakistani origin that shares overlaps with  Transparent Tribe . It has been active since at least 2019. Attack chains mounted by the group involve using spear-phishing emails to gain initial access. These messages come bearing a ZIP archive file that contains a Windows shortcut file (.LNK) masquerading as information about the  K-4 ballistic missile  developed by DRDO. Executing the .LNK file leads to the retrieval of an HTML application from a remote

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple threat actors have been observed using two new variants of the  IcedID malware  in the wild with more limited functionality that removes functionality related to online banking fraud. IcedID, also known as BokBot, started off as a banking trojan in 2017. It's also capable of delivering additional malware, including ransomware. "The well-known IcedID version consists of an initial loader which contacts a Loader [command-and-control] server, downloads the standard DLL Loader, which then delivers the standard IcedID Bot," Proofpoint  said  in a new report published Monday. One of the new versions is a Lite variant that was  previously highlighted  as being dropped as a follow-on payload by the  Emotet malware  in November 2022. Also newly observed in February 2023 is a Forked variant of IcedID. Both these variants are designed to drop what's called a Forked version of IcedID Bot that leaves out the web injects and backconnect functionality that would typic

The exploitation of cloud-based technologies:  Cloud-based services are increasingly being targeted by malicious actors due to the lack of visibility and control over these platforms. Increased use of ransomware:  Ransomware is becoming a more popular method of attack, allowing malicious actors to monetize their operations quickly. According to  CompTIA , ransomware attacks grew by 41% in 2022, while identification and remediation for a breach took 49 days longer than average. Phishing attacks  also increas

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing campaign has set its sights on European entities to distribute Remcos RAT and Formbook via a malware loader dubbed  DBatLoader . "The malware payload is distributed through WordPress websites that have authorized SSL certificates, which is a common tactic used by threat actors to evade detection engines," Zscaler researchers Meghraj Nandanwar and Satyam Singh  said  in a report published Monday. The findings build upon a previous report from SentinelOne last month that detailed phishing emails containing malicious attachments that masquerade as financial documents to activate the infection chain. Some of the file formats used to distribute the DBatLoader payload concern the use of a multi-layered obfuscated HTML file and OneNote attachments. The development adds to  growing abuse  of  OneNote files  as an initial vector for malware distribution since late last year in response to Microsoft's decision to block macros by default in files downloaded f

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday  signed an executive order  that restricts the use of commercial spyware by federal government agencies. The order said the spyware ecosystem "poses significant counterintelligence or security risks to the United States Government or significant risks of improper use by a foreign government or foreign person." It also seeks to ensure that the government's use of such tools is done in a manner that's "consistent with respect for the rule of law, human rights, and democratic norms and values." To that end, the order lays out the various criteria under which commercial spyware could be disqualified for use by U.S. government agencies. They include - The purchase of commercial spyware by a foreign government or person to target the U.S. government, A commercial spyware vendor that uses or discloses sensitive data obtained from the cyber surveillance tool without authorization and operates under the control of a foreign g

Apple on Monday backported fixes for an actively exploited security flaw to older iPhone and iPad models. The issue, tracked as  CVE-2023-23529 , concerns a type confusion bug in the WebKit browser engine that could lead to arbitrary code execution. It was  originally addressed  by the tech giant with improved checks as part of updates released on February 13, 2023. An anonymous researcher has been credited with reporting the bug. "Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution," Apple  said  in a new advisory, adding it's "aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited." Details surrounding the exact nature of exploitation are currently not known, but withholding technical specifics is standard procedure as it helps prevent additional in-the-wild abuse targeting susceptible devices.  The update is available in versions iOS 15.7.4 and iPadOS 15.7.4 for iPhone 6s (all models), iPhone 7 (all models), iPho

Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, the 20-year-old founder and the administrator of the now-defunct BreachForums has been  formally charged  in the U.S. with conspiracy to commit access device fraud. If proven guilty, Fitzpatrick, who went by the online moniker "pompompurin," faces a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison. He was  arrested  on March 15, 2023. "Cybercrime victimizes and steals financial and personal information from millions of innocent people," said U.S. Attorney Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia. "This arrest sends a direct message to cybercriminals: your exploitative and illegal conduct will be discovered, and you will be brought to justice." The development comes days after Baphomet, the individual who had taken over the responsibilities of BreachForums,  shut down the website , citing concerns that law enforcement may have obtained access to its backend. The Department of Justice (DoJ) has since confirmed that it co

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication method that allows users to authenticate their identity for multiple applications with just one set of credentials. From a security standpoint, SSO is the gold standard. It ensures access without forcing users to remember multiple passwords and can be further secured with MFA. Furthermore, an estimated 61% of attacks stem from stolen credentials. By removing usernames and passwords, the attack surface is reduced as well. SSO helps companies meet strict compliance regulations by not only enabling businesses to secure their accounts, but by helping them demonstrate that they've taken the necessary steps to meet regulatory requirements. While SSO is an important step in securing SaaS apps and their data, having just SSOs in place to secure the SaaS stack in its entirety is not enough. SSO alone won't prevent a threat actor from accessing a SaaS app. It also won't protect SaaS apps that are onboarded without the IT team's knowledg

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new information-stealing malware has set its sights on Apple's macOS operating system to siphon sensitive information from compromised devices. Dubbed  MacStealer , it's the latest example of a threat that uses Telegram as a command-and-control (C2) platform to exfiltrate data. It primarily affects devices running macOS versions Catalina and later running on M1 and M2 CPUs. "MacStealer has the ability to steal documents, cookies from the victim's browser, and login information," Uptycs researchers Shilpesh Trivedi and Pratik Jeware  said  in a new report. First advertised on online hacking forums at the start of the month, it is still a work in progress, with the malware authors planning to add features to capture data from Apple's Safari browser and the Notes app. In its current form, MacStealer is designed to extract iCloud Keychain data, passwords and credit card information from browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Brave.

Microsoft Issues Patch for aCropalypse Privacy Flaw in Windows Screenshot Tools<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/microsoft-issues-patch-for-acropalypse.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has released an out-of-band update to address a privacy-defeating flaw in its screenshot editing tool for Windows 10 and Windows 11. The  issue , dubbed  aCropalypse , could enable malicious actors to recover edited portions of screenshots, potentially revealing sensitive information that may have been cropped out. Tracked as  CVE-2023-28303 , the vulnerability is rated 3.3 on the CVSS scoring system. It affects both the Snip & Sketch app on Windows 10 and the Snipping Tool on Windows 11. "The severity of this vulnerability is Low because successful exploitation requires uncommon user interaction and several factors outside of an attacker's control," Microsoft  said  in an advisory released on March 24, 2023. Successful exploitation requires that the following two prerequisites are met - The user must take a screenshot, save it to a file, modify the file (for example, crop it), and then save the modified file to the same location. The user must open

In what's a case of setting a thief to catch a thief, the U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) revealed that it has created a network of fake DDoS-for-hire websites to infiltrate the online criminal underground. "All of the NCA-run sites, which have so far been accessed by around several thousand people, have been created to look like they offer the tools and services that enable cyber criminals to execute these attacks," the law enforcement agency  said . "However, after users register, rather than being given access to cyber crime tools, their data is collated by investigators." The effort is part of an ongoing international joint effort called Operation PowerOFF in collaboration with authorities from the U.S., the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, and Europol aimed at dismantling criminal DDoS-for-hire infrastructures worldwide.

Microsoft Warns of Stealthy Outlook Vulnerability Exploited by Russian Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/microsoft-warns-of-stealthy-outlook.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Friday shared guidance to help customers discover indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with a recently patched Outlook vulnerability. Tracked as CVE-2023-23397 (CVSS score: 9.8), the  critical flaw  relates to a case of privilege escalation that could be exploited to steal NT Lan Manager (NTLM) hashes and stage a  relay attack  without requiring any user interaction. "External attackers could send specially crafted emails that will cause a connection from the victim to an untrusted location of attackers' control," the company  noted  in an advisory released this month. "This will leak the  Net-NTLMv2 hash  of the victim to the untrusted network which an attacker can then relay to another service and authenticate as the victim." The vulnerability was resolved by Microsoft as part of its  Patch Tuesday updates  for March 2023, but not before Russia-based threat actors weaponized the flaw in attacks targeting government, transportation, ene

OpenAI Reveals Redis Bug Behind ChatGPT User Data Exposure Incident<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/openai-reveals-redis-bug-behind-chatgpt.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
OpenAI on Friday disclosed that a bug in the Redis open source library was responsible for the exposure of other users' personal information and chat titles in the upstart's ChatGPT service earlier this week. The  glitch , which came to light on March 20, 2023, enabled certain users to view brief descriptions of other users' conversations from the chat history sidebar, prompting the company to temporarily shut down the chatbot. "It's also possible that the first message of a newly-created conversation was visible in someone else's chat history if both users were active around the same time," the company  said . The bug, it further added, originated in the  redis-py library , leading to a scenario where canceled requests could cause connections to be corrupted and return unexpected data from the database cache, in this case, information belonging to an unrelated user. To make matters worse, the San Francisco-based AI research company said it introduce

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious Python package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository has been found to use Unicode as a trick to evade detection and deploy an info-stealing malware. The package in question, named  onyxproxy , was uploaded to PyPI on March 15, 2023, and comes with capabilities to harvest and exfiltrate credentials and other valuable data. It has since been taken down, but not before attracting a total of  183 downloads . According to software supply chain security firm Phylum, the package incorporates its malicious behavior in a setup script that's packed with thousands of seemingly legitimate code strings. These strings include a mix of bold and italic fonts and are still readable and can be parsed by the Python interpreter, only to activate the execution of the stealer malware upon installation of the package.  "An obvious and immediate benefit of this strange scheme is readability," the company  noted . "Moreover, these visible differences do not prevent

Any app that can improve business operations is quickly added to the SaaS stack. However, employees don't realize that this SaaS-to-SaaS connectivity, which typically takes place outside the view of the security team, significantly increases risk. Whether employees connect through Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, Salesforce, or any other app, security teams have no way to quantify their exposure. These 'secondary' apps can be requesting an intrusive set of permissions or be malicious. Every click authorizing access may grant the right to edit or delete company files, send emails on behalf of the user, create new files, or otherwise handle data in a way that poses a profound threat to the organization's security. To handle the SaaS Security challenges, security teams need to address the entire SaaS ecosystem.  Today's SaaS security evolution has expanded SaaS security beyond simply preventing access.

Cloud-based repository hosting service GitHub said it took the step of replacing its RSA SSH host key used to secure Git operations "out of an abundance of caution" after it was briefly exposed in a public repository. The activity, which was carried out at 05:00 UTC on March 24, 2023, is said to have been undertaken as a measure to prevent any bad actor from impersonating the service or eavesdropping on users' operations over SSH. "This key does not grant access to GitHub's infrastructure or customer data," Mike Hanley, chief security officer and SVP of engineering at GitHub,  said  in a post. "This change only impacts Git operations over SSH using RSA." The move does not impact Web traffic to GitHub.com and Git operations performed via HTTPS. No change is required for ECDSA or Ed25519 users. The Microsoft-owned company said there is no evidence that the exposed SSH private key was exploited by adversaries.

A recent campaign undertaken by  Earth Preta  indicates that nation-state groups aligned with China are getting increasingly proficient at bypassing security solutions. The  threat actor , active since at least 2012, is tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under Bronze President, HoneyMyte, Mustang Panda, RedDelta, and Red Lich. Attack chains mounted by the group commence with a spear-phishing email to deploy a wide range of tools for backdoor access, command-and-control (C2), and data exfiltration. These messages come bearing with malicious lure archives distributed via Dropbox or Google Drive links that employ DLL side-loading, LNK shortcut files, and fake file extensions as arrival vectors to obtain a foothold and drop backdoors like  TONEINS, TONESHELL, PUBLOAD , and  MQsTTang  (aka QMAGENT). Similar infection chains utilizing Google Drive links have been observed  delivering Cobalt Strike  as early as April 2021. "Earth Preta tends to hide malicious payloads

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Patches have been released for a critical security flaw impacting the WooCommerce Payments plugin for WordPress, which is installed on over 500,000 websites. The flaw, if left unresolved, could enable a bad actor to gain unauthorized admin access to impacted stores, the company said in an advisory on March 23, 2023. It impacts versions 4.8.0 through 5.6.1. Put differently, the issue could permit an "unauthenticated attacker to impersonate an administrator and completely take over a website without any user interaction or social engineering required," WordPress security company Wordfence  said . The vulnerability appears to reside in a PHP file called "class-platform-checkout-session.php," Sucuri researcher Ben Martin  noted . Credited with discovering and reporting the vulnerability is Michael Mazzolini of Swiss penetration testing company GoldNetwork. WooCommerce also  said  it worked with WordPress to auto-update sites using affected versions of the softwar

Fake ChatGPT Chrome Browser Extension Caught Hijacking Facebook Accounts<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/fake-chatgpt-chrome-browser-extension.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has stepped in to remove a bogus Chrome browser extension from the official Web Store that masqueraded as OpenAI's ChatGPT service to harvest Facebook session cookies and hijack the accounts. The "ChatGPT For Google" extension, a trojanized version of a  legitimate open source browser add-on , attracted over 9,000 installations since March 14, 2023, prior to its removal. It was originally uploaded to the Chrome Web Store on February 14, 2023. According to  Guardio Labs  researcher Nati Tal, the extension is propagated through  malicious   sponsored Google search results  that are designed to redirect unsuspecting users searching for "Chat GPT-4" to fraudulent landing pages that point to the fake add-on. Installing the extension adds the promised functionality – i.e., enhancing search engines with ChatGPT – but it also stealthily activates the ability to capture Facebook-related cookies and exfiltrate it to a remote server in an encrypted manner.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An emerging Android banking trojan dubbed  Nexus  has already been adopted by several threat actors to target 450 financial applications and conduct fraud. "Nexus appears to be in its early stages of development," Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy  said  in a report published this week. "Nexus provides all the main features to perform ATO attacks (Account Takeover) against banking portals and cryptocurrency services, such as credentials stealing and SMS interception." The trojan, which appeared in various hacking forums at the start of the year, is advertised as a subscription service to its clientele for a monthly fee of $3,000. Details of the malware were  first documented  by Cyble earlier this month. However, there are indications that the malware may have been used in real-world attacks as early as June 2022, at least six months before its official announcement on darknet portals.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In 2022 alone, global cyberattacks increased by 38%, resulting in substantial business loss, including financial and reputational damage. Meanwhile, corporate security budgets have risen significantly because of the growing sophistication of attacks and the number of cybersecurity solutions introduced into the market. With this rise in threats, budgets, and solutions, how prepared are industries and countries to effectively address today's cyber risk?  CYE's new  Cybersecurity Maturity Report 2023  tackles this question by shedding light on the strength of cybersecurity in different sectors, company sizes, and countries. It highlights which industries and countries have the most robust cyber postures and which are lagging, as well as the most prevalent vulnerabilities in today's cyber threat landscape. The analysis is based on two years' worth of data, collected from over 500 organizations in 15 countries, and spanning 11 industries and a range of company sizes. It measures cybersec

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Telecommunication providers in the Middle East are the subject of new cyber attacks that commenced in the first quarter of 2023. The intrusion set has been attributed to a Chinese cyber espionage actor associated with a long-running campaign dubbed  Operation Soft Cell  based on tooling overlaps. "The initial attack phase involves infiltrating Internet-facing Microsoft Exchange servers to deploy web shells used for command execution," researchers from SentinelOne and QGroup said in a  new technical report  shared with The Hacker News. "Once a foothold is established, the attackers conduct a variety of reconnaissance, credential theft, lateral movement, and data exfiltration activities." Operation Soft Cell, according to  Cybereason , refers to malicious activities undertaken by China-affiliated actors targeting telecommunications providers since at least 2012.

German and South Korean government agencies have warned about cyber attacks mounted by a threat actor tracked as  Kimsuky  using rogue browser extensions to steal users' Gmail inboxes. The  joint advisory   comes  from Germany's domestic intelligence apparatus, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), and South Korea's National Intelligence Service of the Republic of Korea (NIS). The intrusions are designed to strike "experts on the Korean Peninsula and North Korea issues" through spear-phishing campaigns, the agencies noted. Kimsuky , also known Black Banshee, Thallium, and Velvet Chollima, refers to a  subordinate element  within North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau and is known to "collect strategic intelligence on geopolitical events and negotiations affecting the DPRK's interests."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has released eight Industrial Control Systems (ICS)  advisories  on Tuesday, warning of critical flaws affecting equipment from Delta Electronics and Rockwell Automation. This includes 13 security vulnerabilities in Delta Electronics' InfraSuite Device Master, a real-time device monitoring software. All versions prior to 1.0.5 are affected by the issues. "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to obtain access to files and credentials, escalate privileges, and remotely execute arbitrary code," CISA  said . Top of the list is  CVE-2023-1133  (CVSS score: 9.8), a critical flaw that arises from the fact that InfraSuite Device Master accepts unverified UDP packets and  deserializes the content , thereby allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. Two other deserialization flaws,  CVE-2023-1139  (CVSS score: 8.8) and  CVE-2023-1145

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) actor dubbed ScarCruft is using weaponized Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) files to download additional malware. According to multiple reports from  AhnLab Security Emergency response Center  ( ASEC ),  SEKOIA.IO , and  Zscaler , the development is illustrative of the group's continuous efforts to refine and retool its tactics to sidestep detection. "The group is constantly evolving its tools, techniques, and procedures while experimenting with new file formats and methods to bypass security vendors," Zscaler researchers Sudeep Singh and Naveen Selvan said in a new analysis published Tuesday.  ScarCruft, also tracked under the names APT37, Reaper, RedEyes, and Ricochet Chollima, has exhibited an increased operational tempo since the start of the year, targeting various South Korean entities for espionage purposes. It is known to be active since at least 2012. Last month, ASEC  disclosed  a campaign that employed

Active Directory (AD) is a powerful authentication and directory service used by organizations worldwide. With this ubiquity and power comes the potential for abuse. Insider threats offer some of the most potentials for destruction. Many internal users have over-provisioned access and visibility into the internal network. Insiders' level of access and trust in a network leads to unique vulnerabilities. Network security often focuses on keeping a threat actor out, not on existing users' security and potential vulnerabilities. Staying on top of potential threats means protecting against inside and outside threats. Active Directory Vulnerabilities From the outside, a properly configured AD domain offers a secure authentication and authorization solution. But with complex social engineering and phishing email attacks, an existing AD user can become compromised. Once inside, threat actors have many options to attack Active Directory.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The  NuGet  repository is the target of a new "sophisticated and highly-malicious attack" aiming to infect .NET developer systems with cryptocurrency stealer malware. The 13 rogue packages, which were downloaded more than 160,000 times over the past month, have since been taken down. "The packages contained a PowerShell script that would execute upon installation and trigger a download of a 'second stage' payload, which could be remotely executed," JFrog researchers Natan Nehorai and Brian Moussalli  said . While NuGet packages have been in the past found to  contain vulnerabilities  and be abused to  propagate phishing links , the development marks the first-ever discovery of packages with malicious code. Three of the most downloaded packages – Coinbase.Core, Anarchy.Wrapper.Net, and DiscordRichPresence.API – alone accounted for 166,000 downloads, although it's also possible that the threat actors artificially inflated the download counts using bo

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat group tracked as  REF2924  has been observed deploying previously unseen malware in its attacks aimed at entities in South and Southeast Asia. The malware, dubbed  NAPLISTENER  by Elastic Security Labs, is an HTTP listener programmed in C# and is designed to evade "network-based forms of detection." REF2924  is the moniker assigned to an activity cluster linked to attacks against an entity in Afghanistan as well as the Foreign Affairs Office of an ASEAN member in 2022. The threat actor's modus operandi suggests overlaps with another hacking group dubbed  ChamelGang , which was documented by Russian cybersecurity company Positive Technologies in October 2021. Attacks orchestrated by the group are said to have exploited internet-exposed Microsoft Exchange servers to  deploy backdoors  such as DOORME, SIESTAGRAPH, and ShadowPad.

In a sudden turn of events, Baphomet, the current administrator of BreachForums, said in an update on March 21, 2023, that the hacking forum has been officially taken down but emphasized that "it's not the end." "You are allowed to hate me, and disagree with my decision but I promise what is to come will be better for us all," Baphomet noted in a message posted on the BreachForums Telegram channel.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Amid the  ongoing war  between Russia and Ukraine, government, agriculture, and transportation organizations located in Donetsk, Lugansk, and Crimea have been attacked as part of an active campaign that drops a previously unseen, modular framework dubbed  CommonMagic . "Although the initial vector of compromise is unclear, the details of the next stage imply the use of spear phishing or similar methods," Kaspersky  said  in a new report. The Russian cybersecurity company, which detected the attacks in October 2022, is tracking the activity cluster under the name "Bad Magic." Attack chains entail the use of booby-trapped URLS pointing to a ZIP archive hosted on a malicious web server. The file, when opened, contains a decoy document and a malicious LNK file that culminates in the deployment of a backdoor named PowerMagic. Written in PowerShell, PowerMagic establishes contact with a remote server and executes arbitrary commands, the results of which are exfiltra

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Poorly managed Linux SSH servers are being targeted as part of a new campaign that deploys different variants of a malware called ShellBot. "ShellBot, also known as  PerlBot , is a DDoS Bot malware developed in Perl and characteristically uses IRC protocol to communicate with the C&C server," AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC)  said  in a report. ShellBot is installed on servers that have weak credentials, but only after threat actors make use of scanner malware to identify systems that have SSH port 22 open. A list of known SSH credentials is used to initiate a dictionary attack to breach the server and deploy the payload, after which it leverages the Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) protocol to communicate with a remote server. This encompasses the ability to receive commands that allows ShellBot to carry out DDoS attacks and exfiltrate harvested information. ASEC said it identified three different ShellBot versions – LiGhT's Modded perlbot v2, DDoS

H0lyGh0st, Magecart, and a slew of state-sponsored hacker groups are diversifying their tactics and shifting their focus to… You. That is, if you're in charge of cybersecurity for a small-to-midsize enterprise (SME). Why? Bad actors know that SMEs typically have a smaller security budget, less infosec manpower, and possibly weak or missing security controls to protect their data and infrastructure. So, how can you prepare for the imminent onslaught from new and emerging threat groups?  You need a plan. Start with the NIST Cyber Security Framework The good news is you don't have to create your security strategy from scratch. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework (NIST CSF) is one of the most respected and widely used standards in the world. While originally designed for critical infrastructure industries, the NIST CSF is flexible enough for organizations of all sizes, sectors, and maturities to use in large part because the framewor

From Ransomware to Cyber Espionage: 55 Zero-Day Vulnerabilities Weaponized in 2022<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/from-ransomware-to-cyber-espionage-55.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as 55 zero-day vulnerabilities were exploited in the wild in 2022, with most of the flaws discovered in software from Microsoft, Google, and Apple. While this figure represents a decrease from the year before, when a staggering 81 zero-days were weaponized, it still represents a significant uptick in recent years of threat actors leveraging unknown security flaws to their advantage. The  findings  come from threat intelligence firm Mandiant, which noted that desktop operating systems (19), web browsers (11), IT and network management products (10), and mobile operating systems (six) accounted for the most exploited product types. Of the 55 zero-day bugs, 13 are estimated to have been abused by cyber espionage groups, with four others exploited by financially motivated threat actors for ransomware-related operations. Commercial spyware vendors were linked to the exploitation of three zero-days. Among state-sponsored groups, those attributed to China have emerged as the most

"The attacker scanned the Digital Ocean cloud hosting IP address space and identified running CAS services on ports 7741, including the General Bytes Cloud service and other GB ATM operators running their servers on Digital Ocean," it further added. The company said that the server to which the malicious Java application was uploaded was by default configured to start applications present in the deployment folder ("/batm/app/admin/standalone/deployments/").

A new piece of malware dubbed  dotRunpeX  is being used to distribute numerous known malware families such as  Agent Tesla ,  Ave Maria ,  BitRAT ,  FormBook ,  LokiBot ,  NetWire ,  Raccoon Stealer ,  RedLine Stealer ,  Remcos ,  Rhadamanthys , and  Vidar . "DotRunpeX is a new injector written in .NET using the Process Hollowing technique and used to infect systems with a variety of known malware families," Check Point  said  in a report published last week. Said to be in active development, dotRunpeX arrives as a second-stage malware in the infection chain, often deployed via a downloader (aka loader) that's transmitted through phishing emails as malicious attachments. Alternatively, it's known to leverage malicious Google Ads on search result pages to direct unsuspecting users searching for popular software such as AnyDesk and LastPass to copycat sites hosting trojanized installers.

A banking trojan dubbed  Mispadu  has been linked to multiple spam campaigns targeting countries like Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Portugal with the goal of stealing credentials and delivering other payloads. The activity, which commenced in August 2022, is currently ongoing, Ocelot Team from Latin American cybersecurity firm Metabase Q said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Mispadu  (aka URSA) was  first documented  by ESET in November 2019, describing its ability to perpetrate monetary and credential theft and act as a backdoor by taking screenshots and capturing keystrokes. "One of their main strategies is to compromise legitimate websites, searching for vulnerable versions of WordPress, to turn them into their command-and-control server to spread malware from there, filtering out countries they do not wish to infect, dropping different type of malware based on the country being infected," researchers Fernando García and Dan Regalado said.

2022 was the year when inflation hit world economies, except in one corner of the global marketplace – stolen data. Ransomware payments fell by over 40% in 2022 compared to 2021. More organisations chose not to pay ransom demands, according to findings by blockchain firm Chainalysis. Nonetheless, stolen data has value beyond a price tag, and in risky ways you may not expect. Evaluating stolen records is what  Lab 1, a new cyber monitoring platform , believes will make a big difference for long-term cybersecurity resilience. Think of data value this way:  Stolen credentials can become future phishing attacks Logins for adult websites are potential extortion attempts Travel and location data are a risk to VIPs and senior leadership, And so on… Hackers could retaliate for non-payment by simply posting their loot to forums where the data will be available for further enrichment and exploitation.  Shining a light on dark places Even though your company may not have suffered a di

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind the CatB ransomware operation have been observed using a technique called  DLL search order hijacking  to evade detection and launch the payload. CatB, also referred to as CatB99 and Baxtoy, emerged late last year and is said to be an "evolution or direct rebrand" of another ransomware strain known as Pandora based on code-level similarities. It's worth noting that the use of Pandora has been attributed to  Bronze Starlight  (aka DEV-0401 or Emperor Dragonfly), a China-based threat actor that's known to employ  short-lived ransomware families  as a ruse to likely conceal its true objectives.  One of the key defining characteristics of CatB is its reliance on DLL hijacking via a legitimate service called Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator ( MSDTC ) to extract and launch the ransomware payload. "Upon execution, CatB payloads rely on DLL search order hijacking to drop and load the malicious payload," SentinelOne researc

Emotet Rises Again: Evades Macro Security via OneNote Attachments<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/emotet-rises-again-evades-macro.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious Emotet malware, in its  return after a short hiatus , is now being distributed via  Microsoft OneNote email attachments  in an attempt to bypass macro-based security restrictions and compromise systems. Emotet , linked to a threat actor tracked as Gold Crestwood, Mummy Spider, or TA542, continues to be a potent and resilient threat despite attempts by law enforcement to take it down. A  derivative  of the  Cridex   banking worm  – which was  subsequently   replaced  by  Dridex  around the same time GameOver Zeus was disrupted in 2014 – Emotet has  evolved  into a "monetized platform for other threat actors to run malicious campaigns on a pay-per-install (PPI) model, allowing theft of sensitive data and ransom extortion." While Emotet infections have acted as a  conduit  to deliver Cobalt Strike, IcedID, Qakbot, Quantum ransomware, and TrickBot, its return in late 2021 was  facilitated  by means of TrickBot. "Emotet is known for extended periods of ina

Chinese Hackers Exploit Fortinet Zero-Day Flaw for Cyber Espionage Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/chinese-hackers-exploit-fortinet-zero.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The zero-day exploitation of a now-patched medium-severity security flaw in the Fortinet  FortiOS  operating system has been linked to a suspected Chinese hacking group. Threat intelligence firm Mandiant, which made the attribution, said the activity cluster is part of a broader campaign designed to deploy backdoors onto Fortinet and VMware solutions and maintain persistent access to victim environments. The Google-owned threat intelligence and incident response firm is tracking the malicious operation under its uncategorized moniker  UNC3886 , a China-nexus threat actor. "UNC3886 is an advanced cyber espionage group with unique capabilities in how they operate on-network as well as the tools they utilize in their campaigns," Mandiant researchers  said  in a technical analysis. "UNC3886 has been observed targeting firewall and virtualization technologies which lack EDR support. Their ability to manipulate firewall firmware and exploit a zero-day indicates they have

U.S. law enforcement authorities have arrested a New York man in connection with running the infamous BreachForums hacking forum under the online alias " Pompompurin ." The development, first reported by  Bloomberg Law , comes after News 12 Westchester, earlier this week, said that federal investigators "spent hours inside and outside of a home in Peekskill." "At one point, investigators were seen removing several bags of evidence from the house," the New York-based local news service  added . According  to an  affidavit  filed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the suspect identified himself as Conor Brian Fitzpatrick and that he admitted to being the owner of the BreachForums website. "When I arrested the defendant on March 15, 2023, he stated to me in substance and in part that: a) his name was Conor Brian Fitzpatrick; b) he used the alias 'pompompurin,' and c) he was the owner and administrator of 'BreachForums,'&

U.S. government agencies have released a joint cybersecurity advisory detailing the indicators of compromise (IoCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the notorious  LockBit 3.0 ransomware . "The LockBit 3.0 ransomware operations function as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model and is a continuation of previous versions of the ransomware, LockBit 2.0, and LockBit," the authorities  said . The alert comes courtesy of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). Since emerging in late 2019, the  LockBit actors  have invested significant  technical efforts  to develop and fine-tune its malware, issuing two major updates — LockBit 2.0, released in mid-2021, and  LockBit 3.0 , released in June 2022. The two versions are also known as LockBit Red and LockBit Black, respectively. "LockBit 3.0 accepts addition

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Android voice phishing (aka vishing) malware campaign known as FakeCalls has reared its head once again to target South Korean users under the guise of over 20 popular financial apps. "FakeCalls malware possesses the functionality of a Swiss army knife, able not only to conduct its primary aim but also to extract private data from the victim's device," cybersecurity firm Check Point said . FakeCalls was previously documented by Kaspersky in April 2022, describing the malware's capabilities to imitate phone conversations with a bank customer support agent. In the observed attacks, users who install the rogue banking app are enticed into calling the financial institution by offering a fake low-interest loan. At the point where the phone call actually happens, a pre-recorded audio with instructions from the real bank is played. Simultaneously, the malware conceals the phone number with the bank's legitimate number to give the impression that a conversation

<details>

Think of the typical portrayal of a cyberattack. Bad guy pounding furiously on a keyboard, his eyes peeking out from under a dark hoodie. At long last, his efforts pay off and he hits the right combination of keys. "I'm in!" he shouts in triumph. Clearly, there are many problems with this scenario – and it's not just the hoodie. What's even more inaccurate is that most cyber attackers today do not rely on unsophisticated methods like brute force. Instead, they target users directly through social engineering, spearphishing and business email compromise (BEC). In light of this, it can be said that cybercriminals no longer break into corporate systems; instead, they log in with valid user credentials. In this landscape of highly targeted cyberattacks, the identity perimeter has emerged as a crucial battlefield. Unfortunately, too many businesses continue to rely on outdated security strategies and tools that leave their users and sensitive systems unprotected. S

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Golang-based botnet dubbed  HinataBot  has been observed to leverage known flaws to compromise routers and servers and use them to stage distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. "The malware binaries appear to have been named by the malware author after a character from the popular anime series, Naruto, with file name structures such as 'Hinata-<OS>-<Architecture>,'" Akamai  said  in a technical report. Among the methods used to distribute the malware are the exploitation of exposed Hadoop YARN servers and security flaws in Realtek SDK devices ( CVE-2014-8361 )and Huawei HG532 routers ( CVE-2017-17215 , CVSS score: 8.8). Unpatched vulnerabilities and weak credentials have been a low-hanging fruit for attackers, representing an easy, well-documented entry point that does not require sophisticated social engineering tactics or other methods. The threat actors behind HinataBot are said to have been active since at least December 2022, with the

In the modern corporate IT environment, which relies on cloud connectivity, global connections and large volumes of data, the browser is now the most important work interface. The browser connects employees to managed resources, devices to the web, and the on-prem environment to the cloud one. Yet, and probably unsurprisingly, this browser prominence has significantly increased the number of threats that adversaries target the browser with. Attackers are now leveraging the browser's core functionality - rendering and executing web pages for users to access - to perform attacks. The browser is now an attack surface, as well as an attack vector for malicious access to corporate SaaS and web applications through account takeover and the use of compromised credentials. To address this issue, a new guide was recently published ( Download Here ). It analyzes what a solution to these threats would look like.

Copycat websites for instant messaging apps like Telegram and WhatApp are being used to distribute trojanized versions and infect Android and Windows users with cryptocurrency clipper malware . "All of them are after victims' cryptocurrency funds, with several targeting cryptocurrency wallets," ESET researchers Lukáš Štefanko and Peter Strýček said in a new analysis. While the first instance of clipper malware on the Google Play Store dates back to 2019, the development marks the first time Android-based clipper malware has been built into instant messaging apps. "Moreover, some of these apps use optical character recognition (OCR) to recognize text from screenshots stored on the compromised devices, which is another first for Android malware," the Slovak cybersecurity firm added. The attack chain begins with unsuspecting users clicking on fraudulent ads on Google search results that lead to hundreds of sketchy YouTube channels, which then direct them

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The advanced persistent threat known as  Winter Vivern  has been linked to campaigns targeting government officials in India, Lithuania, Slovakia, and the Vatican since 2021. The activity targeted Polish government agencies, the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Italy Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and individuals within the Indian government, SentinelOne said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Of particular interest is the APT's targeting of private businesses, including telecommunications organizations that support Ukraine in the ongoing war," senior threat researcher Tom Hegel  said . Winter Vivern, also tracked as UAC-0114,  drew attention  last month after the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) detailed a new malware campaign aimed at state authorities of Ukraine and Poland to deliver a piece of malware dubbed Aperetif.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google is calling attention to a set of severe security flaws in Samsung's Exynos chips, some of which could be exploited remotely to completely compromise a phone without requiring any user interaction. The 18 zero-day vulnerabilities affect a wide range of Android smartphones from Samsung, Vivo, Google, wearables using the Exynos W920 chipset, and vehicles equipped with the Exynos Auto T5123 chipset. Four of the 18 flaws make it possible for a threat actor to achieve internet-to-Samsung, Vivo, and Google, as well as wearables using the Exynos W920 chipset and vehicleses in late 2022 and early 2023, said. "[The] four vulnerabilities allow an attacker to remotely compromise a phone at the baseband level with no user interaction, and require only that the attacker know the victim's phone number," Tim Willis, head of Google Project Zero,  said . In doing so, a threat actor could gain entrenched access to cellular information passing in and out of the targeted devi

Threat activity clusters affiliated with the Chinese and Russian cybercriminal ecosystems have been observed using a new piece of malware that's designed to load Cobalt Strike onto infected machines. Dubbed  SILKLOADER  by Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure, the malware leverages  DLL side-loading techniques  to deliver commercial adversary simulation software. The development comes as  improved detection capabilities  against Cobalt Strike, a legitimate post-exploitation tool used for red team operations, is forcing threat actors to  seek alternative options  or concoct new ways to propagate the framework to evade detection. "The most common of these include adding complexity to the auto-generated beacon or stager payloads via the utilization of packers, crypters, loaders, or similar techniques," WithSecure researchers  said . SILKLOADER joins other loaders such as KoboldLoader, MagnetLoader, and LithiumLoader that have been  recently discovered  incorporating

The cryptojacking group known as  TeamTNT  is suspected to be behind a previously undiscovered strain of malware used to mine Monero cryptocurrency on compromised systems. That's according to Cado Security, which  found  the  sample  after Sysdig detailed a sophisticated attack known as  SCARLETEEL  aimed at containerized environments to ultimately steal proprietary data and software. Specifically, the early phase of the attack chain involved the use of a cryptocurrency miner, which the cloud security firm suspected was deployed as a decoy to conceal the detection of data exfiltration. The artifact – uploaded to VirusTotal late last month – "bear[s] several syntactic and semantic similarities to prior TeamTNT payloads, and includes a wallet ID that has previously been attributed to them," a new analysis from Cado Security has  revealed .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coalition of law enforcement agencies across Europe and the U.S.  announced  the takedown of ChipMixer, an unlicensed cryptocurrency mixer that began its operations in August 2017. "The ChipMixer software blocked the blockchain trail of the funds, making it attractive for cybercriminals looking to launder illegal proceeds from criminal activities such as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, ransomware attacks, and payment card fraud," Europol  said  in a statement. The coordinated exercise, besides dismantling the clearnet and dark web websites associated with ChipMixer, also resulted in the seizure of $47.5 million in Bitcoin and 7 TB of data. Mixers, also called tumblers,  offer full anonymity  for a fee by commingling cryptocurrency from different users – both legitimate and criminally-derived funds – in a manner that makes it hard to trace the origins. This is achieved by funneling different payments into a single pool before splitting up each amount and transmit

In last year's edition of the  Security Navigator  we noted that the Manufacturing Industry appeared to be totally over-represented in our dataset of Cyber Extortion victims. Neither the number of businesses nor their average revenue particularly stood out to explain this. Manufacturing was also the most represented Industry in our CyberSOC dataset – contributing more Incidents than any other sector.  We found this trend confirmed in 2023 – so much in fact that we decided to take a closer look. So let's examine some possible explanations.  And debunk them. Hunting for possible explanations Manufacturing is still the most impacted industry in our Cyber Extortion dataset in 2023, as tracked by monitoring double-extortion leak sites. Indeed, this sector now represents more than 20% of all victims since we started observing the leak sites in the beginning of 2020. Approximately 28% of all our clients are from Manufacturing, contributing with an overall share of 31% of all p

Multiple threat actors, including a nation-state group, exploited a critical three-year-old security flaw in Progress Telerik to break into an unnamed federal entity in the U.S. The  disclosure  comes from a  joint advisory  issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). "Exploitation of this vulnerability allowed malicious actors to successfully execute remote code on a federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency's Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server," the agencies  said . The indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with the digital break-in were identified from November 2022 through early January 2023. Tracked as  CVE-2019-18935  (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue relates to a .NET  deserialization vulnerability  affecting Progress Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX that, if left unpatched, could  lead to remote code exec

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on March 15  added  a security vulnerability impacting Adobe ColdFusion to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. The critical flaw in question is  CVE-2023-26360  (CVSS score: 8.6), which could be exploited by a threat actor to achieve arbitrary code execution. "Adobe ColdFusion contains an improper access control vulnerability that allows for remote code execution," CISA  said . The vulnerability impacts ColdFusion 2018 (Update 15 and earlier versions) and ColdFusion 2021 (Update 5 and earlier versions). It has been addressed in versions Update 16 and Update 6, respectively, released on March 14, 2023. It's worth noting that CVE-2023-26360 also affects ColdFusion 2016 and ColdFusion 11 installations, both of which are no longer supported by the software company as they have  reached  end-of-life (EoL).

A previously undocumented threat actor dubbed  YoroTrooper  has been targeting government, energy, and international organizations across Europe as part of a cyber espionage campaign that has been active since at least June 2022. "Information stolen from successful compromises include credentials from multiple applications, browser histories and cookies, system information and screenshots," Cisco Talos researchers Asheer Malhotra and Vitor Ventura  said  in a Tuesday analysis. Prominent countries targeted include Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations. The threat actor is believed to be Russian-speaking owing to the victimology patterns and the presence of Cyrillic snippets in some of the implants. That said, the YoroTrooper intrusion set has been found to exhibit tactical overlaps with the  PoetRAT team  that was  documented  in 2020 as leveraging coronavirus-themed baits to strike government and ene

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered the first-ever illicit cryptocurrency mining campaign used to mint Dero since the start of February 2023. "The novel Dero cryptojacking operation concentrates on locating Kubernetes clusters with anonymous access enabled on a Kubernetes API and listening on non-standard ports accessible from the internet," CrowdStrike  said  in a new report shared with The Hacker News. The development marks a notable shift from Monero, which is a prevalent cryptocurrency used in such campaigns. It's suspected it may have to do with the fact that  Dero  "offers larger rewards and provides the same or better anonymizing features." The attacks, attributed to an unknown financially motivated actor, commence with scanning for Kubernetes clusters with authentication set as  --anonymous-auth=true , which allows anonymous requests to the server, to drop initial payloads from three different U.S.-based IP addresses.

The stakes could not be higher for cyber defenders. With the vast amounts of sensitive information, intellectual property, and financial data at risk, the consequences of a data breach can be devastating. According to a report released by  Ponemon institute , the cost of data breaches has reached an all-time high, averaging $4.35 million in 2022. Vulnerabilities in web applications are often the primary gateway for attackers. According to  a World Economic Forum report , just one week after discovering a critical security flaw in a widely used software library (Log4j), more than 100 attempts at exploiting the vulnerability were detected every minute. This illustrates how quickly malicious actors can take advantage of vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgency of regularly assessing and monitoring your system for any vulnerabilities or weak points. The complexity of addressing security challenges in today's digital world is further compounded by the rising use of open-source compo

A cyberespionage actor known as Tick has been attributed with high confidence to a compromise of an East Asian data-loss prevention (DLP) company that caters to government and military entities. "The attackers compromised the DLP company's internal update servers to deliver malware inside the software developer's network, and trojanized installers of legitimate tools used by the company, which eventually resulted in the execution of malware on the computers of the company's customers," ESET researcher Facundo Muñoz  said . Tick , also known as Bronze Butler, REDBALDKNIGHT , Stalker Panda, and Stalker Taurus, is a suspected China-aligned collective that has primarily gone after government, manufacturing, and biotechnology firms in Japan. It's said to be active  since at least 2006 . Other lesser-known targets include Russian, Singaporean, and Chinese enterprises.

Microsoft's Patch Tuesday update for March 2023 is rolling out with remediations for a set of  80 security flaws , two of which have come under active exploitation in the wild. Eight of the 80 bugs are rated Critical, 71 are rated Important, and one is rated Moderate in severity. The updates are in  addition to 29 flaws  the tech giant fixed in its Chromium-based Edge browser in recent weeks. The two vulnerabilities that have come under active attack include a Microsoft Outlook privilege escalation flaw ( CVE-2023-23397 , CVSS score: 9.8) and a Windows SmartScreen security feature bypass ( CVE-2023-24880 , CVSS score: 5.1). CVE-2023-23397 is "triggered when an attacker sends a message with an extended MAPI property with a UNC path to an SMB (TCP 445) share on a threat actor-controlled server," Microsoft  said  in a standalone advisory.

GoBruteforcer: New Golang-Based Malware Breaches Web Servers Via Brute-Force Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/gobruteforcer-new-golang-based-malware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Golang-based malware dubbed  GoBruteforcer  has been found targeting web servers running phpMyAdmin, MySQL, FTP, and Postgres to corral the devices into a botnet. "GoBruteforcer chose a Classless Inter-Domain Routing ( CIDR ) block for scanning the network during the attack, and it targeted all IP addresses within that CIDR range," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers  said . "The threat actor chose CIDR block scanning as a way to get access to a wide range of target hosts on different IPs within a network instead of using a single IP address as a target." The malware is mainly designed to single out Unix-like platforms running x86, x64 and ARM architectures, with GoBruteforcer attempting to obtain access via a brute-force attack using a list of credentials hard-coded into the binary. If the attack proves to be successful, an internet relay chat ( IRC ) bot is deployed on the victim server to establish communications with an actor-controlled server.

Today, the LockBit ransomware is the most active and successful cybercrime organization in the world. Attributed to a Russian Threat Actor, LockBit has stepped out from the shadows of the Conti ransomware group, who were disbanded in early 2022. LockBit ransomware was first discovered in September 2019 and was previously known as ABCD ransomware because of the ".abcd virus" extension first observed. LockBit operates as a Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model. In short, this means that affiliates make a deposit to use the tool, then split the ransom payment with the LockBit group. It has been reported that some affiliates are receiving a share as high of 75%. LockBit's operators have posted advertisements for their affiliate program on Russian-language criminal forums stating they will not operate in Russia or any CIS countries, nor will they work with English-speaking developers unless a Russian-speaking "guarantor" vouches for them.  Initial attack vectors of

An open source adversary-in-the-middle ( AiTM ) phishing kit has found a number of takers in the cybercrime world for its ability to orchestrate attacks at scale. Microsoft Threat Intelligence is tracking the threat actor behind the development of the kit under its emerging moniker  DEV-1101 . An  AiTM phishing attack  typically involves a threat actor attempting to steal and intercept a target's password and session cookies by deploying a proxy server between the user and the website. Such attacks are more effective owing to their ability to circumvent multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections. DEV-1101, per the tech giant, is said to be the party behind several phishing kits that can be purchased or rented by other criminal actors, thereby reducing the effort and resources required to launch a phishing campaign. "The availability of such phishing kits for purchase by attackers is part of the industrialization of the cybercriminal economy and lowers the barrier of

Fortinet FortiOS Flaw Exploited in Targeted Cyberattacks on Government Entities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/fortinet-fortios-flaw-exploited-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government entities and large organizations have been targeted by an unknown threat actor by exploiting a security flaw in Fortinet FortiOS software to result in data loss and OS and file corruption. "The complexity of the exploit suggests an advanced actor and that it is highly targeted at governmental or government-related targets," Fortinet researchers Guillaume Lovet and Alex Kong said in an advisory last week. The zero-day flaw in question is CVE-2022-41328 (CVSS score: 6.5), a medium security path traversal bug in FortiOS that could lead to arbitrary code execution. "An improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory vulnerability ('path traversal') [CWE-22] in FortiOS may allow a privileged attacker to read and write arbitrary files via crafted CLI commands," the company noted. The shortcoming impacts FortiOS versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.4.0 through 6.4.11, 7.0.0 through 7.0.9, and 7.2.0 through 7.2.3. Fixes are available in versions 6.4.1

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A widespread malicious cyber operation has hijacked thousands of websites aimed at East Asian audiences to redirect visitors to adult-themed content since early September 2022. The ongoing campaign entails injecting malicious JavaScript code to the hacked websites, often connecting to the target web server using legitimate FTP credentials the threat actor previously obtained via an unknown method. "In many cases, these were highly secure auto-generated FTP credentials which the attacker was somehow able to acquire and leverage for website hijacking," Wiz  said  in a report published this month. The fact that the breached websites – owned by both small firms and multinational corporations – utilize different tech stacks and hosting service providers has made it difficult to trace a common attack vector, the cloud security company noted. That having said, one of the common denominators between the websites is that a majority of them are either hosted in China or hosted in

A fake ChatGPT-branded Chrome browser extension has been found to come with capabilities to hijack Facebook accounts and create rogue admin accounts, highlighting one of the different methods cyber criminals are using to distribute malware. "By hijacking high-profile Facebook business accounts, the threat actor creates an elite army of Facebook bots and a malicious paid media apparatus," Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal  said  in a technical report. "This allows it to push Facebook paid ads at the expense of its victims in a self-propagating worm-like manner." The "Quick access to Chat GPT" extension, which is said to have attracted 2,000 installations per day since March 3, 2023, has since been pulled by Google from the Chrome Web Store as of March 9, 2023.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is one of the standard-bearers in global cybersecurity. The U.S.-based institute's cybersecurity framework helps organizations of all sizes understand, manage, and reduce their cyber-risk levels and better protect their data. Its importance in the fight against cyberattacks can't be overstated. While NIST hasn't directly developed standards related to securing the SaaS ecosystem, they are instrumental in the way we approach SaaS security. NIST recently released its  Guide to a Secure Enterprise Network Landscape . In it, they discuss the transformation from on-premise networks to multiple cloud servers. Access to these servers, and the accompanying SaaS apps, is through both secure and unsecured devices and locations across disparate geography. The move to the cloud has effectively obliterated the network perimeter. As a result, companies have increased their attack surface and are experiencing an escalation of attacks that

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors have been increasingly observed using AI-generated YouTube Videos to spread a variety of stealer malware such as Raccoon, RedLine, and Vidar. "The videos lure users by pretending to be tutorials on how to download cracked versions of software such as Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Autodesk 3ds Max, AutoCAD, and other products that are licensed products available only to paid users," CloudSEK researcher Pavan Karthick M  said . Just as the ransomware landscape comprises core developers and affiliates who are in charge of identifying potential targets and actually carrying out the attacks, the information stealer ecosystem also consists of threat actors known as  traffers  who are recruited to spread the malware using different methods. One of the popular malware distribution channels is YouTube, with CloudSEK witnessing a 200-300% month-over-month increase in videos containing links to stealer malware in the description section.

More than a dozen security flaws have been disclosed in E11, a smart intercom product made by Chinese company Akuvox . "The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to execute code remotely in order to activate and control the device's camera and microphone, steal video and images, or gain a network foothold," Claroty security researcher Vera Mens  said  in a technical write-up. Akuvox E11 is described by the company on its website as a " SIP  [Session Initiation Protocol] video doorphone specially designed for villas, houses, and apartments." The  product listing , however, has been taken down from the website, displaying an error message: "Page does not exist." A  snapshot  captured by Google shows that the page was live as recently as March 12, 2023, 05:59:51 GMT. The attacks can manifest either through remote code execution within the local area network (LAN) or remote activation of the E11's camera and microphone, allowing the adversary to c

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The  Dark Pink  advanced persistent threat (APT) actor has been linked to a fresh set of attacks targeting government and military entities in Southeast Asian countries with a malware called KamiKakaBot. Dark Pink, also called Saaiwc, was extensively profiled by Group-IB earlier this year, describing its use of custom tools such as TelePowerBot and KamiKakaBot to run arbitrary commands and exfiltrate sensitive information. The threat actor is suspected to be of Asia-Pacific origin and has been active since at least mid-2021, with an increased tempo observed in 2022. "The latest attacks, which took place in February 2023, were almost identical to previous attacks," Dutch cybersecurity company EclecticIQ  disclosed  in a new report published last week. "The main difference in the February campaign is that the malware's obfuscation routine has improved to better evade anti-malware measures." The attacks play out in the form of social engineering lures that

BATLOADER Malware Uses Google Ads to Deliver Vidar Stealer and Ursnif Payloads<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/batloader-malware-uses-google-ads-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The malware downloader known as BATLOADER has been observed  abusing Google Ads  to deliver secondary payloads like Vidar Stealer and Ursnif. According to cybersecurity company  eSentire , malicious ads are used to spoof a wide range of legitimate apps and services such as Adobe, OpenAPI's ChatGPT, Spotify, Tableau, and Zoom. BATLOADER , as the name suggests, is a loader that's responsible for distributing next-stage malware such as information stealers, banking malware, Cobalt Strike, and even ransomware. One of the key traits of the BATLOADER operations is the use of software impersonation tactics for malware delivery. This is achieved by setting up lookalike websites that host Windows installer files masquerading as legitimate apps to trigger the infection sequence when a user searching for the software clicks a rogue ad on the Google search results page. These MSI installer files, when launched, execute Python scripts that contain the BATLOADER payload to retrieve t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An updated version of a botnet malware called  Prometei  has infected more than 10,000 systems worldwide since November 2022. The infections are both geographically indiscriminate and opportunistic, with a majority of the victims reported in Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey. Prometei, first observed in 2016, is a modular botnet that features a large repertoire of components and several proliferation methods, some of which also include the  exploitation  of ProxyLogon Microsoft Exchange Server flaws. It's also notable for avoiding striking Russia, suggesting that the threat actors behind the operation are likely based in the country. The cross-platform botnet's motivations are financial, primarily leveraging its pool of infected hosts to mine cryptocurrency and harvest credentials. The latest variant of Prometei (called v3) improves upon its existing features to challenge forensic analysis and further burrow its access on victim machines, Cisco Talos  said  in a report share

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspecting China-linked hacking campaign has been observed targeting unpatched SonicWall  Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 appliances  to drop malware and establish long-term persistence. "The malware has functionality to steal user credentials, provide shell access, and persist through firmware upgrades," cybersecurity company Mandiant  said  in a technical report published this week. The Google-owned incident response and threat intelligence firm is tracking the activity under its uncategorized moniker  UNC4540 . The malware – a collection of bash scripts and a single ELF binary identified as a TinyShell backdoor – is engineered to grant the attacker privileged access to SonicWall devices. The overall objective behind the custom toolset appears to be credential theft, with the malware permitting the adversary to siphon cryptographically hashed credentials from all logged-in users. It further provides shell access to the compromised device. Mandiant also called out th

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coordinated international law enforcement exercise has taken down the online infrastructure associated with a cross-platform remote access trojan (RAT) known as NetWire . Coinciding with the seizure of the sales website www.worldwiredlabs[.]com, a Croatian national who is suspected to be the website's administrator has been arrested. While the suspect's name was not released, investigative journalist Brian Krebs  identified  Mario Zanko as the owner of the domain. "NetWire is a licensed commodity RAT offered in underground forums to non-technical users to carry out their own criminal activities," Europol's European Cybercrime Center (EC3)  said  in a tweet. Advertised  since   at least 2012 , the malware is typically distributed via  malspam campaigns  and gives a remote attacker complete control over a Windows, macOS, or Linux system. It also comes with password-stealing and keylogging capabilities. The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)  said  an investiga

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) has long ago become a standard security practice. With a wide consensus on its ability to fend off more than 99% percent of account takeover attacks, it's no wonder why security architects regard it as a must-have in their environments. However, what seems to be less known are the inherent coverage limitations of traditional MFA solutions. While compatible with RDP connection and local desktop logins,  they offer no protection to remote command line access tools like PsExec, Remote PowerShell and their likes. In practice, it means that workstations and servers remain as vulnerable to lateral movement, ransomware spread and other identity threats despite having a fully functioning MFA solution on. For the adversary it's just a matter of taking the command line path instead of the RDP to log in as if there was not protection installed at all. In this article we'll explore this blind spot, understand its root cause and implications, and view

A new variant of the Android banking trojan named Xenomorph has surfaced in the wild, latest findings from ThreatFabric reveal. Named " Xenomorph 3rd generation " by the Hadoken Security Group, the threat actor behind the operation, the updated version comes with new features that allow it to perform financial fraud in a seamless manner. "This new version of the malware adds many new capabilities to an already feature-rich Android banker, most notably the introduction of a very extensive runtime engine powered by Accessibility services, which is used by actors to implement a complete  ATS framework ," the Dutch security firm  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. Xenomorph  first came to light  a year ago in February 2022, when it was found to target 56 European banks through  dropper apps  published on the Google Play Store.

A North Korean espionage group tracked as  UNC2970  has been observed employing previously undocumented malware families as part of a spear-phishing campaign targeting U.S. and European media and technology organizations since June 2022. Google-owned Mandiant said the threat cluster shares "multiple overlaps" with a  long-running   operation   dubbed  " Dream Job " that employs job recruitment lures in email messages to trigger the infection sequence. UNC2970 is the new moniker designated by the threat intelligence firm to a set of North Korean cyber activity that maps to UNC577 (aka Temp.Hermit ), and which also comprises another nascent threat cluster tracked as UNC4034. The UNC4034 activity, as  documented  by Mandiant in September 2022, entailed the use of WhatsApp to socially engineer targets into downloading a  backdoor  called AIRDRY.V2 under the pretext of sharing a skills assessment test.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security vulnerabilities in remote desktop programs such as Sunlogin and AweSun are being exploited by threat actors to deploy the PlugX malware. AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC), in a  new analysis , said it marks the continued abuse of the flaws to deliver a variety of payloads on compromised systems. This  includes  the Sliver post-exploitation framework, XMRig cryptocurrency miner, Gh0st RAT, and Paradise ransomware. PlugX is the latest addition to this list. The  modular malware  has been extensively put to use by threat actors based in China, with new features continuously added to help perform system control and information theft. In the attacks observed by ASEC, successful exploitation of the flaws is followed by the execution of a PowerShell command that retrieves an executable and a DLL file from a remote server. This executable is a legitimate HTTP Server Service from cybersecurity company ESET, which is used to load the DLL file by means of a techniq

A previously known Windows-based ransomware strain known as IceFire has expanded its focus to target Linux enterprise networks belonging to several media and entertainment sector organizations across the world. The intrusions entail the exploitation of a recently disclosed deserialization vulnerability in IBM Aspera Faspex file-sharing software ( CVE-2022-47986 , CVSS score: 9.8), according to cybersecurity company SentinelOne. "This strategic shift is a significant move that aligns them with  other   ransomware  groups that also target Linux systems," Alex Delamotte, senior threat researcher at SentinelOne,  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. A majority of the attacks observed by SentinelOne have been directed against companies located in Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and the U.A.E., countries that are not typically targeted by organized ransomware crews.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Phishing, the theft of users' credentials or sensitive data using social engineering, has been a significant threat since the early days of the internet – and continues to plague organizations today,  accounting for more than 30% of all known breaches . And with the mass migration to remote working during the pandemic, hackers have ramped up their efforts to steal login credentials as they take advantage of the chaos and lack of in-person user verification.  This has led to the revival of the old-school technique of vishing, which, like phishing online, involves using social engineering over the phone to steal sensitive information. Vishing attacks have  been on the rise  as a result, with 69% of companies experiencing them in 2021, up from 54% in 2020. These attacks often take the form of job or tech support scams and can be incredibly convincing. In August 2020, the  FBI along with the CISA  issued a warning regarding remote users being targeted by attackers spoofing organizati

Iranian state-sponsored actors are continuing to engage in social engineering campaigns targeting researchers by impersonating a U.S. think tank. "Notably the targets in this instance were all women who are actively involved in political affairs and human rights in the Middle East region," Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company attributed the activity to a hacking group it tracks as  Cobalt Illusion , and which is also known by the names APT35, Charming Kitten, ITG18, Phosphorus, TA453, and Yellow Garuda. The targeting of academics, activists, diplomats, journalists, politicians, and researchers by the threat actor  has been   well-documented   over  the  years . The group is suspected to be operating on behalf of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and has exhibited a pattern of using fake personas to establish contact with individuals who are of strategic interest to the governmen

The infamous cryptocurrency miner group called 8220 Gang has been observed using a new crypter called ScrubCrypt to carry out cryptojacking operations. According to Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, the attack chain commences with successful exploitation of susceptible Oracle WebLogic servers to download a PowerShell script that contains ScrubCrypt. Crypters are a type of software that can encrypt, obfuscate, and manipulate malware with the goal of evading detection by security programs. ScrubCrypt, which is advertised for sale by its author, comes with features to bypass Windows Defender protections as well as check for the presence of debugging and virtual machine environments. "ScrubCrypt is a crypter used to secure applications with a unique BAT packing method," security researcher Cara Lin  said  in a technical report. "The encrypted data at the top can be split into four parts using backslash '\.'" The crypter, in the final stage, decodes and loads the

Fortinet has released fixes to  address 15 security flaws , including one critical vulnerability impacting FortiOS and FortiProxy that could enable a threat actor to take control of affected systems. The issue, tracked as  CVE-2023-25610 , is rated 9.3 out of 10 for severity and was internally discovered and reported by its security teams. "A buffer underwrite ('buffer underflow') vulnerability in FortiOS and FortiProxy administrative interface may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device and/or perform a DoS on the GUI, via specifically crafted requests," Fortinet  said  in an advisory. Underflow bugs , also called  buffer underruns , occur when the input data is shorter than the reserved space, causing unpredictable behavior or leakage of sensitive data from memory. Other possible consequences include memory corruption that could either be weaponized to induce a crash or execute arbitrary code. Fortinet said it's not

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A pair of severe security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the Jenkins open source automation server that could lead to code execution on targeted systems. The flaws, tracked as  CVE-2023-27898  and  CVE-2023-27905 , impact the Jenkins server and Update Center, and have been collectively christened  CorePlague  by cloud security firm Aqua. All versions of Jenkins versions prior to 2.319.2 are vulnerable and exploitable. "Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's Jenkins server, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the Jenkins server," the company said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The shortcomings are the result of how Jenkins processes plugins available from the  Update Center , thereby potentially enabling a threat actor to upload a plugin with a malicious payload and trigger a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As threats grow and attack surfaces get more complex, companies continue to struggle with the multitude of tools they utilize to handle endpoint security and management. This can leave gaps in an enterprise's ability to identify devices that are accessing the network and in ensuring that those devices are compliant with security policies. These gaps are often seen in outdated spreadsheets that are used to track and manage asset inventory, configurations, vulnerabilities, and more. Ultimately, this increases organizational risk while stifling efficiency and productivity. That's why unified security and endpoint management has gained ground, as noted in  Gartner's Hype Cycle for Endpoint Security, 2022 . As part of the market's need to gain a clearer, real-time picture of their devices and security posture, Syxsense launched its Enterprise platform last year to address the three key elements of endpoint management and security: vulnerabilities, patch, and compliance.

The North Korea-linked  Lazarus Group  has been observed weaponizing flaws in an undisclosed software to breach a financial business entity in South Korea twice within a span of a year. While the first attack in May 2022 entailed the use of a vulnerable version of a certificate software that's widely used by public institutions and universities, the re-infiltration in October 2022 involved the exploitation of a zero-day in the same program. Cybersecurity firm AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)  said  it's refraining from mentioning the software owing to the fact that "the vulnerability has not been fully verified yet and a software patch has not been released." The adversarial collective, after obtaining an initial foothold by an unknown method, abused the zero-day bug to perform lateral movement, shortly after which the AhnLab V3 anti-malware engine was disabled via a  BYOVD attack .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
High-profile government entities in Southeast Asia are the target of a cyber espionage campaign undertaken by a Chinese threat actor known as Sharp Panda since late last year. The intrusions are characterized by the use of a new version of the Soul modular framework, marking a departure from the group's attack chains observed in 2021. Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point  said  the "long-running" activities have historically singled out countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Sharp Panda was  first documented  by the firm in June 2021, describing it as a "highly-organized operation that placed significant effort into remaining under the radar." Interestingly, the use of the Soul backdoor was  detailed  by Broadcom's Symantec in October 2021 in connection to an unattributed espionage operation targeting defense, healthcare, and ICT sectors in Southeast Asia.

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new information stealer dubbed SYS01stealer targeting critical government infrastructure employees, manufacturing companies, and other sectors. "The threat actors behind the campaign are targeting Facebook business accounts by using Google ads and fake Facebook profiles that promote things like games, adult content, and cracked software, etc. to lure victims into downloading a malicious file," Morphisec said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The attack is designed to steal sensitive information, including login data, cookies, and Facebook ad and business account information." The Israeli cybersecurity company said the campaign was initially tied to a financially motivated cybercriminal operation  dubbed Ducktail  by Zscaler. However, WithSecure, which  first documented  the Ducktail activity cluster in July 2022, said the  two intrusion sets  are different from one another, indicating how the threat actors

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected Pakistan-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as  Transparent Tribe  has been linked to an ongoing cyber espionage campaign targeting Indian and Pakistani Android users with a backdoor called  CapraRAT . "Transparent Tribe distributed the Android CapraRAT backdoor via trojanized secure messaging and calling apps branded as MeetsApp and MeetUp," ESET  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. As many as 150 victims, likely with military or political leanings, are estimated to have been targeted, with the malware ( com.meetup.app ) available to download from fake websites that masquerade as the official distribution centers of these apps. It's being suspected that the targets are lured through a honeytrap romance scam wherein the threat actor approaches the victims via another platform and persuades them to install the malware-laced apps under the pretext of "secure" messaging and calling.

Investing in digital identity can improve security, increase clinical productivity, and boost healthcare's bottom line.  —  b y Gus Malezis, CEO of Imprivata Digitalization has created immeasurable opportunities for businesses over the past two decades. But the growth of hybrid work and expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) has outpaced traditional 'castle and moat' cybersecurity, introducing unprecedented vulnerabilities, especially in the healthcare industry. Although all organizations have important data to secure, healthcare holds some of the public's most sensitive personal health information (PHI) – not to mention insurance and financial data, as well.  We all expect this information to be secured and protected, especially with HIPAA laws in place. However, due to increasing IT fragmentation and the growing sophistication of cyberattacks, this is no longer guaranteed. In fact, the number of individuals affected by health data breaches in the U.S. since 2009 is

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An older version of Shein's  Android application  suffered from a bug that periodically captured and transmitted clipboard contents to a remote server. The Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team said it  discovered  the problem in  version 7.9.2  of the app that was released on December 16, 2021. The issue has since been addressed as of May 2022. Shein, originally named ZZKKO, is a Chinese online fast fashion retailer based in Singapore. The app, which is currently at version 9.0.0, has over 100 million downloads on the Google Play Store. The tech giant  said  it's not "specifically aware of any malicious intent behind the behavior," but noted that the function isn't necessary to perform tasks on the app. It further pointed out that launching the application after copying any content to the device clipboard automatically triggered an HTTP POST request containing the data to the server "api-service[.]shein[.]com."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The massive breach at LastPass was the result of one of its engineers failing to update Plex on their home computer, in what's a sobering reminder of the dangers of failing to keep software up-to-date. The embattled password management service last week  revealed  how unidentified actors leveraged information stolen from an earlier incident that took place prior to August 12, 2022, along with details "available from a third-party data breach and a vulnerability in a third-party media software package to launch a coordinated second attack" between August and October 2022. The intrusion ultimately enabled the adversary to steal partially encrypted password vault data and customer information. The second attack specifically singled out one of the four DevOps engineers, targeting their home computer with a keylogger malware to obtain the credentials and breach the cloud storage environment. This, in turn, is said to have been made possible by exploiting a nearly three-y

The elusive campaign, dubbed  Hiatus  by Lumen Black Lotus Labs, has been found to deploy two malicious binaries, a remote access trojan dubbed HiatusRAT and a  variant of tcpdump  that makes it possible to capture packet capture on the target device. "Once a targeted system is infected, HiatusRAT allows the threat actor to remotely interact with the system, and it utilizes prebuilt functionality [...] to convert the compromised machine into a covert proxy for the threat actor," the company  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The packet-capture binary enables the actor to monitor router traffic on ports associated with email and file-transfer communications." The threat cluster primarily singles out end-of-life (EoL) DrayTek Vigor router models 2960 and 3900, with approximately 100

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Deep fakes are expected to become a more prominent attack vector. Here's how to identify them. What are Deep Fakes? A deep fake is the act of maliciously replacing real images and videos with fabricated ones to perform information manipulation. To create images, video and audio that are high quality enough to be used in deep fakes, AI and ML are required. Such use of AI, ML and image replacement are unlike other types of information manipulation, which use less extreme manipulation techniques, like misrepresentation of information, isolating parts of the information or editing it in a deceptive manner. Etay Maor, Senior Director of Security Strategy at Cato Networks adds "To add complications, the recent advancements and accessibility to AI generated text, such as GPT3, have already been used in combination with deepfakes (as a proof of concept) to create interactive, human looking conversation bots" What Do Deep Fakes Look Like?

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Law enforcement authorities from Germany and Ukraine have targeted suspected core members of a cybercrime group that has been behind large-scale attacks using DoppelPaymer ransomware. The operation, which took place on February 28, 2023, was carried out with support from the Dutch National Police (Politie) and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), according to Europol. This encompassed a raid of a German national's house as well as searches in the Ukrainian cities of Kiev and Kharkiv. A Ukrainian national was also interrogated. Both individuals are believed to have taken up crucial positions in the DoppelPaymer group. "Forensic analysis of the seized equipment is still ongoing to determine the exact role of the suspects and their links to other accomplices," the agency further  said . DoppelPaymer , according to cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, emerged in April 2019 and shares most of its code with another ransomware strain known as BitPaymer, which is attri

Experts Reveal Google Cloud Platform's Blind Spot for Data Exfiltration Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/experts-reveal-google-cloud-platforms.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors can take advantage of "insufficient" forensic visibility into Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to exfiltrate sensitive data, a new research has found. "Unfortunately, GCP does not provide the level of visibility in its storage logs that is needed to allow any effective forensic investigation, making organizations blind to potential data exfiltration attacks," cloud incident response firm Mitiga  said  in a report. The attack banks on the prerequisite that the adversary is able to gain control of an identity and access management (IAM) entity in the targeted organization by methods like social engineering to access the GCP environment. The crux of the problem is that GCP's  storage access logs  do not provide adequate transparency with regards to potential file access and read events, instead grouping them all as a single "Object Get" activity. "The same event is used for a wide variety of types of access, including: Reading a fil

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of researchers has revealed what it says is a vulnerability in a specific implementation of  CRYSTALS-Kyber , one of the encryption algorithms chosen by the U.S. government as quantum-resistant last year. The exploit relates to "side-channel attacks on up to the fifth-order masked implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber in ARM Cortex-M4 CPU," Elena Dubrova, Kalle Ngo, and Joel Gärtner of KTH Royal Institute of Technology  said  in a paper. CRYSTALS-Kyber is one of four post-quantum algorithms  selected  by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) after a rigorous multi-year effort to identify the next-generation encryption standards that can withstand huge leaps in computing power. A side-channel attack, as the name implies, involves extracting secrets from a cryptosystem through measurement and analysis of physical parameters. Some examples of such parameters include supply current, execution time, and electromagnetic emission. The underlying id

This past January, a SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) company named Wing Security (Wing) made waves with the  launch of its free SaaS-Shadow IT discovery solution . Cloud-based companies were invited to gain insight into their employees' SaaS usage through a completely free, self-service product that operates on a "freemium" model. If a user is impressed with the solution and wants to gain more insights or take remediation action, they can purchase the enterprise solution. "In today's economic reality, security budgets have not necessarily been cut down, but buyers are far more careful in their purchasing decisions and rightfully so. We believe that you cannot secure what you do not know, so knowing should be a basic commodity. Once you understand the magnitude of your SaaS attack layer, you can make an educated decision as to how you are going to solve it.

A new ATM malware strain dubbed  FiXS  has been observed targeting Mexican banks since the start of February 2023. "The ATM malware is hidden inside another not-malicious-looking program," Latin American cybersecurity firm Metabase Q  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. Besides requiring interaction via an external keyboard, the Windows-based ATM malware is also vendor-agnostic and is capable of infecting any teller machine that supports  CEN/XFS  (short for eXtensions for Financial Services). The exact mode of compromise remains unknown but Metabase Q's Dan Regalado told The Hacker News that it's likely that "attackers found a way to interact with the ATM via touchscreen." FiXS is also said to be similar to another strain of  ATM malware  codenamed  Ploutus  that has enabled cybercriminals to extract cash from ATMs by using an external keyboard or by  sending an SMS message . One of the notable characteristics of FiXS is its ability to disp

A pair of serious security defects has been disclosed in the Trusted Platform Module ( TPM ) 2.0 reference library specification that could potentially lead to information disclosure or privilege escalation. One of the vulnerabilities,  CVE-2023-1017 , concerns an out-of-bounds write, while the other,  CVE-2023-1018 , is described as an out-of-bounds read. Credited with discovering and reporting the issues in November 2022 is cybersecurity company Quarkslab. "These vulnerabilities can be triggered from user-mode applications by sending malicious commands to a TPM 2.0 whose firmware is based on an affected TCG reference implementation," the Trusted Computing Group (TCG)  said  in an advisory. Large tech vendors, organizations using enterprise computers, servers, IoT devices, and embedded systems that include a TPM can be impacted by the flaws, Quarkslab  noted , adding they "could affect billions of devices."

Chinese Hackers Targeting European Entities with New MQsTTang Backdoor<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/chinese-hackers-targeting-european.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The China-aligned Mustang Panda actor has been observed using a hitherto unseen custom backdoor called  MQsTTang  as part of an ongoing social engineering campaign that commenced in January 2023. "Unlike most of the group's malware, MQsTTang doesn't seem to be based on existing families or publicly available projects," ESET researcher Alexandre Côté Cyr  said  in a new report. Attack chains orchestrated by the group have stepped up targeting of European entities in the wake of  Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine  last year. The victimology of the current activity is unclear, but the Slovak cybersecurity company said the decoy filenames are in line with the group's previous campaigns that target European political organizations. That said, ESET also observed attacks against unknown entities in Bulgaria and Australia, as well as a governmental institution in Taiwan, indicating focus on Europe and Asia. Mustang Panda has a  history  of using a  remote

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has  released  a new advisory about  Royal ransomware , which emerged in the threat landscape last year. "After gaining access to victims' networks, Royal actors disable antivirus software and exfiltrate large amounts of data before ultimately deploying the ransomware and encrypting the systems," CISA  said . The custom  ransomware program , which has targeted U.S. and international organizations since September 2022, is believed to have evolved from earlier iterations that were dubbed Zeon.  What's more, it's said to be  operated  by seasoned threat actors who used to be part of Conti Team One, cybersecurity company Trend Micro disclosed in December 2022. The ransomware group employs call back phishing as a means of delivering their ransomware to victims, a technique  widely adopted  by criminal groups that splintered from the Conti enterprise last year following its shutdown.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A sophisticated attack campaign dubbed  SCARLETEEL  is targeting containerized environments to perpetrate theft of proprietary data and software. "The attacker exploited a containerized workload and then leveraged it to perform privilege escalation into an AWS account in order to steal proprietary software and credentials," Sysdig  said  in a new report. The advanced cloud attack also entailed the deployment of crypto miner software, which the cybersecurity company said is either an attempt to generate illicit profits or a ploy to distract defenders and throw them off the trail. The initial infection vector banked on exploiting a vulnerable public-facing service in a self-managed Kubernetes cluster hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Upon gaining a successful foothold, an XMRig crypto miner was launched and a bash script was used to obtain credentials that could be used to further burrow into the AWS cloud infrastructure and exfiltrate sensitive data.

New Cryptojacking Campaign Leverages Misconfigured Redis Database Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/new-cryptojacking-campaign-leverages.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Misconfigured Redis database servers are the target of a novel cryptojacking campaign that leverages a legitimate and open source command-line file transfer service to implement its attack. "Underpinning this campaign was the use of transfer[.]sh," Cado Security  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "It's possible that it's an attempt at evading detections based on other common code hosting domains (such as pastebin[.]com)." The cloud cybersecurity firm said the command line interactivity associated with transfer[.]sh has made it an ideal tool for hosting and delivering malicious payloads. The attack chain commences with targeting insecure Redis deployments, followed by registering a  cron job  that leads to arbitrary code execution when parsed by the scheduler. The job is designed to retrieve a payload hosted at transfer[.]sh. It's worth noting that  similar   attack mechanisms  have been employed by other threat actors like TeamTNT and

As a primary working interface, the browser plays a significant role in today's corporate environment. The browser is constantly used by employees to access websites, SaaS applications and internal applications, from both managed and unmanaged devices. A new report published by LayerX, a browser security vendor, finds that attackers are exploiting this reality and are targeting it in increasing numbers ( download report here ). The key report findings  Over half of all the browsers in the enterprise environment are misconfigured.  While a configured browser is nearly impossible to compromise, stealing data from misconfigured browsers is like taking candy from a baby. The Leading misconfigurations are improper use of personal browser profiles on work devices (29%), poor patching routine (50%), and the use of corporate browser profiles on unmanaged devices. 3 of every 10 SaaS applications are non-corporate shadow SaaS,  and no SaaS discovery/security solution can address its ris

The threat actor known as  Lucky Mouse  has developed a Linux version of a malware toolkit called SysUpdate, expanding on its ability to target devices running the operating system. The oldest version of the updated artifact dates back to July 2022, with the malware incorporating new features designed to evade security software and resist reverse engineering. Cybersecurity company Trend Micro  said  it observed the equivalent Windows variant in June 2022, nearly one month after the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure was set up. Lucky Mouse is also  tracked  under the monikers APT27, Bronze Union, Emissary Panda, and Iron Tiger, and is known to utilize a variety of malware such as  SysUpdate , HyperBro, PlugX, and a Linux backdoor dubbed rshell. Over the past two years, campaigns orchestrated by the threat group have embraced supply chain compromises of legitimate apps like  Able Desktop  and  MiMi Chat  to obtain remote access to compromised systems.

Cisco on Wednesday rolled out  security updates  to address a critical flaw impacting its IP Phone 6800, 7800, 7900, and 8800 Series products. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-20078, is rated 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS scoring system and is described as a command injection bug in the web-based management interface arising due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Successful exploitation of the bug could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with the highest privileges on the underlying operating system. "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface," Cisco  said  in an alert published on March 1, 2023. Also patched by the company is a high-severity denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability affecting the same set of devices, as well as the Cisco Unified IP Conference Phone 8831 and Unified IP Phone 7900 Series.

Six different law firms were targeted in January and February 2023 as part of two disparate threat campaigns distributing  GootLoader  and  FakeUpdates  (aka SocGholish) malware strains. GootLoader , active since late 2020, is a first-stage downloader that's capable of delivering a wide range of secondary payloads such as Cobalt Strike and ransomware. It notably  employs  search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning to funnel victims searching for business-related documents toward drive-by download sites that drop the JavaScript malware. In the  campaign  detailed by cybersecurity company eSentire, the threat actors are said to have compromised legitimate, but vulnerable, WordPress websites and added new blog posts without the owners' knowledge.

A stealthy Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) bootkit called BlackLotus has become the first publicly known malware capable of bypassing Secure Boot defenses, making it a potent threat in the cyber landscape. "This bootkit can run even on fully up-to-date Windows 11 systems with UEFI Secure Boot enabled," Slovak cybersecurity company ESET  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. UEFI bootkits  are deployed in the system firmware and allow full control over the operating system (OS) boot process, thereby making it possible to disable OS-level security mechanisms and deploy arbitrary payloads during startup with high privileges. Offered for sale at $5,000 (and $200 per new subsequent version), the powerful and persistent toolkit is programmed in Assembly and C and is 80 kilobytes in size. It also features geofencing capabilities to avoid infecting computers in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine. Details about BlackLotus  f

Employee well-being has become a primary focus for many businesses. Even before the pandemic, the C-suite was acutely aware of how employee mental health impacts business outcomes.  But for cybersecurity professionals, stress has always been a part of the job. A  new survey  revealed that one of the most concerning aspects of employee mental health is how it impacts cybersecurity programs and, more broadly, a business' ability to protect itself from cyberattacks. CISOs and their teams appear to be taking the brunt of unmitigated work-related stress levels and it's affecting the entire organization.  CISOs at small to midsize businesses with teams of five employees or fewer were surveyed to better understand how work-related stress is impacting CISOs – from their ability to do their job and lead their team to how it's affecting their own professional outlook and personal life. Here's what the survey results revealed.  The Impact of CISO Work-Stress Levels on Small

Gmail and Google Calendar Now Support Client-Side Encryption (CSE) to Boost Data Privacy<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/gmail-and-google-calendar-now-support.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has announced the general availability of client-side encryption (CSE) for Gmail and Calendar, months after  piloting the feature  in late 2022. The data privacy controls enable "even more organizations to become arbiters of their own data and the sole party deciding who has access to it," Google's Ganesh Chilakapati and Andy Wen  said . To that end, users can send and receive emails or create meeting events within their organizations or to other external parties in a manner that's encrypted "before it reaches Google servers." The company is also making available a  decrypter tool  in beta for Windows to decrypt client-side encrypted files and emails exported via its Data Export tool or Google Vault. macOS and Linux versions of the decrypter are expected to be released in the future. The development follows the  rollout of CSE  to other products such as Google Drive, Docs, Slides, Sheets, and Meet. The solution, the tech behemoth said, is aimed

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cryptocurrency companies are being targeted as part of a new campaign that delivers a remote access trojan called Parallax RAT. The malware "uses injection techniques to hide within legitimate processes, making it difficult to detect," Uptycs  said  in a new report. "Once it has been successfully injected, attackers can interact with their victim via Windows Notepad that likely serves as a communication channel." Parallax RAT  grants attackers remote access to victim machines. It comes with features to upload and download files as well as record keystrokes and screen captures. It has been put to use since early 2020 and was  previously delivered  via COVID-19-themed lures. In February 2022, Proofpoint  detailed  an activity cluster dubbed TA2541 targeting aviation, aerospace, transportation, manufacturing, and defense industries using different RATs, including Parallax. The first payload is a Visual C++ malware that employs the  process hollowing  technique to

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender has  released  a free decryptor for a new ransomware strain known as  MortalKombat . MortalKombat is a new ransomware strain that emerged in January 2023. It's based on commodity ransomware dubbed Xorist and has been observed in attacks targeting entities in the U.S., the Philippines, the U.K., and Turkey. Xorist , detected since 2010, is distributed as a ransomware builder, allowing cyber threat actors to create and customize their own version of the malware. This includes the ransom note, the file name of the ransom note, the list of file extensions targeted, the wallpaper to be used, and the extension to be used on encrypted files. MortalKombat notably was deployed in recent attacks mounted by an unnamed financially motivated threat actor as a part of a phishing campaign aimed at a wide range of organizations.

A new post-exploitation framework called EXFILTRATOR-22 (aka EX-22) has emerged in the wild with the goal of deploying ransomware within enterprise networks while flying under the radar. "It comes with a wide range of capabilities, making post-exploitation a cakewalk for anyone purchasing the tool," CYFIRMA  said  in a new report. Some of the notable features include establishing a reverse shell with elevated privileges, uploading and downloading files, logging keystrokes, launching ransomware to encrypt files, and starting a live VNC (Virtual Network Computing) session for real-time access. It's also equipped to persist after system reboots, perform lateral movement via a worm, view running processes, generate cryptographic hashes of files, and extract authentication tokens. The cybersecurity firm assessed with moderate confidence that threat actors responsible for creating the malware are operating from North, East, or Southeast Asia and are likely former affiliat

As digital transformation takes hold and businesses become increasingly reliant on digital services, it has become more important than ever to secure applications and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). With that said, application security and API security are two critical components of a comprehensive security strategy. By utilizing these practices, organizations can protect themselves from malicious attacks and security threats, and most importantly, ensure their data remains secure. Interestingly enough, despite the clear advantages these disciplines provide, businesses are struggling to understand which security approach is best for their needs. So in this article, we'll discuss the differences between application and API security, best practices that you should consider, and ultimately make the case for why you need both.  What is Application Security Application security, better known as AppSec, is a critical aspect of any organization's cybersecurity strategy.

The threat actor known as Blind Eagle has been linked to a new campaign targeting various key industries in Colombia. The activity, which was detected by the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team on February 20, 2023, is also said to encompass Ecuador, Chile, and Spain, suggesting a slow expansion of the hacking group's victimology footprint. Targeted entities include health, financial, law enforcement, immigration, and an agency in charge of peace negotiation in Colombia, the Canadian cybersecurity company said. Blind Eagle, also known as  APT-C-36 , was  recently covered  by Check Point Research, detailing the adversary's advanced toolset comprising Meterpreter payloads that are delivered via spear-phishing emails. The latest set of attacks involves the group impersonating the Colombian government tax agency, the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs (DIAN), to phish its targets using lures that urge recipients to settle "outstanding obligations."

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has  added  a high-severity flaw affecting the ZK Framework to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog based on evidence of active exploitation. Tracked as  CVE-2022-36537  (CVSS score: 7.5), the issue impacts ZK Framework versions 9.6.1, 9.6.0.1, 9.5.1.3, 9.0.1.2, and 8.6.4.1, and allows threat actors to retrieve sensitive information via specially crafted requests. "The ZK Framework is an open source Java framework," CISA  said . "This vulnerability can impact multiple products, including but not limited to ConnectWise R1Soft Server Backup Manager." The  vulnerability  was patched in May 2022 in versions 9.6.2, 9.6.0.2, 9.5.1.4, 9.0.1.3, and 8.6.4.2. As  demonstrated  by Huntress in a proof-of-concept (PoC) in October 2022, the vulnerability can be weaponized to bypass authentication, upload a backdoored JDBC database driver to gain code execution, and deploy ransomware on susceptible

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
LastPass, which in December 2022 disclosed a severe data breach that allowed threat actors to access encrypted password vaults, said it happened as a result of the same adversary launching a second attack on its systems. The company said one of its DevOps engineers had their personal home computer breached and infected with a keylogger as part of a sustained cyber attack that exfiltrated sensitive data from its Amazon AWS cloud storage servers. "The threat actor leveraged information stolen during the first incident, information available from a third-party data breach, and a vulnerability in a third-party media software package to launch a coordinated second attack," the password management service  said . This intrusion targeted the company's infrastructure, resources, and one of its employees from August 12, 2022 to October 26, 2022. The original incident, on the other hand, ended on August 12, 2022. The  August breach  saw the intruders accessing source code and

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The RIG exploit kit (EK) touched an all-time high successful exploitation rate of nearly 30% in 2022, new findings reveal. "RIG EK is a financially-motivated program that has been active since 2014," Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT  said  in an exhaustive report shared with The Hacker News. "Although it has yet to substantially change its exploits in its more recent activity, the type and version of the malware they distribute constantly change. The frequency of updating samples ranges from weekly to daily updates." Exploit kits are programs used to distribute malware to large numbers of victims by taking advantage of known security flaws in commonly-used software such as web browsers. The fact that  RIG EK  runs as a service model means threat actors can financially compensate the RIG EK administrator for installing malware of their choice on victim machines. The RIG EK operators primarily employ malvertising to ensure a high infection rate and large-scale

Spoiler Alert: Organizations with 10,000 SaaS users that use M365 and Google Workspace average over 4,371 additional connected apps. SaaS-to-SaaS (third-party) app installations are growing  nonstop  at organizations around the world. When an employee needs an additional app to increase their efficiency or productivity, they rarely think twice before installing. Most employees don't even realize that this SaaS-to-SaaS connectivity, which requires scopes like the ability to read, update, create, and delete content, increases their organization's attack surface in a significant way. Third-party app connections typically take place outside the view of the security team, are not vetted to understand the level of risk they pose. Adaptive Shield's latest report,  Uncovering the Risks & Realities of Third-Party Connected Apps , dives into the data on this topic.

A new ChromeLoader malware campaign has been observed being distributed via virtual hard disk (VHD) files, marking a deviation from the ISO optical disc image format. "These VHD files are being distributed with filenames that make them appear like either hacks or cracks for Nintendo and Steam games," AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC)  said  in a report last week. ChromeLoader  (aka Choziosi Loader or ChromeBack) originally surfaced in January 2022 as a browser-hijacking credential stealer but has since evolved into a more potent,  multifaceted   threat  capable of stealing sensitive data, deploying ransomware, and even dropping  decompression bombs . The primary goal of the malware is to  compromise  web browsers like Google Chrome, and modify the browser settings to intercept and direct traffic to dubious advertising websites. What's more, ChromeLoader has emerged as a conduit to  carry out click fraud  by leveraging a browser extension to monetize cl

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government entities in Asia-Pacific and North America are being targeted by an unknown threat actor with an off-the-shelf malware downloader known as PureCrypter to deliver an array of information stealers and ransomware. "The PureCrypter campaign uses the domain of a compromised non-profit organization as a command-and-control (C2) to deliver a secondary payload," Menlo Security researcher Abhay Yadav  said . The different types of malware propagated using PureCrypter include  RedLine Stealer ,  Agent Tesla ,  Eternity ,  Blackmoon  (aka  KRBanker ), and  Philadelphia  ransomware. First documented in June 2022, PureCrypter is  advertised  for sale by its author for $59 for one-month access (or $245 for a one-off lifetime purchase) and is capable of distributing a multitude of malware. In December 2022, PureCoder – the developer behind the program –  expanded  the slate of offerings to include a logger and information stealer known as PureLogs, which is designed to si

The  PlugX  remote access trojan has been observed masquerading as an open source Windows debugger tool called x64dbg in an attempt to circumvent security protections and gain control of a target system. "This file is a legitimate open-source debugger tool for Windows that is generally used to examine kernel-mode and user-mode code, crash dumps, or CPU registers," Trend Micro researchers Buddy Tancio, Jed Valderama, and Catherine Loveria  said  in a report published last week. PlugX, also known as  Korplug , is a post-exploitation  modular implant , which, among other things, is known for its multiple functionalities such as data exfiltration and its ability to use the compromised machine for nefarious purposes. Although first documented a decade ago in 2012, early samples of the malware date as far as February 2008, according to a  Trend Micro report  at the time. Over the years, PlugX has been used by threat actors with a Chinese nexus as well as cybercrime groups. On

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Dutch police announced the arrest of three individuals in connection with a "large-scale" criminal operation involving data theft, extortion, and money laundering. The suspects include two 21-year-old men from Zandvoort and Rotterdam and an 18-year-old man without a permanent residence. The arrests were made on January 23, 2023. It's estimated that the hackers stole personal data belonging to tens of millions of individuals. This comprised names, addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, credit cards, passwords, license plates, social security numbers, and passport details. The Politie said its cybercrime team started the investigation nearly two years ago, in March 2021, after a large Dutch company suffered a security breach. The name of the company was not disclosed but some of the firms that were hit by a cyber attack around that time included  RDC ,  Shell , and  Ticketcounter , the last of which was also a victim of an extortion att

Google Teams Up with Ecosystem Partners to Enhance Security of SoC Processors<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/google-teams-up-with-ecosystem-partners.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google said it's working with ecosystem partners to harden the security of firmware that interacts with Android. While the Android operating system runs on what's called the application processor (AP), it's just one of the many processors of a system-on-chip ( SoC ) that cater to various tasks like cellular communications and multimedia processing. "Securing the Android Platform requires going beyond the confines of the Application Processor," the Android team  said . "Android's defense-in-depth strategy also applies to the firmware running on  bare-metal environments  in these microcontrollers, as they are a critical part of the attack surface of a device." The tech giant said the goal is to bolster the security of software running on these secondary processors (i.e., firmware) and make it harder to exploit vulnerabilities over the air to achieve remote code execution within the Wi-Fi SoC or the cellular baseband. To that end, Google noted tha

The use of AI in cybersecurity is growing rapidly and is having a significant impact on threat detection, incident response, fraud detection, and vulnerability management. According to a report by Juniper Research, the use of AI for fraud detection and prevention is expected to save businesses $11 billion annually by 2023. But how to integrate AI into business cybersecurity infrastructure without being exposed to hackers? In terms of detecting and responding to security threats in a more efficient and effective manner, AI has been helping businesses in lots of ways.  Firstly, it can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns or anomalies much faster and with greater accuracy than humans. AI detects and responds to security threats in real-time, reducing the time it takes to identify and remediate security incidents. The algorithms can learn from past incidents and adapt to new threats as they emerge. With it, cybersecurity systems can become smarter and more effective ove

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging organizations and individuals to increase their cyber vigilance, as Russia's military invasion of Ukraine officially  enters one year .

An investigation into data safety labels for Android apps available on the Google Play Store has uncovered "serious loopholes" that allow apps to provide misleading or outright false information. The  study , conducted by the Mozilla Foundation as part of its  *Privacy Not Included  initiative, compared the privacy policies and labels of the 20 most popular paid apps and the 20 most popular free apps on the app marketplace. It  found  that, in roughly 80% of the apps reviewed, "the labels were false or misleading based on discrepancies between the apps' privacy policies and the information apps self-reported on Google's  Data safety form ." "The apps aren't self-reporting accurately enough to give the public any meaningful reassurance about the safety and privacy of their data," Mozilla further said, adding consumers are being led to "believe these apps are doing a better job protecting their privacy than they are."

Trojanized versions of legitimate applications are being used to deploy evasive cryptocurrency mining malware on macOS systems. Jamf Threat Labs, which made the discovery, said the XMRig coin miner was executed as Final Cut Pro, a video editing software from Apple, which contained an unauthorized modification. "This malware makes use of the Invisible Internet Project (i2p) [...] to download malicious components and send mined currency to the attacker's wallet," Jamf researchers Matt Benyo, Ferdous Saljooki, and Jaron Bradley  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. An earlier iteration of the campaign was  documented  exactly a year ago by Trend Micro, which pointed out the malware's use of i2p to conceal network traffic and speculated that it may have been delivered as a DMG file for Adobe Photoshop CC 2019.  The Apple device management company said the source of the cryptojacking apps can be traced to Pirate Bay, with the earliest uploads dating all the

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple threat actors have been observed opportunistically weaponizing a now-patched critical security vulnerability impacting several Zoho ManageEngine products since January 20, 2023. Tracked as  CVE-2022-47966  (CVSS score: 9.8), the  remote code execution flaw  allows a complete takeover of the susceptible systems by unauthenticated attackers. As many as  24 different products , including Access Manager Plus, ADManager Plus, ADSelfService Plus, Password Manager Pro, Remote Access Plus, and Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM), are affected by the issue. The shortcoming "allows unauthenticated remote code execution due to usage of an outdated third-party dependency for XML signature validation, Apache Santuario," Bitdefender's Martin Zugec  said  in a technical advisory shared with The Hacker News. According to the Romanian cybersecurity firm, the exploitation efforts are said to have commenced the day after penetration testing firm Horizon3.ai released a proo

The (Other) Risk in Finance A few years ago, a Washington-based real estate developer received a document link from First American – a financial services company in the real estate industry – relating to a deal he was working on. Everything about the document was perfectly fine and normal. The odd part, he  told  a reporter, was that if he changed a single digit in the URL, suddenly, he could see somebody else's document. Change it again, a different document. With no technical tools or expertise, the developer could retrieve FirstAm records dating back to 2003 – 885  million  in total, many containing the kinds of sensitive data disclosed in real estate dealings, like bank details, social security numbers, and of course, names and addresses. That nearly a billion records could leak from so simple a web vulnerability seemed shocking. Yet even more severe consequences befall financial services companies every week.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Materials research organizations in Asia have been targeted by a previously unknown threat actor using a distinct set of tools. Symantec, by Broadcom Software, is tracking the cluster under the moniker  Clasiopa . The origins of the hacking group and its affiliations are currently unknown, but there are hints that suggest the adversary could have ties to India. This includes references to "SAPTARISHI-ATHARVAN-101" in a custom backdoor and the use of the password "iloveindea1998^_^" for a ZIP archive. It's worth noting that  Saptarishi , meaning "Seven sages" in Sanskrit, refers to a group of seers who are revered in Hindu literature.  Atharvan  was an ancient Hindu priest and is believed to have co-authored one of the four  Vedas , a collection of religious scriptures in Hinduism. "While these details could suggest that the group is based in India, it is also quite likely that the information was planted as false flags, with the password in

A new backdoor associated with a malware downloader named  Wslink  has been discovered, with the tool likely used by the notorious North Korea-aligned Lazarus Group, new findings reveal.

Its other features comprise listing active sessions, creating and terminating processes, enumerating drives, and compressing directories. Wslink was  first documented  by the Slovak cybersecurity firm in October 2021, describing it as a "simple yet remarkable" malware loader that's capable of executing received modules in memory. "The Wslink payload can be leveraged later for lateral movement, due to its specific interest in network sessions," ESET researcher Vladislav Hrčka  said .

"Once infected, S1deload Stealer steals user credentials, emulates human behavior to artificially boost videos and other content engagement, assesses the value of individual accounts (such as identifying corporate social media admins), mines for BEAM cryptocurrency, and propagates the malicious link to the user's followers," Bitdefender researcher Dávid ÁCS  said . Put differently, the goal of the campaign is to take control of the users' Facebook and YouTube accounts and rent out access to raise view counts and likes for videos and posts shared on the platforms.

Apple Warns of 3 New Vulnerabilities Affecting iPhone, iPad, and Mac Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/apple-warns-of-3-new-vulnerabilities.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple has revised the  security advisories  it released last month to include three new vulnerabilities impacting  iOS, iPadOS , and  macOS . The first flaw is a  race condition  in the Crash Reporter component (CVE-2023-23520) that could enable a malicious actor to read arbitrary files as root. The iPhone maker said it addressed the issue with additional validation. The two other vulnerabilities, credited to Trellix researcher Austin Emmitt, reside in the  Foundation framework  (CVE-2023-23530 and CVE-2023-23531) and could be weaponized to achieve code execution. "An app may be able to execute arbitrary code out of its sandbox or with certain elevated privileges," Apple said, adding it patched the issues with "improved memory handling." The medium to high-severity vulnerabilities have been patched in iOS 16.3, iPadOS 16.3, and macOS Ventura 13.2 that were shipped on January 23, 2023. Trellix, in its own report on Tuesday,  classified  the two flaws as a &qu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's a continuing assault on the open source ecosystem,  over 15,000 spam packages  have flooded the npm repository in an attempt to distribute phishing links. "The packages were created using automated processes, with project descriptions and auto-generated names that closely resembled one another," Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb  said  in a Tuesday report. "The attackers referred to retail websites using referral IDs, thus profiting from the referral rewards they earned." The modus operandi involves poisoning the registry with rogue packages that include links to phishing campaigns in their README.md files, evocative of a  similar campaign  the software supply chain security firm exposed in December 2022. The fake modules masqueraded as cheats and free resources, with some packages named as "free-tiktok-followers," "free-xbox-codes," and "instagram-followers-free." The ultimate goal of the operation is to entice user

If you Google "third-party data breaches" you will find many recent reports of data breaches that were either caused by an attack at a third party or sensitive information stored at a third-party location was exposed. Third-party data breaches don't discriminate by industry because almost every company is operating with some sort of vendor relationship – whether it be a business partner, contractor or reseller, or the use of IT software or platform, or another service provider. Organizations are now sharing data with an average of 730 third-party vendors, according to a  report by Osano , and with the acceleration of digital transformation, that number will only grow. The Importance of Third-Party Risk Management With more organizations sharing data with more third-party vendors, it shouldn't be surprising that more than 50% of security incidents in the past two years have stemmed from a third-party with access privileges, according to a  CyberRisk Alliance report.

Hydrochasma: New Threat Actor Targets Shipping Companies and Medical Labs in Asia<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/hydrochasma-new-threat-actor-targets.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Shipping companies and medical laboratories in Asia have been the subject of a suspected espionage campaign carried out by a never-before-seen threat actor dubbed Hydrochasma . The activity, which has been ongoing since October 2022, "relies exclusively on publicly available and living-off-the-land tools," Symantec, by Broadcom Software,  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. There is no evidence available as yet to determine its origin or affiliation with known threat actors, but the cybersecurity company said the group may be having an interest in industry verticals that are involved in COVID-19-related treatments or vaccines. The standout aspects of the campaign is the absence of data exfiltration and custom malware, with the threat actor employing open source tools for intelligence gathering. By using already available tools, the goal, it appears, is to not only confuse attribution efforts, but also to make the attacks stealthier. The start of the infection

Threat Actors Adopt Havoc Framework for Post-Exploitation in Targeted Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/threat-actors-adopt-havoc-framework-for.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An open source command-and-control (C2) framework known as Havoc is being adopted by threat actors as an alternative to other well-known legitimate toolkits like  Cobalt Strike ,  Sliver , and  Brute Ratel . Cybersecurity firm Zscaler said it observed a new campaign in the beginning of January 2023 targeting an unnamed government organization that utilized  Havoc . "While C2 frameworks are prolific, the open-source Havoc framework is an advanced post-exploitation command-and-control framework capable of bypassing the most current and updated version of Windows 11 defender due to the implementation of advanced evasion techniques such as indirect syscalls and sleep obfuscation," researchers Niraj Shivtarkar and Niraj Shivtarkar  said . The attack sequence documented by Zscaler begins with a ZIP archive that embeds a decoy document and a screen-saver file that's designed to download and launch the Havoc Demon agent on the infected host.

Gcore Thwarts Massive 650 Gbps DDoS Attack on Free Plan Client<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/gcore-thwarts-massive-650-gbps-ddos.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
At the beginning of January, Gcore faced an incident involving several L3/L4 DDoS attacks with a peak volume of 650 Gbps. Attackers exploited over 2000 servers belonging to one of the top three cloud providers worldwide and targeted a client who was using a free CDN plan. However, due to Gcore's distribution of infrastructure and a large number of peering partners, the attacks were mitigated, and the client's web application remained available. Why was mitigating these attacks so significant? 1. These attacks were significant because they exceeded the average bandwidth of similar attacks by 60×.  The performed attacks relate to volume-based attacks targeted to saturate the attacked application's bandwidth in order to overflow it. Measuring total volume (bps)—rather than the number of requests—is the way these attacks are usually tabulated. The average bandwidth of this attack type is generally in the tens of Gbps (about 10 Gbps). Therefore, the specified attacks (at 650 Gbps) excee

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware on Tuesday released patches to address a critical security vulnerability affecting its Carbon Black App Control product. Tracked as  CVE-2023-20858 , the shortcoming carries a CVSS score of 9.1 out of a maximum of 10 and impacts App Control versions 8.7.x, 8.8.x, and 8.9.x. The virtualization services provider describes the issue as an injection vulnerability. Security researcher Jari Jääskelä has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug. "A malicious actor with privileged access to the App Control administration console may be able to use specially crafted input allowing access to the underlying server operating system," the company  said  in an advisory. VMware said there are no workarounds that resolve the flaw, necessitating that customers update to versions 8.7.8, 8.8.6, and 8.9.4 to mitigate potential risks. It's worth pointing out that Jääskelä was also credited with reporting two critical vulnerabilities in the same product ( CVE-2022-229

A sophisticated botnet known as MyloBot has compromised thousands of systems, with most of them located in India, the U.S., Indonesia, and Iran. That's according to new findings from BitSight, which  said  it's "currently seeing more than 50,000 unique infected systems every day," down from a high of 250,000 unique hosts in 2020. Furthermore, an analysis of MyloBot's infrastructure has found connections to a residential proxy service called BHProxies, indicating that the compromised machines are being used by the latter. MyloBot, which emerged on the threat landscape in 2017, was  first documented  by Deep Instinct in 2018, calling out its anti-analysis techniques and its ability to function as a downloader. "What makes Mylobot dangerous is its ability to download and execute any type of payload after it infects a host," Lumen's Black Lotus Labs  said  in November 2018.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the digital age evolves and continues to shape the business landscape, corporate networks have become increasingly complex and distributed. The amount of data a company collects to detect malicious behaviour constantly increases, making it challenging to detect deceptive and unknown attack patterns and the so-called "needle in the haystack". With a growing number of cybersecurity threats, such as data breaches, ransomware attacks, and malicious insiders, organizations are facing significant challenges in successfully monitoring and securing their networks. Furthermore, the talent shortage in the field of cybersecurity makes manual threat hunting and log correlation a cumbersome and difficult task. To address these challenges, organizations are turning to predictive analytics and Machine Learning (ML) driven network security solutions as essential tools for securing their networks against cyber threats and the unknown bad.

A new information stealer called  Stealc  that's being advertised on the dark web could emerge as a worthy competitor to other malware of its ilk. "The threat actor presents Stealc as a fully featured and ready-to-use stealer, whose development relied on  Vidar ,  Raccoon ,  Mars , and  RedLine  stealers," SEKOIA  said  in a Monday report. The French cybersecurity company said it  discovered   more than   40 Stealc samples  distributed in the wild and 35 active command-and-control (C2) servers, suggesting that the malware is already gaining traction among criminal groups. Stealc, first marketed by an actor named Plymouth on the XSS and BHF Russian-speaking underground forums on January 9, 2023, is written in C and comes with capabilities to steal data from web browsers, crypto wallets, email clients, and messaging apps. The malware-as-a-service (MaaS) also boasts of a "customizable" file grabber that allows its buyers to tailor the module to siphon files o

Popular cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase disclosed that it experienced a cybersecurity attack that targeted its employees. The company  said  its "cyber controls prevented the attacker from gaining direct system access and prevented any loss of funds or compromise of customer information." The incident, which took place on February 5, 2023, resulted in the exposure of a "limited amount of data" from its directory, including employee names, e-mail addresses, and some phone numbers. As part of the attack, several employees were targeted in an SMS phishing campaign urging them to sign in to their company accounts to read an important message. One employee is said to have fallen for the scam, who entered their username and password in a fake login page set up by the threat actors to harvest the credentials. "After 'logging in,' the employee is prompted to disregard the message and thanked for complying," the company said. "What hap

A spear-phishing campaign targeting Indian government entities aims to deploy an updated version of a backdoor called ReverseRAT . Cybersecurity firm ThreatMon  attributed  the activity to a threat actor tracked as  SideCopy . SideCopy is a threat group of Pakistani origin that shares overlaps with another actor called  Transparent Tribe . It is so named for mimicking the infection chains associated with  SideWinder  to deliver its own malware. The adversarial crew was first observed delivering ReverseRAT in 2021, when Lumen's Black Lotus Labs  detailed  a set of attacks targeting victims aligned with the government and power utility verticals in India and Afghanistan. Recent attack campaigns associated with SideCopy have primarily  set their sights  on a two-factor authentication solution known as Kavach (meaning "armor" in Hindi) that's used by Indian government officials.

Norwegian police agency Økokrim has announced the seizure of 60 million NOK (about $5.84 million) worth of cryptocurrency stolen by the Lazarus Group in March 2022 following the Axie Infinity Ronin Bridge hack. "This case shows that we also have a great capacity to follow the money on the blockchain, even if the criminals use advanced methods," the agency  said  in a statement. The development comes more than 10 months after the U.S. Treasury Department  implicated  the North Korea-backed hacking group for the theft of $620 million from the Ronin cross-chain bridge. Then in September 2022, the U.S. government  announced  the recovery of more than $30 million worth of cryptocurrency, representing 10% of the stolen funds. Økokrim said it worked with international law enforcement partners to follow and piece together the money trail, thereby making it more difficult for criminal actors to carry out money laundering activities.

Unknown malware presents a significant cybersecurity threat and can cause serious damage to organizations and individuals alike. When left undetected, malicious code can gain access to confidential information, corrupt data, and allow attackers to gain control of systems. Find out how to avoid these circumstances and detect unknown malicious behavior efficiently.  Challenges of new threats' detection While known malware families are more predictable and can be detected more easily, unknown threats can take on a variety of forms, causing a bunch of challenges for their detection: Malware developers use polymorphism, which enables them to modify the malicious code to generate unique variants of the same malware.  There is malware that is still not identified and doesn't have any rulesets for detection. Some threats can be Fully UnDetectable (FUD) for some time and challenge perimeter security.  The code is often encrypted, making it difficult to detect by signature-based

Russia's cyber attacks against Ukraine surged by 250% in 2022 when compared to two years ago, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Mandiant disclosed in a new joint report. The targeting, which  coincided  and has  since persisted  following the country's military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, focused heavily on the Ukrainian government and military entities, alongside critical infrastructure, utilities, public services, and media sectors. Mandiant  said  it observed, "more destructive cyber attacks in Ukraine during the first four months of 2022 than in the previous eight years with attacks peaking around the start of the invasion." As many as six unique wiper strains – including WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, Industroyer2, and SDelete – have been deployed against Ukrainian networks, suggesting a willingness on the part of Russian threat actors to forgo persistent access.

Cyber Espionage Group Earth Kitsune Deploys WhiskerSpy Backdoor in Latest Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/north-korean-cyber-espionage-group.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The cyber espionage threat actor tracked as  Earth Kitsune  has been observed deploying a new backdoor called WhiskerSpy as part of a social engineering campaign. Earth Kitsune, active since at least 2019, is  known  to primarily target individuals interested in North Korea with self-developed malware such as dneSpy and agfSpy. Previously documented intrusions have entailed the use of watering holes that leverage browser exploits in Google Chrome and Internet Explorer to activate the infection chain. The differentiating factor in the latest attacks is a shift to social engineering to trick users into visiting compromised websites related to North Korea, according to a new report from Trend Micro released last week. The cybersecurity company said the website of an unnamed pro-North Korean organization was hacked and modified to distribute the WhiskerSpy implant. The compromise was discovered at the end of last year. "When a targeted visitor tries to watch videos on the websit

Samsung Introduces New Feature to Protect Users from Zero-Click Malware Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/samsung-introduces-new-feature-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Samsung has announced a new feature called Message Guard that comes with safeguards to protect users from malware and spyware via what's referred to as zero-click attacks . The South Korean chaebol said the solution "preemptively" secures users' devices by "limiting exposure to invisible threats disguised as image attachments." The security feature, available on Samsung Messages and Google Messages, is currently limited to the Samsung Galaxy S23 series, with plans to expand it to other Galaxy smartphones and tablets later this year that are running on One UI 5.1 or higher. Zero-click attacks are highly-targeted and sophisticated attacks that exploit previously unknown flaws (i.e., zero-days) in software to trigger execution of malicious code without requiring any user interaction. Unlike traditional methods of remotely exploiting a device wherein threat actors rely on phishing tactics to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link or opening an rog

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Twitter has announced that it's limiting the use of SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) to its Blue subscribers. "While historically a popular form of 2FA, unfortunately we have seen phone-number based 2FA be used – and abused – by bad actors," the company  said . "We will no longer allow accounts to enroll in the text message/SMS method of 2FA unless they are Twitter Blue subscribers." Twitter users who have not subscribed to Blue that have enrolled for SMS-based 2FA have time till March 20, 2023, to switch to an alternative method such as an authenticator app or a hardware security key. After this cutoff date, non-Twitter Blue subscribers will have their option disabled. The alternative methods "require you to have physical possession of the authentication method and are a great way to ensure your account is secure," Twitter noted. Given that SMS has been the  least secure form of 2FA , the latest enforcement is likely to force people

GoDaddy Discloses Multi-Year Security Breach Causing Malware Installations and Source Code Theft<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/godaddy-discloses-multi-year-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Web hosting services provider GoDaddy on Friday disclosed a multi-year security breach that enabled unknown threat actors to install malware and siphon source code related to some of its services. The company attributed the campaign to a "sophisticated and organized group targeting hosting services." GoDaddy said in December 2022, it received an unspecified number of customer complaints about their websites getting sporadically redirected to malicious sites, which it later found was due to the unauthorized third party gaining access to servers hosted in its  cPanel environment . The threat actor "installed malware causing the intermittent redirection of customer websites," the company  said . The ultimate objective of the intrusions, GoDaddy said, is to "infect websites and servers with malware for phishing campaigns, malware distribution, and other malicious activities." In a related 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC

Experts Warn of RambleOn Android Malware Targeting South Korean Journalists<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/experts-warn-of-rambleon-android.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Suspected North Korean nation-state actors targeted a journalist in South Korea with a malware-laced Android app as part of a social engineering campaign. The findings come from South Korea-based non-profit Interlab, which coined the new malware  RambleOn . The malicious functionalities include the "ability to read and leak target's contact list, SMS, voice call content, location and others from the time of compromise on the target," Interlab threat researcher Ovi Liber  said  in a report published this week. The spyware camouflages as a secure chat app called  Fizzle  (ch.seme), but in reality, acts as a conduit to deliver a next-stage payload hosted on pCloud and Yandex. The chat app is said to have been sent as an Android Package (APK) file over WeChat to the targeted journalist on December 7, 2022, under the pretext of wanting to discuss a sensitive topic. The primary purpose of RambleOn is to function as a loader for another APK file ( com.data.WeCoin ) while

Entities in Armenia have come under a cyber attack using an updated version of a backdoor called  OxtaRAT  that allows remote access and desktop surveillance. "The tool capabilities include searching for and exfiltrating files from the infected machine, recording the video from the web camera and desktop, remotely controlling the compromised machine with TightVNC, installing a web shell, performing port scanning, and more," Check Point Research  said  in a report. The latest campaign is said to have commenced in November 2022 and marks the first time the threat actors behind the activity have expanded their focus beyond Azerbaijan. "The threat actors behind these attacks have been targeting human rights organizations, dissidents, and independent media in Azerbaijan for several years," the cybersecurity firm noted, calling the campaign Operation Silent Watch.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new variant of the notorious Mirai botnet has been found leveraging several security vulnerabilities to propagate itself to Linux and IoT devices. Observed during the second half of 2022, the new version has been dubbed  V3G4  by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, which identified three different campaigns likely conducted by the same threat actor. "Once the vulnerable devices are compromised, they will be fully controlled by attackers and become a part of the botnet," Unit 42 researchers  said . "The threat actor has the capability to utilize those devices to conduct further attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks." The attacks primarily single out exposed servers and networking devices running Linux, with the adversary weaponizing as many as 13 flaws that could lead to remote code execution (RCE). Some of the notable flaws relate to critical flaws in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center, DrayTek Vigor routers, Airspan AirSpot, and Geu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco has rolled out security updates to address a critical flaw reported in the ClamAV open source antivirus engine that could lead to remote code execution on susceptible devices. Tracked as  CVE-2023-20032  (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue relates to a case of remote code execution residing in the HFS+ file parser component. The flaw affects versions 1.0.0 and earlier, 0.105.1 and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier. Google security engineer Simon Scannell has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug. "This vulnerability is due to a missing buffer size check that may result in a heap buffer overflow write," Cisco Talos  said  in an advisory. "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HFS+ partition file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device." Successful exploitation of the weakness could enable an adversary to run arbitrary code with the same privileges as that of the ClamAV scanning process, or crash the process, resu

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A popular npm package with more than 3.5 million weekly downloads has been found vulnerable to an account takeover attack. "The package can be taken over by recovering an expired domain name for one of its maintainers and resetting the password," software supply chain security company Illustria  said  in a report. While npm's security protections limit users to have only one active email address per account, the Israeli firm said it was able to reset the GitHub password using the recovered domain. The attack, in a nutshell, grants a threat actor access to the package's associated GitHub account, effectively making it possible to publish trojanized versions to the npm registry that can be weaponized to conduct supply chain attacks at scale. This is achieved by taking advantage of a GitHub Action that's configured in the repository to automatically publish the packages when new code changes are pushed. "Even though the maintainer's npm user account i

The prolific  SideWinder  group has been attributed as the nation-state actor behind attempted attacks against 61 entities in Afghanistan, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka between June and November 2021. Targets included government, military, law enforcement, banks, and other organizations, according to an  exhaustive report  published by Group-IB, which also found links between the adversary and two other intrusion sets tracked as Baby Elephant and  DoNot Team . SideWinder  is also referred to as APT-C-17, Hardcore Nationalist (HN2), Rattlesnake, Razor Tiger, and T-APT4. It's suspected to be of Indian origin, although Kaspersky in 2022 noted that the attribution is no longer deterministic. The  group  has been linked to  no less than 1,000 attacks  against government organizations in the Asia-Pacific region since April 2020, according to a report from the Russian cybersecurity firm early last year. Of the 61 potential targets compiled by Group-IB, 29 of them are located

The ads have since been taken down. Some of the spoofed applications include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Telegram, WhatsApp, LINE, Signal, Skype, Electrum, Sogou Pinyin Method, Youdao, and WPS Office.

Researchers Warn of Critical Security Bugs in Schneider Electric Modicon PLCs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/researchers-warn-of-critical-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have disclosed two new vulnerabilities affecting Schneider Electric Modicon programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that could allow for authentication bypass and remote code execution. The flaws, tracked as  CVE-2022-45788  (CVSS score: 7.5) and  CVE-2022-45789  (CVSS score: 8.1), are part of a  broader collection  of  security defects  tracked by Forescout as OT:ICEFALL. Successful exploitation of the bugs could enable an adversary to execute unauthorized code, denial-of-service, or disclosure of sensitive information. The cybersecurity company said the shortcomings can be chained by a threat actor with known flaws from other vendors (e.g.,  CVE-2021-31886 ) to achieve deep lateral movement in operational technology (OT) networks. "Deep lateral movement lets attackers gain deep access to industrial control systems and cross often overlooked security perimeters, allowing them to perform highly granular and stealthy manipulations as well as override funct

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security teams typically have great visibility over most areas, for example, the corporate network, endpoints, servers, and cloud infrastructure. They use this visibility to enforce the necessary security and compliance requirements. However, this is not the case when it comes to sensitive data sitting in production or analytic databases, data warehouses or data lakes. Security teams have to rely on data teams to locate sensitive data and enforce access controls and security policies. This is a huge headache for both the security and data teams. It weakens the business's security and compliance putting it at risk of exposing sensitive data, large fines, reputational damages, and more. Also, in many cases, it slows down the business's ability to scale up data operations.  This article examines how Satori, a data security platform, gives control of the sensitive data in databases, data warehouses and data lakes to the security teams.

New Threat Actor WIP26 Targeting Telecom Service Providers in the Middle East<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/new-threat-actor-wip26-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Telecommunication service providers in the Middle East are being targeted by a previously undocumented threat actor as part of a suspected intelligence gathering mission. Cybersecurity firms SentinelOne and QGroup are tracking the activity cluster under the former's work-in-progress moniker  WIP26 . "WIP26 relies heavily on public cloud infrastructure in an attempt to evade detection by making malicious traffic look legitimate," researchers Aleksandar Milenkoski, Collin Farr, and Joey Chen  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. This includes the misuse of Microsoft 365 Mail, Azure, Google Firebase, and Dropbox for malware delivery, data exfiltration, and command-and-control (C2) purposes. The initial intrusion vector used in the attacks entails "precision targeting" of employees via WhatsApp messages that contain links to Dropbox links to supposedly benign archive files. The files, in reality, harbor a malware loader whose core feature is to depl

ESXiArgs Ransomware Hits Over 500 New Targets in European Countries<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/esxiargs-ransomware-hits-over-500-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More than 500 hosts have been newly compromised en masse by the ESXiArgs ransomware strain, most of which are located in France, Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K., and Ukraine. The  findings  come from attack surface management firm Censys, which  discovered  "two hosts with strikingly similar ransom notes dating back to mid-October 2022, just after ESXi versions 6.5 and 6.7 reached end of life." The first set of infections dates back to October 12, 2022, much earlier than when the campaign  began to gain traction  at the start of February 2023. Then on January 31, 2023, the ransom notes on the two hosts are said to have been updated with a revised version that matches the ones used in the current wave. Some of the crucial differences between the two ransom notes include the use of an onion URL instead of a Tox chat ID, a Proton Mail address at the bottom of the note, and a lower ransom demand (1.05 Bitcoin vs. 2.09 Bitcoin). "Each variant of the ransom notes from
