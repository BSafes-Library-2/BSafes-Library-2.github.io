The threat actor behind the Fodcha distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet has resurfaced with new capabilities, researchers reveal.  This includes changes to its communication protocol and the ability to extort cryptocurrency payments in exchange for stopping the DDoS attack against a target, Qihoo 360's Network Security Research Lab  said  in a report published last week.  Fodcha  first came to light  earlier this April, with the malware propagating through known vulnerabilities in Android and IoT devices as well as weak Telnet or SSH passwords.   The cybersecurity company said that Fodcha has evolved into a large-scale botnet with over 60,000 active nodes and 40 command-and-control (C2) domains that can "easily generate more than 1 Tbps traffic."  Peak activity is said to have occurred on October 11, 2022, when the malware targeted 1,396 devices in a single day.  The top countries singled out by the botnet since late June 2022 comprises China, the U.S., Singapore,

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In today's world of automated hacking systems, frequent data breaches and consumer protection regulations such as GDPR and PCI DSS, penetration testing is now an essential security requirement for organisations of all sizes. But what should you look for when choosing the right provider?  The sheer number of providers can be daunting, and finding one which can deliver a high-quality test at a reasonable price is not easy. How do you know if they're any good? What level of security expertise was included in the report? Is your application secure, or did the supplier simply not find the weaknesses?  There are no easy answers, but you can make it easier by asking the right questions up front. The most important considerations fall into three categories: certifications, experience, and price.  Certifications  Certifications are the best place to start, as they provide a quick shortcut for building trust. There's no shortage of professional certifications available, but one of t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unofficial patch has been made available for an actively exploited security flaw in Microsoft Windows that makes it possible for files signed with malformed signatures to sneak past Mark-of-the-Web ( MotW ) protections.  The fix,  released  by 0patch, arrives weeks after HP Wolf Security  disclosed  a Magniber ransomware campaign that targets users with fake security updates which employ a JavaScript file to proliferate the file-encrypting malware.   While files downloaded from the internet in Windows are tagged with a MotW flag to prevent unauthorized actions, it has since been found that corrupt Authenticode signatures can be used to allow the execution of arbitrary executables without any  SmartScreen warning .  Authenticode  is a Microsoft code-signing technology that authenticates the identity of the publisher of a particular piece of software and verifies whether the software was tampered with after it was signed and published.

Samsung Galaxy Store Bug Could've Let Hackers Secretly Install Apps on Targeted Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/samsung-galaxy-store-bug-couldve-let.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-patched security flaw has been disclosed in the Galaxy Store app for Samsung devices that could potentially trigger remote command execution on affected phones.  The vulnerability, which affects Galaxy Store version 4.5.32.4, relates to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug that occurs when handling certain  deep links . An independent security researcher has been credited with reporting the issue.  "Here, by not checking the deep link securely, when a user accesses a link from a website containing the deeplink, the attacker can execute JS code in the webview context of the Galaxy Store application," SSD Secure Disclosure  said  in an advisory posted last week.   XSS attacks  allow an adversary to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code when visiting a website from a browser or another application.   The issue identified in the Galaxy Store app has to do with how deep links are configured for Samsung's Marketing & Content Service ( MCS ), potentially leading to

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud-based repository hosting service GitHub has addressed a high-severity security flaw that could have been exploited to create malicious repositories and mount supply chain attacks.  The RepoJacking  technique,  disclosed  by Checkmarx, entails a bypass of a protection mechanism called  popular repository namespace retirement , which aims to prevent developers from pulling unsafe repositories with the same name.  The issue was addressed by the Microsoft-owned subsidiary on September 19, 2022 following responsible disclosure.   RepoJacking  occurs  when a creator of a repository opts to change the username, potentially enabling a threat actor to claim the old username and publish a rogue repository with the same name in an attempt to trick users into downloading them.   While Microsoft's countermeasure "retire[s] the namespace of any open source project that had more than 100 clones in the week leading up to the owner's account being renamed or deleted," Checkmarx

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Communication services provider Twilio this week disclosed that it experienced another "brief security incident" in June 2022 perpetrated by the same threat actor behind the  August hack  that resulted in unauthorized access of customer information.  The security event occurred on June 29, 2022, the company said in an updated advisory shared this week, as part of its probe into the digital break-in.  "In the June incident, a Twilio employee was socially engineered through voice phishing (or 'vishing') to provide their credentials, and the malicious actor was able to access customer contact information for a limited number of customers," Twilio  said .   It further said the access gained following the successful attack was identified and thwarted within 12 hours, and that it had alerted impacted customers on July 2, 2022.  The San Francisco-based firm did not reveal the exact number of customers impacted by the June incident, and why the disclosure was made

Multiple high-severity security flaws have been disclosed as affecting Juniper Networks devices, some of which could be exploited to achieve code execution.  Chief among them is a remote pre-authenticated PHP archive file deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2022-22241, CVSS score: 8.1) in the J-Web component of Junos OS, according to Octagon Networks researcher Paulos Yibelo.  "This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker to get remote phar files deserialized, leading to arbitrary file write, which leads to a remote code execution (RCE)," Yibelo  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.   Also identified are five other issues, which are listed as follow -   CVE-2022-22242  (CVSS score: 6.1) - A pre-authenticated reflected  XSS  on the error page ("error.php"), allowing a remote adversary to siphon Junos OS admin session and chained with other flaws that require authentication.

Five malicious dropper Android apps with over 130,000 cumulative installations have been discovered on the Google Play Store distributing banking trojans like  SharkBot  and  Vultur , which are capable of stealing financial data and performing on-device fraud.  "These droppers continue the unstopping evolution of malicious apps sneaking to the official store," Dutch mobile security firm ThreatFabric told The Hacker News in a statement.  "This evolution includes following newly introduced policies and masquerading as file managers and overcoming limitations by side-loading the malicious payload through the web browser."  Targets of these  droppers  include 231 banking and cryptocurrency wallet apps from financial institutions in Italy, the U.K., Germany, Spain, Poland, Austria, the U.S., Australia, France, and the Netherlands.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud computing was the lifeline that kept many companies running during the pandemic. But it was a classic case of medicine that comes with  serious  side effects.   Having anywhere, anytime access to data and apps gives companies tremendous flexibility in a fast-changing world, plus the means to scale and customize IT at will. The cloud is an asset or upgrade in almost every way.  With one glaring exception: cybersecurity.   The cloud promised to make companies more secure and security more straightforward. Yet over the same time period that the cloud took over computing, cyber attacks grew steadily worse while security teams felt increasingly overwhelmed.   Why?   We will explain shortly. For lean security teams, the more important question is how to make cloud security work, especially as the cloud footprint grows (a lot) faster than security resources. Will the cloud always cast a shadow on cybersecurity?  Not with the strategy outlined in a free ebook from Cynet called " Th

A recently discovered hacking group known for targeting employees dealing with corporate transactions has been linked to a new backdoor called Danfuan .  This hitherto undocumented malware is delivered via another dropper called Geppei, researchers from Symantec, by Broadcom Software,  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The dropper "is being used to install a new backdoor and other tools using the novel technique of reading commands from seemingly innocuous Internet Information Services ( IIS ) logs," the researchers said.   The toolset has been attributed by the cybersecurity company to a suspected espionage actor called UNC3524, aka Cranefly, which  first came to light  in May 2022 for its focus on bulk email collection from victims who deal with mergers and acquisitions and other financial transactions.  One of the group's key malware strains is QUIETEXIT, a backdoor deployed on network appliances that do not support antivirus or endpoint detection, such

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The increased use of information technology in our everyday life and business has led to cyber-attacks becoming more sophisticated and large-scale. For organizations to thrive in this era of technology, they must develop robust security strategies to detect and mitigate attacks. Defense in depth is a strategy in which companies use multiple layers of security measures to safeguard assets. A well-implemented defense in depth can help organizations prevent and mitigate ongoing attacks.   Defense in depth uses various cutting-edge security tools to safeguard a business's endpoints, data, applications, and networks. The objective is to prevent cyber threats, but a robust defense-in-depth approach also thwarts ongoing attacks and prevents further damage.  How organizations can implement defense in depth  The image above shows the various layers of security that organizations must implement. Below we describe ideas that companies should consider for each layer.  Governance and risk mana

The Raspberry Robin  worm is becoming an access-as-a-service malware for deploying other payloads, including  IcedID ,  Bumblebee ,  TrueBot  (aka Silence), and  Clop ransomware .  It is "part of a complex and interconnected malware ecosystem, with links to other malware families and alternate infection methods beyond its original USB drive spread," the Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)  said  in a detailed write-up.  Raspberry Robin , also called QNAP Worm owing to the use of compromised QNAP storage servers for command-and-control, is the name given to a malware by cybersecurity company Red Canary that spreads to Windows systems through infected USB drives.  MSTIC is keeping tabs on the activity group behind the USB-based Raspberry Robin infections as  DEV-0856 , adding it's aware of at least four confirmed entry points that all have the likely end goal of deploying ransomware.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A 34-year-old U.K. national has been arraigned in the U.S. for operating a dark web marketplace called  The Real Deal  that specialized in the sales of hacking tools and stolen login credentials.  Daniel Kaye , who went by a litany of pseudonyms Popopret, Bestbuy, UserL0ser, and Spdrman, has been charged with five counts of access device fraud and one count of money laundering conspiracy.  Kaye was indicted in April 2021, and subsequently consented to his extradition from Cyprus to the U.S. in September 2022.   "While living overseas, this defendant allegedly operated an illegal website that made hacking tools and login credentials available for purchase, including those for U.S. government agencies,"  said  U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan.  Court documents show that  The Real Deal , until its shutdown in 2016, functioned as a market for illicit items, including stolen account logins for U.S. government computers, bank accounts, and social media platforms such as Twitter and

As many as 85 command-and-control (C2) servers have been  discovered  supported by the ShadowPad malware since September 2021, with infrastructure detected as recently as October 16, 2022.  That's according to VMware's Threat Analysis Unit (TAU), which  studied  three ShadowPad variants using TCP, UDP, and HTTP(S) protocols for C2 communications.  ShadowPad , seen as a successor to  PlugX , is a modular malware platform privately shared among multiple Chinese state-sponsored actors since 2015.   Taiwanese cybersecurity firm TeamT5, earlier this May, disclosed details of another China-nexus modular implant named  Pangolin8RAT , which is believed to be the successor of the PlugX and ShadowPad malware families, linking it to a threat group dubbed Tianwu.   An analysis of the three ShadowPad artifacts, which have been previously put to use by  Winnti ,  Tonto Team , and an emerging threat cluster codenamed  Space Pirates , made it possible to discover the C2 servers by scanning th

Automobile, Energy, Media, Ransomware? When thinking about verticals, one may not instantly think of cyber-criminality. Yet, every move made by governments, clients, and private contractors screams toward normalizing those  menaces  as a new vertical.  Ransomware has every trait of the classical economical vertical. A thriving ecosystem of insurers, negotiators, software providers, and managed service experts.  This cybercrime branch looks at a loot stash that counts for trillions of dollars. The cybersecurity industry is too happy to provide services, software, and insurance to accommodate this new normal.   Intense insurer lobbying in France led the finance ministry to give a positive opinion about reimbursing ransoms, against the very advice of its government's cybersecurity branch. The market is so big and juicy that no one can get in the way of "the development of the cyber insurance market."  In the US, Colonial pipeline is seeking tax reductions from the loss incu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-patched security flaw in Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems could have potentially enabled apps with Bluetooth access to eavesdrop on conversations with Siri.  Apple said "an app may be able to record audio using a pair of connected AirPods," adding it addressed the Core Bluetooth issue in iOS 16.1 with improved entitlements.  Credited with discovering and reporting the bug in August 2022 is app developer Guilherme Rambo. The bug, dubbed  SiriSpy , has been assigned the identifier CVE-2022-32946.  "Any app with access to Bluetooth could record your conversations with Siri and audio from the iOS keyboard dictation feature when using AirPods or Beats headsets," Rambo  said  in a write-up.   "This would happen without the app requesting microphone access permission and without the app leaving any trace that it was listening to the microphone."  The vulnerability, according to Rambo, relates to a service called DoAP that's included in AirPo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new cryptojacking campaign has been uncovered targeting vulnerable Docker and Kubernetes infrastructures as part of opportunistic attacks designed to illicitly mine cryptocurrency.  Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike dubbed the activity  Kiss-a-dog , with its command-and-control infrastructure overlapping with those associated with other groups like  TeamTNT , which are known to  strike   misconfigured  Docker and Kubernetes instances.  The intrusions, spotted in September 2022, get their name from a domain named "kiss.a-dog[.]top" that's used to trigger a shell script payload on the compromised container using a Base64-encoded Python command.   "The URL used in the payload is obscured with backslashes to defeat automated decoding and regex matching to retrieve the malicious domain," CrowdStrike researcher Manoj Ahuje  said  in a technical analysis.  The attack chain subsequently attempts to escape the container and move laterally into the breached network, wh

A 26-year-old Ukrainian national has been charged in the U.S. for his alleged role in the  Raccoon Stealer  malware-as-a-service (MaaS) operation.  Mark Sokolovsky, who was arrested by Dutch law enforcement after leaving Ukraine on March 4, 2022, in what's said to be a Porsche Cayenne, is currently being held in the Netherlands and awaits extradition to the U.S.  "Individuals who deployed Raccoon Infostealer to steal data from victims leased access to the malware for approximately $200 per month, paid for by cryptocurrency," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)  said . "These individuals used various ruses, such as email phishing, to install the malware onto the computers of unsuspecting victims."   Sokolovsky is said to have gone by various online monikers like Photix, raccoonstealer, and black21jack77777 on online cybercrime forums to advertise the service for sale.

The threat actor behind a remote access trojan called RomCom RAT has been observed targeting Ukrainian military institutions as part of a new spear-phishing campaign that commenced on October 21, 2022.   The development marks a shift in the attacker's modus operandi, which has been previously attributed to spoofing legitimate apps like Advanced IP Scanner and pdfFiller to drop backdoors on compromised systems.  "The initial 'Advanced IP Scanner' campaign occurred on July 23, 2022," the BlackBerry research and intelligence team  said . "Once the victim installs a Trojanized bundle, it drops RomCom RAT to the system."   While previous iterations of the campaign involved the use of trojanized Advanced IP Scanner, the unidentified adversarial collective has since switched to pdfFiller as of October 20, indicating an active attempt on part of the adversary to refine tactics and thwart detection.  These lookalike websites host a rogue installer package that r

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A cybercrime group known as  Vice Society  has been linked to multiple ransomware strains in its malicious campaigns aimed at the education, government, and retail sectors.  The Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence team, which is tracking the threat cluster under the moniker DEV-0832, said the group avoids deploying ransomware in some cases and rather likely carries out extortion using exfiltrated stolen data.  "Shifting ransomware payloads over time from  BlackCat ,  Quantum Locker , and  Zeppelin , DEV-0832's latest payload is a Zeppelin variant that includes Vice Society-specific file extensions, such as .v-s0ciety, .v-society, and, most recently, .locked," the tech giant's cybersecurity division  said .   Vice Society, active since June 2021, has been steadily observed encrypting and exfiltrating victim data, and threatening companies with exposure of siphoned information to pressure them into paying a ransom.

Cisco has warned of active exploitation attempts targeting a pair of two-year-old security flaws in the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows.  Tracked as  CVE-2020-3153  (CVSS score: 6.5) and  CVE-2020-3433  (CVSS score: 7.8), the vulnerabilities could enable local authenticated attackers to perform DLL hijacking and copy arbitrary files to system directories with elevated privileges.   While CVE-2020-3153 was addressed by Cisco in February 2020, a fix for CVE-2020-3433 was shipped in August 2020.   "In October 2022, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team became aware of additional attempted exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild," the networking equipment maker said in an updated advisory.  "Cisco continues to strongly recommend that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this vulnerability."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware on Tuesday shipped security updates to address a critical security flaw in its VMware Cloud Foundation product.  Tracked as CVE-2021-39144, the issue has been rated 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system, and relates to a remote code execution vulnerability via XStream open source library.  "Due to an unauthenticated endpoint that leverages XStream for input serialization in VMware Cloud Foundation (NSX-V), a malicious actor can get remote code execution in the context of 'root' on the appliance," the company  said  in an advisory.   In light of the severity of the flaw and its relatively low bar for exploitation, the Palo Alto-based virtualization services provider has also made available a  patch  for end-of-life products.  Also addressed by VMware as part of the update is CVE-2022-31678 (CVSS score: 5.3), an XML External Entity ( XXE ) vulnerability that could be exploited to result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or unauthorized info

A high-severity vulnerability has been disclosed in the SQLite database library, which was introduced as part of a code change dating all the way back to October 2000 and could enable attackers to crash or control programs.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-35737  (CVSS score: 7.5), the 22-year-old issue affects SQLite versions  1.0.12  through 3.39.1, and has been addressed in  version 3.39.2  released on July 21, 2022.   "CVE-2022-35737 is  exploitable  on 64-bit systems, and exploitability depends on how the program is compiled," Trail of Bits researcher Andreas Kellas  said  in a technical write-up published today.  "Arbitrary code execution is confirmed when the library is compiled without stack canaries, but unconfirmed when stack canaries are present, and denial-of-service is confirmed in all cases."   Programmed in C, SQLite  is the most widely used  database engine , included by default in Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS, as well as popular web browsers such as Googl

The  Hive  ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group has claimed responsibility for a cyber attack against Tata Power that was disclosed by the company less than two weeks ago.  The incident is said to have occurred on October 3, 2022. The threat actor has also been observed leaking stolen data exfiltrated prior to encrypting the network as part of its double extortion scheme.

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details about a pair of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, one of which could be exploited to result in a denial-of-service (DoS).  The exploits, dubbed  LogCrusher  and  OverLog  by Varonis, take aim at the EventLog Remoting Protocol ( MS-EVEN ), which enables remote access to event logs.   While the former allows "any domain user to remotely crash the Event Log application of any Windows machine," OverLog causes a DoS by "filling the hard drive space of any Windows machine on the domain," Dolev Taler  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  OverLog has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-37981 (CVSS score: 4.3) and was addressed by Microsoft as part of its  October Patch Tuesday  updates. LogCrusher, however, remains unresolved.

How the Software Supply Chain Security is Threatened by Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/how-software-supply-chain-security-is.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Introduction  In many ways, the software supply chain is similar to that of manufactured goods, which we all know has been largely impacted by a global pandemic and shortages of raw materials.   However, in the IT world, it is not shortages or pandemics that have been the main obstacles to overcome in recent years, but rather attacks aimed at using them to harm hundreds or even thousands of victims simultaneously. If you've heard of a cyber attack between 2020 and today, it's likely that the software supply chain played a role.   When we talk about an attack on the software supply chain, we are actually referring to two successive attacks: one that targets a supplier, and one that targets one or more downstream users in the chain, using the first as a vehicle.  In this article, we will dive into the mechanisms and risks of the software supply chain by looking at a typical vulnerability of the modern development cycle: the presence of personal identifying information, or "

Cybercriminals Used Two PoS Malware to Steal Details of Over 167,000 Credit Cards<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/cybercriminals-used-two-pos-malware-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two point-of-sale (PoS) malware variants have been put to use by a threat actor to steal information related to more than 167,000 credit cards from payment terminals.  According to Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity company Group-IB, the stolen data dumps could net the operators as much as $3.34 million by selling them on underground forums.  While a significant proportion of attacks aimed at gathering payment data rely on  JavaScript sniffers  (aka web skimmers) stealthily inserted on e-commerce websites, PoS malware continues to be an ongoing, if less popular, threat.  Just last month, Kaspersky detailed new tactics adopted by a Brazilian threat actor known as  Prilex  to steal money by means of fraudulent transactions.   "Almost all PoS malware strains have a similar card dump extraction functionality, but different methods for maintaining persistence on infected devices, data exfiltration and processing," researchers Nikolay Shelekhov and Said Khamchiev  said .

Apple Releases Patch for New Actively Exploited iOS and iPadOS Zero-Day Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/apple-releases-patch-for-new-actively.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Tech giant Apple on Monday rolled out updates to remediate a zero-day flaw in iOS and iPadOS that it said has been actively exploited in the wild.  The weakness, given the identifier CVE-2022-42827 , has been described as an out-of-bounds write issue in the Kernel, which could be abused by a rogue application to execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges.  Successful exploitation of out-of-bounds write  flaws, which typically occur when a program attempts to write data to a memory location that's outside of the bounds of what it is allowed to access, can result in corruption of data, a crash, or execution of unauthorized code.  The iPhone maker said it addressed the bug with improved bounds checking, while crediting an anonymous researcher for reporting the vulnerability.  As is usually the case with actively exploited zero-day flaws, Apple refrained from sharing more specifics about the shortcoming other than acknowledging that it's "aware of a report that this i

The threat group, also called APT-C-17, Rattlesnake, and Razor Tiger, is  suspected  to be an Indian state-sponsored group, although a report from Kaspersky earlier this May acknowledged previous indicators that led to the attribution have since disappeared, making it challenging it to link the threat cluster to a specific nation.

The breach of LA Unified School District (LAUSD) highlights the prevalence of password vulnerabilities, as criminal hackers continue to use breached credentials in increasingly frequent ransomware attacks on education.

Researchers have disclosed details about a now-patched critical flaw in the Move virtual machine that powers the Aptos blockchain network.  The vulnerability "can cause Aptos nodes to crash and cause denial of service," Singapore-based Numen Cyber Labs  said  in a technical write-up published earlier this month.  Aptos is a  new entrant  to the blockchain space, which  launched  its  mainnet  on October 17, 2022. It has its roots in the Diem stablecoin payment system proposed by Meta (née Facebook), which also introduced a short-lived digital wallet called  Novi .   The network is built using a platform-agnostic programming language known as  Move , a Rust-based system that's  designed  to implement and execute  smart contracts  in a secure  runtime environment , also known as the Move Virtual Machine (aka  MoveVM ).   The  vulnerability  identified by Numen Cyber Labs is rooted in the Move language's verification module (" stack_usage_verifier.rs "), a com

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious  Emotet botnet  has been linked to a new wave of malspam campaigns that take advantage of password-protected archive files to drop CoinMiner and Quasar RAT on compromised systems.  In an  attack chain  detected by Trustwave SpiderLabs researchers, an invoice-themed ZIP file lure was found to contain a nested self-extracting (SFX) archive, the first archive acting as a conduit to launch the second.  While phishing attacks like these traditionally require persuading the target into opening the attachment, the cybersecurity company said the campaign sidesteps this hurdle by making use of a batch file to automatically supply the password to unlock the payload.   The first SFX archive file further makes use of either a PDF or Excel icon to make it appear legitimate, when, in reality, it contains three components: the password-protected second SFX RAR file, the aforementioned batch script which launches the archive, and a decoy PDF or image.  "The execution of the batch f

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-patched vulnerability in VMware Workspace ONE Access has been observed being exploited to deliver both cryptocurrency miners and ransomware on affected machines.  "The attacker intends to utilize a victim's resources as much as possible, not only to install RAR1Ransom for extortion, but also to spread GuardMiner to collect cryptocurrency," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin  said  in a Thursday report.   The issue, tracked as CVE-2022-22954  (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a remote code execution vulnerability that stems from a case of server-side template injection. Although the shortcoming was addressed by the virtualization services provider in April 2022, it has since come under  active  exploitation  in the wild.   Fortinet said it observed in August 2022 attacks that sought to weaponize the flaw to deploy the  Mirai botnet  on Linux devices as well as the RAR1Ransom and  GuardMiner , a variant of the XMRig Monero miner.  The Mirai sample is retrieved fr

WordPress security company Wordfence on Thursday said it started detecting exploitation attempts targeting the newly disclosed flaw in Apache Commons Text  on October 18, 2022.  The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2022-42889  aka  Text4Shell , has been assigned a severity ranking of 9.8 out of a possible 10.0 on the CVSS scale and affects versions 1.5 through 1.9 of the library.  It's also similar to the now infamous  Log4Shell  vulnerability in that the  issue  is rooted in the manner  string substitutions  carried out during  DNS, script, and URL lookups  could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on susceptible systems when passing untrusted input.   "The attacker can send a crafted payload remotely using 'script,' 'dns,' and 'url' lookups to achieve arbitrary remote code execution," Zscaler ThreatLabZ team explained .

The text of the announcement contains several statements that anyone who's ever read about cybersecurity will have heard many times over: increasing resilience, greater awareness, countering ransomware attacks – the list goes on.   There are some novel aspects to the text as well, including a realization that cybersecurity is not, has never been, and will never be something that can be solved at the nation-state level.   The White House also pointed to IoT warning labels as a solution – and reminded us all (and we do need reminding) about the importance of cybersecurity education. Let's take a look.  International cooperation is critical  A key point that the White House statement makes very clear is that cyberattacks are asymmetric in the

Microsoft also emphasized that the B2B leak was "caused by an unintentional misconfiguration on an endpoint that is not in use across the Microsoft ecosystem and was not the result of a security vulnerability."  The misconfiguration of the Azure Blob Storage was spotted on September 24, 2022, by cybersecurity company SOCRadar, which termed the leak  BlueBleed .

A Russian-speaking ransomware group dubbed OldGremlin has been attributed to 16 malicious campaigns aimed at entities operating in the transcontinental Eurasian nation over the course of two and a half years.  "The group's victims include companies in sectors such as logistics, industry, insurance, retail, real estate, software development, and banking," Group-IB  said  in an exhaustive report shared with The Hacker News. "In 2020, the group even targeted an arms manufacturer."  In what's a rarity in the ransomware landscape, OldGremlin (aka TinyScouts) is one of the very few financially motivated cybercrime gangs that primarily focuses on Russian companies.  Other notable groups consist of Dharma, Crylock, and Thanos, contributing to an uptick in ransomware attacks targeting businesses in the country by over 200% in 2021.

Hackers Using New Version of FurBall Android Malware to Spy on Iranian Citizens<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/hackers-using-new-version-of-furball.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian threat actor known as Domestic Kitten  has been attributed to a new mobile campaign that masquerades as a translation app to distribute an updated variant of an Android malware known as FurBall.  "Since June 2021, it has been distributed as a translation app via a copycat of an Iranian website that provides translated articles, journals, and books," ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The updates, while retaining the same surveillance functionality as earlier versions, are designed to evade detection by security solutions, the Slovak cybersecurity firm added.  Domestic Kitten, also called APT-C-50, is an Iranian threat activity cluster that has been previously identified as targeting individuals of interest with the goal of harvesting sensitive information from compromised mobile devices. It's been known to be active since at least 2016.   A tactical analysis conducted by Trend Micro in 2019 revealed Domestic Kitten

Not All Sandboxes Are for Children: How to Secure Your SaaS Sandbox<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/not-all-sandboxes-are-for-children-how.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
When creating a Sandbox, the mindset tends to be that the Sandbox is considered a place to play around, test things, and there will be no effect on the production or operational system. Therefore, people don't actively think they need to worry about its security. This mindset is not only wrong, but extremely dangerous.   When it comes to software developers, their version of sandbox is similar to a child's playground — a place to build and test without breaking any flows in production. Meanwhile, in the world of cybersecurity, the term 'sandbox' is used to describe a virtual environment or machine used to run suspicious code and other elements.   Many organizations use a Sandbox for their SaaS apps — to test changes without disrupting the production SaaS app or even to connect new apps (much like a software developer's Sandbox). This common practice often leads to a false sense of security and in turn a lack of thought for its security implications. This article wi

New Ursnif Variant Likely Shifting Focus to Ransomware and Data Theft<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/latest-ursnif-variant-shifts-focus-from.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Ursnif malware has become the latest malware to shed its roots as a banking trojan to revamp itself into a generic backdoor capable of delivering next-stage payloads, joining the likes of Emotet, Qakbot, and TrickBot.  "This is a significant shift from the malware's original purpose to enable banking fraud, but is consistent with the broader threat landscape," Mandiant researchers Sandor Nemes, Sulian Lebegue, and Jessa Valdez  disclosed  in a Wednesday analysis.   The refreshed and refactored variant, first spotted by the Google-owned threat intelligence firm in the wild on June 23, 2022, has been codenamed LDR4, in what's being seen as an attempt to lay the groundwork for potential ransomware and data theft extortion operations.  Ursnif, also called Gozi or ISFB, is one of the oldest banker malware families, with  the earliest documented attacks  going as far back as 2007.

The Federal Police of Brazil on Wednesday announced it had arrested an individual for purported links to the notorious LAPSUS$ extortionist gang.  The arrest was made as part of a new law enforcement effort, dubbed Operation Dark Cloud, that was launched in August 2022, the agency noted. Not much is known about the suspect other than the fact that the person could be a teenager.  The Polícia Federal said it commenced its investigation in December 2021 following an attack on websites under Brazil's  Ministry of Health , resulting in the alleged exfiltration of 50TB of data and  temporary unavailability  of COVID-19 vaccination data of millions of citizens.  Other federal government portals targeted by the LAPSUS$ group in Brazil include the Ministry of Economy, Comptroller General of the Union, and the Federal Highway Police.

Cybersecurity researchers have shared more details about a now-patched security flaw in Azure Service Fabric Explorer (SFX) that could potentially enable an attacker to gain administrator privileges on the cluster.  The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2022-35829 , carries a CVSS severity rating of 6.2 and was addressed by Microsoft as part of its  Patch Tuesday updates  last week.   Orca Security, which  discovered and reported  the flaw to the tech giant on August 11, 2022, dubbed the vulnerability  FabriXss  (pronounced "fabrics"). It impacts Azure Fabric Explorer version 8.1.316 and prior.  SFX is described by Microsoft as an  open-source tool  for inspecting and managing  Azure Service Fabric  clusters, a distributed systems platform that's used to build and deploy microservices-based cloud applications.   The vulnerability is rooted in the fact that a user with  permissions  to "Create Compose Application" through the SFX client can leverage the privileges

An advanced persistent threat (APT) group of Chinese origin codenamed  DiceyF  has been linked to a string of attacks aimed at online casinos in Southeast Asia for years.  Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky said the activity aligns with another set of intrusions attributed to  Earth Berberoka  (aka  GamblingPuppet ) and  DRBControl , citing tactical and targeting similarities as well as the abuse of secure messaging clients.   "Possibly we have a mix of espionage and [intellectual property] theft, but the true motivations remain a mystery," researchers Kurt Baumgartner and Georgy Kucherin  said  in a technical write-up published this week.  The starting point of the investigation was in November 2021 when Kaspersky said it detected multiple  PlugX loaders  and other payloads that were deployed via an employee monitoring service and a security package deployment service.   The initial infection method – the distribution of the framework through security solution packages

In the world of insurance providers and policies, cyber insurance is a fairly new field. And many security teams are trying to wrap their heads around it.   What is it and do they need it? And with what time will they spend researching how to integrate cyber insurance into their strategy?   For small security teams, this is particularly challenging as they contend with limited resources.  Luckily, there's a  new eBook  dedicated to helping small security teams better understand cyber insurance policies and how they may impact an organization's cybersecurity measures.  Background  In 1997, the "Internet Security Liability" (ISL) insurance policy was launched at the International Risk Insurance Management Society's convention in Honolulu. Underwritten by AIG, ISL insurance was designed to protect ecommerce retailers like Amazon that were collecting sensitive customer data and storing it on internal networks. It is credited as one of the very first cyber insurance policies to be made ava

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a previously undocumented and fully undetectable (FUD) PowerShell backdoor that gains its stealth by disguising itself as part of a Windows update process.  "The covert self-developed tool and the associated C2 commands seem to be the work of a sophisticated, unknown threat actor who has targeted approximately 100 victims," Tomer Bar, director of security research at SafeBreach,  said  in a new report.  Attributed to an  unnamed threat actor , attack chains involving the malware commence with a weaponized  Microsoft Word document  that, per the company, was uploaded from Jordan on August 25, 2022.   Metadata associated with the lure document indicates that the initial intrusion vector is a LinkedIn-based spear-phishing attack, which ultimately leads to the execution of a PowerShell script via a piece of embedded macro code.   The PowerShell script ( Script1.ps1 ) is designed to connect to a remote command-and-control (C2) server and retrieve a comm

Both cryptocurrency and ransomware are nothing new in the digital world; both have been there for a very long time, which was enough for them to find common pieces for starting their relationship.  Ransomware can be like a virtual car that works on all types of fuels, and crypto is the one that is currently most recommended. No one can argue that 2020 was the year of ransomware in the cyber world, but it wasn't due to the fact that cybercriminals chose ransomware just because they knew how to attack properly. It's because of the fact that crypto rose mostly this year, along with the new normal of the digital world. It gave them a new cause to stick to ransomware, thanks to the anonymous payments that can be made using a cryptocurrency.   How does ransomware work?   Ransomware is a malware type that encrypts the victim's files, whether it's a random user or an organization, leading to denying them access to those files on their personal devices.

The China-aligned espionage-focused actor dubbed Winnti has set its sights on government organizations in Hong Kong as part of an ongoing campaign dubbed  Operation CuckooBees .  Active since at least 2007,  Winnti  (aka APT41, Barium, Bronze Atlas, and Wicked Panda) is the name designated to a prolific cyber threat group that carries out Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity, predominantly aimed at stealing intellectual property from organizations in developed economies.  The threat actor's campaigns have targeted healthcare, telecoms, high-tech, media, agriculture, and education sectors, with infection chains primarily relying on spear-phishing emails with attachments to initially break into the victims' networks.  Earlier this May, Cybereason  disclosed  long-running attacks orchestrated by the group since 2019 to siphon technology secrets from technology and manufacturing companies mainly located in East Asia, Western Europe, and North America.

Law enforcement authorities in France, in collaboration with Spain and Latvia, have disrupted a cybercrime ring that leveraged a hacking tool to steal cars without having to use a physical key fob.  "The criminals targeted vehicles with keyless entry and start systems, exploiting the technology to get into the car and drive away," Europol  said  in a press statement.   The coordinated operation, which took place on October 10, 2022, resulted in the arrest of 31 suspects from across 22 locations in the three nations, including software developers, its resellers, and the car thieves who used the tool to break into vehicles.  Also confiscated by the officials as part of the arrests were criminal assets worth €1,098,500, not to mention an internet domain that allegedly advertised the service online.  Per Europol, the criminals are said to have singled out keyless vehicles from two unnamed French car manufacturers. The perpetrators then used the fraudulent package to replace the

HelpSystems, the company behind the Cobalt Strike software platform, has released an out-of-band security update to address a remote code execution vulnerability that could allow an attacker to take control of targeted systems.  Cobalt Strike is a commercial red-team framework that's mainly used for adversary simulation, but cracked versions of the software have been  actively   abused  by ransomware operators and espionage-focused advanced persistent threat (APT) groups alike.  The  post-exploitation tool  consists of a team server, which functions as a command-and-control (C2) component, and a beacon, the default malware used to create a connection to the team server and drop next-stage payloads.   The issue, tracked as  CVE-2022-42948 , affects Cobalt Strike version 4.7.1, and stems from an incomplete patch released on September 20, 2022, to rectify a cross-site scripting ( XSS ) vulnerability ( CVE-2022-39197 ) that could lead to remote code execution.

The development marks the first time the  nascent adversary simulation software  is being delivered via a Qakbot infection, cybersecurity firm Trend Micro  said  in a technical analysis released last week.  The intrusion, achieved using a phishing email containing a weaponized link pointing to a ZIP archive, further entailed the use of Cobalt Strike for lateral movement.  While these legitimate utilities are designed for conducting penetration testing activities, their ability to offer remote access has made them a lucrative tool in the hands of attackers looking to stealthily probe the compromised environment without attracting attention for extended periods of time.  This has been compounded by the fact that a  cracked version  of Brute Ratel C4 began circulating last month across the cybercrimi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has disclosed what's being called a security vulnerability in Microsoft 365 that could be exploited to infer message contents due to the use of a broken cryptographic algorithm.  "The [Office 365 Message Encryption] messages are encrypted in insecure Electronic Codebook ( ECB ) mode of operation," Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure  said  in a report published last week.  Office 365 Message Encryption (OME) is a security mechanism used to send and receive encrypted email messages between users inside and outside an organization without revealing anything about the communications themselves.   A consequence of the newly disclosed issue is that rogue third-parties gaining access to the encrypted email messages may be able to decipher the messages, effectively breaking confidentiality protections.  Electronic Codebook is one of the simplest modes of encryption wherein each message block is encoded separately by a key, meaning identical plaintext blocks wi

Don't let the ongoing " crypto winter " lull you into a false sense of cybersecurity. Even as  cryptocurrencies lose value  — and some crypto companies  file for bankruptcy  —  cryptojacking  still poses an urgent threat to enterprises across industries, from financial services to healthcare to industry 4.0 and beyond.   Broadly speaking, cryptojacking is defined as the unauthorized and illegitimate use of an unwitting party's compute and/or server power by a malicious actor to mine cryptocurrencies. While everyone with an internet connection is technically vulnerable to cryptojacking, most attacks target enterprises with significant compute resources, especially those with an outsized number of third-party relationships. (More on that last part in a bit.) And if a malicious actor can breach your cybersecurity defenses for cryptojacking purposes, they can breach them for any number of nefarious reasons.   Under normal conditions, mining for cryptocurrency is hugely expensive because d

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new ransomware campaign targeted the transportation and logistics sectors in Ukraine and Poland on October 11 with a previously unknown payload dubbed  Prestige .  "The activity shares victimology with recent Russian state-aligned activity, specifically on affected geographies and countries, and overlaps with previous victims of the  FoxBlade  malware (also known as HermeticWiper)," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)  said .  The tech giant remarked the intrusions occurred within an hour of each other across all victims, attributing the infections to an unnamed cluster called DEV-0960. It did not disclose the scale of the attacks, but stated it's notifying all affected customers.  The campaign is also believed to be distinct from other recent destructive attacks that have involved the use of  HermeticWiper  and  CaddyWiper , the latter of which is launched by a malware loader called  ArguePatch  (aka AprilAxe).   The method of initial access remains unkno

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Zimbra has  released patches  to contain an actively exploited security flaw in its enterprise collaboration suite that could be leveraged to upload arbitrary files to vulnerable instances.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-41352  (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue affects a component of the Zimbra suite called  Amavis , an open source content filter, and more specifically, the cpio utility it uses to scan and extract archives.   The flaw, in turn, is said to be rooted in another underlying vulnerability ( CVE-2015-1197 ) that was first disclosed in early 2015, which  according to Flashpoint  was rectified, only to be subsequently reverted in later Linux distributions.  "An attacker can use cpio package to gain incorrect access to any other user accounts," Zimbra said in an advisory published last week, adding it "recommends pax over cpio."  Fixes are available in the following versions -   Zimbra 9.0.0 Patch 27  Zimbra 8.8.15 Patch 34   All an adversary seeking needs to do to weapo

Tata Power Company Limited, India's largest integrated power company, on Friday confirmed it was targeted by a cyberattack.

It further said it has taken steps to retrieve and restore the affected machines, adding it put in place security guardrails for customer-facing portals to prevent unauthorized access.  The Mumbai-based electric utility company, part of the Tata Group conglomerate, did not disclose any further details about the nature of the attack, or when it took place.  That said, cybersecurity firm Recorded Future in April  disclosed  attacks mounted by China-linked adversaries targeting Indian power grid organizations.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a now-patched security flaw in Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) that could be exploited by an attacker to gain elevated permissions on compromised machines.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-37969  (CVSS score: 7.8), the issue was addressed by Microsoft as part of its Patch Tuesday updates for September 2022, while also noting that it was being actively exploited in the wild.  "An attacker must already have access and the ability to run code on the target system," the company  noted  in its advisory. "This technique does not allow for remote code execution in cases where the attacker does not already have that ability on the target system."  It also credited researchers from CrowdStrike, DBAPPSecurity, Mandiant, and Zscaler for reporting the vulnerability without delving into additional specifics surrounding the nature of the attacks.   Now, the Zscaler ThreatLabz researcher team has disclosed  that it captured an in-the-wild exploit for the the

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Telecommunications and IT service providers in the Middle East and Asia are being targeted by a previously undocumented Chinese-speaking threat group dubbed WIP19 .  The espionage-related attacks are characterized by the use of a stolen digital certificate issued by a Korean company called DEEPSoft  to sign malicious artifacts deployed during the infection chain to evade detection.  "Almost all operations performed by the threat actor were completed in a 'hands-on keyboard' fashion, during an interactive session with compromised machines," SentinelOne researchers Joey Chen and Amitai Ben Shushan Ehrlich  said  in a report this week.   "This meant the attacker gave up on a stable [command-and-control] channel in exchange for stealth."  WIP, short for work-in-progress, is the moniker assigned by SentinelOne to emerging or hitherto unattributed activity clusters,  similar  to the UNC####, DEV-####, and TAG-## designations given by Mandiant, Microsoft, and Reco

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A PHP version of an information-stealing malware called  Ducktail  has been discovered in the wild being distributed in the form of cracked installers for legitimate apps and games, according to the latest findings from Zscaler.  "Like older versions (.NetCore), the latest version (PHP) also aims to exfiltrate sensitive information related to saved browser credentials, Facebook account information, etc.," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Tarun Dewan and Stuti Chaturvedi  said .   Ducktail, which emerged on the threat landscape in late 2021, is attributed to an unnamed Vietnamese threat actor, with the malware primarily designed to hijack Facebook business and advertising accounts.  The financially motivated cybercriminal operation was  first documented  by Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure (formerly F-Secure) in late July 2022.   While previous versions of the malware were found to use Telegram as a command-and-control (C2) channel to exfiltrate information, the PHP var

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Web infrastructure and security company Cloudflare disclosed this week that it halted a 2.5 Tbps distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack launched by a Mirai botnet.  Characterizing it as a "multi-vector attack consisting of UDP and TCP floods," researcher Omer Yoachimik said the DDoS attack targeted the Minecraft server Wynncraft in Q3 2022.  "The entire 2.5 Tbps attack lasted about 2 minutes, and the peak of the 26 million rps attack [was] only 15 seconds," Yoachimik  noted . "This is the largest attack we've ever seen from the bitrate perspective."  Cloudflare also pointed to a surge in multi-terabit DDoS attacks as well as longer-lasting volumetric attacks during the time period, not to mention an uptick in attacks targeting Taiwan and Japan.   The disclosure comes almost 10 months after Microsoft said it thwarted a  record-breaking 3.47 Tbps DDoS attack  in November 2021 directed against an unnamed Azure customer in Asia.

A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code has been made available for the recently disclosed critical security flaw affecting Fortinet FortiOS, FortiProxy, and FortiSwitchManager, making it imperative that users move quickly to apply the patches.  "FortiOS exposes a management web portal that allows a user to configure the system," Horizon3.ai researcher James Horseman  said . "Additionally, a user can SSH into the system which exposes a locked down CLI interface."   The issue, tracked as  CVE-2022-40684  (CVSS score: 9.6), concerns an  authentication bypass  vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to perform malicious operations on the administrative interface via specially crafted HTTP(S) requests.  A successful exploitation of the shortcoming is tantamount to granting complete access "to do just about anything" on the affected system, including altering network configurations, adding malicious users, and intercepting network traffic.   That said,

A previously undocumented command-and-control (C2) framework dubbed Alchimist is likely being used in the wild to target Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.  "Alchimist C2 has a web interface written in Simplified Chinese and can generate a configured payload, establish remote sessions, deploy payload to the remote machines, capture screenshots, perform remote shellcode execution, and run arbitrary commands," Cisco Talos  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Written in GoLang, Alchimist is complemented by a beacon implant called Insekt, which comes with remote access features that can be instrumented by the C2 server.   The discovery of Alchimist and its assorted family of malware implants comes three months after Talos also detailed another self-contained framework known as  Manjusaka , which has been  touted  as the "Chinese sibling of Sliver and Cobalt Strike."  Even more interestingly, both Manjusaka and Alchimist pack in similar functionalities, desp

New Timing Attack Against NPM Registry API Could Expose Private Packages<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/new-timing-attack-against-npm-registry.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A novel timing attack discovered against the npm's registry API can be exploited to potentially disclose private packages used by organizations, putting developers at risk of supply chain threats.  "By creating a list of possible package names, threat actors can detect organizations'  scoped private packages  and then masquerade public packages, tricking employees and users into downloading them," Aqua Security researcher Yakir Kadkoda  said .   The Scoped Confusion attack banks on analyzing the time it takes for the  npm API  (registry.npmjs[.]org) to return an HTTP 404 error message when querying for a private package, and measuring it against the response time for a non-existing module.   "It takes on average less time to get a reply for a private package that does not exist compared to a private package that does," Kadkoda explained.  The idea, ultimately, is to identify packages internally used by companies, which could then be used by threat actors to

An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor known as  Budworm  targeted a U.S.-based entity for the first time in more than six years, according to latest research.  The attack was aimed at an unnamed U.S. state legislature, the Symantec Threat Hunter team, part of Broadcom Software,  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Other "strategically significant" intrusions mounted over the past six months were directed against a government of a Middle Eastern country, a multinational electronics manufacturer, and a hospital in South East Asia.  Budworm , also called APT27, Bronze Union, Emissary Panda, Lucky Mouse, and Red Phoenix, is a threat actor that's believed to operate on behalf of China through attacks that leverage a mix of custom and openly available tools to exfiltrate information of interest.

An unofficial version of the popular WhatsApp messaging app called YoWhatsApp has been observed deploying an Android trojan known as Triada.  The goal of the malware is to steal the keys that "allow the use of a WhatsApp account  without the app ," Kaspersky  said  in a new report. "If the keys are stolen, a user of a malicious WhatsApp mod can lose control over their account."   YoWhatsApp offers the ability for users to lock chats, send messages to unsaved numbers, and customize the app with a variety of theming options. It's also said to share overlaps with other modded WhatsApp clients such as FMWhatsApp and HeyMods.  The Russian cybersecurity company said it found the malicious functionality in YoWhatsApp version 2.22.11.75.   Typically spread through fraudulent ads on Snaptube and Vidmate, the app, upon installation, requests the victims to grant it permissions to access SMS messages, enabling the malware to enroll them to paid subscriptions without their

Hackers Using Vishing to Trick Victims into Installing Android Banking Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/hackers-using-vishing-tactics-to-trick.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors are resorting to voice phishing (vishing) tactics to dupe victims into installing Android malware on their devices, new research  from ThreatFabric reveals.  The Dutch mobile security company said it identified a network of phishing websites targeting Italian online-banking users that are designed to get hold of their contact details.  Telephone-oriented attack delivery (TOAD), as the social engineering technique is called, involves calling the victims using previously collected information from fraudulent websites.  The caller, who purports to be a support agent for the bank, instructs the individual, on the other hand, to install a security app and grant it extensive permissions, when, in reality, it's malicious software intended to gain remote access or conduct financial fraud.   In this case, it leads to the deployment of an Android malware dubbed  Copybara , a mobile trojan first detected in November 2021 and is primarily used to perform on-device fraud via o

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As software supply chain security becomes more and more crucial, security, DevSecOps, and DevOps teams are more challenged than ever to build transparent trust in the software they deliver or use. In fact, in Gartner recently published their 2022 cybersecurity predictions - not only do they anticipate the continued expansion of attack surfaces in the near future, they also list digital supply chain as a major rising attack surface and one of the top trends to follow in 2022.  After all, any software is only as secure as the weakest link in its supply chain. One bad component, any malicious access to your development environment—or any vulnerability in your software's delivery life cycle—and you risk your code's integrity, your customers, and your reputation.   Scribe Security  recently launched a new platform that claims to address these urgent needs by enabling its users to build trust in their software across teams and organizations.

Google Rolling Out Passkey Passwordless Login Support to Android and Chrome<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/google-rolling-out-passkey-passwordless.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Wednesday officially rolled out support for passkeys, the next-generation authentication standard, to both Android and Chrome.  "Passkeys are a significantly safer replacement for passwords and other phishable authentication factors," the tech giant  said . "They cannot be reused, don't leak in server breaches, and protect users from phishing attacks."   The feature was  first announced  in May 2022 as part of a broader push to support a common passwordless sign-in standard.  Passkeys, established by the FIDO Alliance and also backed by  Apple and Microsoft , aim to replace standard passwords with unique digital keys that are stored locally on the device.   To that end, creating a passkey requires confirmation from the end-user about the account that will be used to log in to the online service, followed by using their biometric information or the  device   passcode .  Signing in to a website on a mobile device is also a simple two-step process that e

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind the BazaCall call back phishing method have continued to evolve with updated social engineering tactics to deploy malware on targeted networks.  The scheme eventually acts as an entry point to conduct financial fraud or the delivery of next-stage payloads such as ransomware, cybersecurity company Trellix  said  in a report published last week.  Primary targets of the latest attack waves include the U.S., Canada, China, India, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and the U.K.   BazaCall , also called BazarCall, first gained popularity in 2020 for its novel approach of distributing the BazarBackdoor (aka BazarLoader) malware by manipulating potential victims into calling a phone number specified in decoy email messages.  These email baits aim to create a false sense of urgency, informing the recipients about renewal of a trial subscription for, say, an antivirus service. The messages also urge them to contact their support desk to cancel the plan, or risk getting automat

Researchers Detail Critical RCE Flaw Reported in Popular vm2 JavaScript Sandbox<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/researchers-detail-critical-rce-flaw.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-patched security flaw in the vm2 JavaScript sandbox module could be abused by a remote adversary to break out of security barriers and perform arbitrary operations on the underlying machine.  "A threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox," GitHub  said  in an advisory published on September 28, 2022.   The issue, tracked as CVE-2022-36067 and codenamed Sandbreak, carries a maximum severity rating of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system. It has been addressed in  version 3.9.11  released on August 28, 2022.  vm2 is a  popular Node library  that's used to run untrusted code with allowlisted built-in modules. It's also one of the most widely downloaded software, accounting for nearly 3.5 million downloads per week.   The  shortcoming  is rooted in the error mechanism in Node.js to escape the sandbox, according to application security firm Oxeye, which  discovered the flaw .  This mean

The White House has recently announced a $1 billion cyber security grant program that is designed to help state and local governments improve their cyber defenses, especially about protecting critical infrastructure. The  recent executive order  stems from the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that was signed almost a year ago. That bill allocated $1 billion for  protecting critical infrastructure against cyber-attack  in the wake of a series of high-profile ransomware attacks such as the one that brought down the Colonial Pipeline.   Those government agencies who wish to take advantage of these funding opportunities must submit a grant proposal by mid-November. Proposals are only being accepted for the sixty days following the program's announcement.  Grant recipients can use the funding to invest in new cybersecurity initiatives or to make improvements to existing defenses. Awardees are guaranteed to receive a minimum of $2 million. However, the program's requirements stipul

Cyber criminals are using a previously undocumented phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit called  Caffeine  to effectively scale up their attacks and distribute nefarious payloads.  "This platform has an intuitive interface and comes at a relatively low cost while providing a multitude of features and tools to its criminal clients to orchestrate and automate core elements of their phishing campaigns," Mandiant  said  in a new report.  Some of the core features offered by the platform comprise the ability to craft customized phishing kits, manage redirect pages, dynamically generate URLs that host the payloads, and track the success of the campaigns.   The development comes a little over a month after Resecurity took the wraps off another PhaaS service dubbed  EvilProxy  that's offered for sale on dark web criminal forums.  But unlike EvilProxy, whose operators are known to vet prospective customers before activating the subscriptions, Caffeine is notable for running an o

A new piece of research has detailed the increasingly sophisticated nature of the malware toolset employed by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group named Earth Aughisky .  "Over the last decade, the group has continued to make adjustments in the tools and malware deployments on specific targets located in Taiwan and, more recently, Japan," Trend Micro  disclosed  in a technical profile last week.  Earth Aughisky, also known as  Taidoor , is a cyber espionage group that's known for its ability to abuse legitimate accounts, software, applications, and other weaknesses in the network design and infrastructure for its own ends.  While the Chinese threat actor has been known to primarily target organizations in Taiwan, victimology patterns observed towards late 2017 indicate an expansion to Japan.   The most commonly targeted industry verticals include government, telcom, manufacturing, heavy, technology, transportation, and healthcare.  Attack chains mounted by the group

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the notorious Emotet malware are continually shifting their tactics and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to escape detection, according to new research from VMware.  Emotet  is the work of a threat actor tracked as Mummy Spider (aka TA542), emerging in June 2014 as a banking trojan before morphing into an all-purpose loader in 2016 that's capable of delivering second-stage payloads such as ransomware.  While the botnet's infrastructure was  taken down  as part of a coordinated law enforcement operation in January 2021, Emotet bounced back in November 2021 through another malware known as  TrickBot .  Emotet's resurrection, orchestrated by the now-defunct Conti team, has since paved the way for Cobalt Strike infections and, more recently, ransomware attacks involving  Quantum and BlackCat .   "The ongoing adaptation of Emotet's execution chain is one reason the malware has been successful for so long," researchers from VMwa

Chipmaker Intel has confirmed that proprietary source code related to its Alder Lake CPUs has been leaked, following its release by an unknown third-party on 4chan and GitHub last week.  The published content contains Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) code for  Alder Lake , the company's 12th generation processors that was originally launched in November 2021.  In a statement shared with Tom's Hardware, Intel  said  the leak doesn't expose "any new security vulnerabilities as we do not rely on obfuscation of information as a security measure."   It's also encouraging the broader security research community to report any potential issues through its  bug bounty program , adding it's reaching out to customers to notify them of the matter.  Besides the UEFI code, the leaked data dump includes a plethora of files and tools, some of which appear to come from firmware vendor Insyde Software.

BNB Chain, a blockchain linked to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, disclosed an exploit on a cross-chain bridge that drained around $100 million in digital assets.  "There was an exploit affecting the native cross-chain bridge between BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2) and BNB Smart Chain (BEP20 or BSC), known as 'BSC Token Hub,'" it  said  last week. "The exploit was through a sophisticated forging of the low level proof into one common library."  According to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, the exploit on the cross-chain bridge " resulted in extra BNB ," prompting a  temporary suspension  of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).   "BNB, which stands for 'Build and Build' (formerly called Binance Coin), is the blockchain gas token that 'fuels' transactions on BNB Chain," Binance  noted  earlier this February.  No user funds are said to have been impacted, since the vulnerability in the BSC Token Hub bridge enabled the unknown threat actor

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A severe remote code execution vulnerability in Zimbra's enterprise collaboration software and email platform is being actively exploited, with no patch currently available to remediate the issue.  The shortcoming, assigned  CVE-2022-41352 , carries a critical-severity rating of CVSS 9.8, providing a pathway for attackers to upload arbitrary files and carry out malicious actions on affected installations.  "The vulnerability is due to the method ( cpio ) in which Zimbra's antivirus engine ( Amavis ) scans inbound emails," cybersecurity firm Rapid7  said  in an analysis published this week.   The issue is said to have been abused since early September 2022, according to  details  shared on Zimbra forums. While a fix is yet to be released, the software services company is urging users to install the "pax" utility and restart the Zimbra services.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Understanding the connection between GRC and cybersecurity  When talking about cybersecurity, Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) is often considered the least exciting part of business protection. However, its importance can't be ignored, and this is why.   While cybersecurity focuses on the technical side of protecting systems, networks, devices, and data, GRC is the tool that will help the entire organization understand and communicate how to do it.  What does it mean?  GRC tools like StandardFusion help companies  define and implement the best practices, procedures, and governance to ensure everyone understands the risks associated with their actions and how they can affect business security, compliance, and success.  In simple words, GRC is the medium for creating awareness around cybersecurity's best practices to reduce risks and achieve business goals.  Why is cybersecurity more relevant than ever before  Cybersecurity aims to protect sensitive business data, intelle

Multiple campaigns that distributed trojanized and typosquatted packages on the NPM open source repository have been identified as the work of a single threat actor dubbed LofyGang .  Checkmarx said it discovered 199 rogue packages totaling thousands of installations, with the group operating for over a year with the goal of stealing credit card data as well as user accounts associated with Discord Nitro, gaming, and streaming services.  "LofyGang operators are seen promoting their hacking tools in hacking forums, while some of the tools are shipped with a hidden backdoor," the software security company said in a report shared with The Hacker News prior to its publication.   Various pieces of the attack puzzle have already been reported by  JFrog ,  Sonatype , and  Kaspersky  (which called it LofyLife), but the latest analysis pulls the various operations together under one organizational umbrella that Checkmarx is referring to as  LofyGang .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's a new phishing technique, it has been demonstrated that the Application Mode feature in Chromium-based web browsers can be abused to create "realistic desktop phishing applications."  Application Mode is designed to offer native-like experiences in a manner that causes the website to be launched in a separate browser window, while also displaying the website's favicon and hiding the address bar.  According to security researcher mr.d0x – who also devised the browser-in-the-browser ( BitB ) attack method earlier this year – a bad actor can leverage this behavior to resort to some HTML/CSS trickery and display a fake address bar on top of the window and fool users into giving up their credentials on rogue login forms.   "Although this technique is meant more towards internal phishing, you can technically still use it in an external phishing scenario," mr.d0x  said . "You can deliver these fake applications independently as files."  This is

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In yet another case of bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) attack, the operators of the BlackByte ransomware are leveraging a flaw in a legitimate Windows driver to bypass security solutions.  "The evasion technique supports disabling a whopping list of over 1,000 drivers on which security products rely to provide protection," Sophos threat researcher Andreas Klopsch  said  in a new technical write-up.  BYOVD is an  attack technique  that involves threat actors abusing vulnerabilities in legitimate, signed drivers to achieve successful kernel-mode exploitation and seize control of compromised machines.   Weaknesses in signed drivers have been increasingly co-opted by nation-state threat groups in recent years, including  Slingshot ,  InvisiMole ,  APT28 , and most recently, the  Lazarus Group .   BlackByte, believed to be an offshoot of the  now-discontinued Conti group , is part of the big game cybercrime crews, which zeroes in on large, high-profile targets as part of

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have shared details about a now-addressed security flaw in Apple's macOS operating system that could be potentially exploited to run malicious applications in a manner that can bypass Apple's security measures.  The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2022-32910 , is rooted in the built-in Archive Utility and "could lead to the execution of an unsigned and unnotarized application without displaying security prompts to the user, by using a specially crafted archive," Apple device management firm Jamf  said in an analysis.   Following responsible disclosure on May 31, 2022, Apple addressed the issue as part of  macOS Big Sur 11.6.8  and  Monterey 12.5  released on July 20, 2022. The tech giant, for its part, also revised the earlier-issued advisories as of October 4 to add an entry for the flaw.  Apple described the bug as a logic issue that could allow an archive file to get around Gatekeeper checks, which is designed so as to ensure that only trusted

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
It's been a year since the release of The Ultimate SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) Checklist. If SSPM is on your radar, here's the 2023 checklist edition, which covers the critical features and capabilities when evaluating a solution.  The ease with which SaaS apps can be deployed and adopted today is remarkable, but it has become a double-edged sword. On the one hand, apps are quickly onboarded, employees can work from anywhere, and there is little need for operational management. On the other hand, there are pain points that stem from the explosion of SaaS app usage, explained by the "3 V" s:   Volume:  Each app can have hundreds of global settings. Multiply this number by thousands – or tens (or even hundreds) of thousands – of employees. Security teams must first be able to discover all the users who are using each application, as well as familiarize themselves with  every  application's specific set of rules and configurations, and ensure they are co

19-Year-Old Teen Arrested for Using Leaked Optus Breach Data in SMS Scam<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/19-year-old-hacker-arrested-for-using.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Australian Federal Police (AFP) has arrested a 19-year-old teen from Sydney for allegedly attempting to leverage the data leaked following the Optus data breach late last month to extort victims.  The suspect is said to have carried out a text message blackmail scam, demanding that the recipients transfer $2,000 to a bank account or risk getting their personal information misused for fraudulent activities.  The source of the data, the agency said, was a sample database of 10,200 records that was posted briefly on a cybercrime forum accessible on the clearnet by an actor named "optusdata," before taking it down.   Details of the scam were  previously shared  by 9News Australia reporter Chris O'Keefe on September 27, 2022.  The AFP further said it executed a search warrant at the home of the offender, leading to the seizure of a mobile phone used to send the text messages to about 93 Optus customers. "At this stage it appears none of the individuals who received t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A U.S. federal court jury has found former Uber Chief Security Officer Joseph Sullivan  guilty of not disclosing a 2016 breach of customer and driver records to regulators and attempting to cover up the incident.  Sullivan has been convicted on two counts: One for obstructing justice by not reporting the incident and another for misprision. He faces a maximum of five years in prison for the obstruction charge, and a maximum of three years for the latter.  "Technology companies in the Northern District of California collect and store vast amounts of data from users," U.S. Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds  said  in a press statement.  "We expect those companies to protect that data and to alert customers and appropriate authorities when such data is stolen by hackers. Sullivan affirmatively worked to hide the data breach from the Federal Trade Commission and took steps to prevent the hackers from being caught."  The 2016 hack of Uber occurred as a result of two hackers ga

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A novel Android malware called RatMilad has been observed targeting a Middle Eastern enterprise mobile device by concealing itself as a VPN and phone number spoofing app.  The mobile trojan functions as advanced spyware with capabilities that receives and executes commands to collect and exfiltrate a wide variety of data from the infected mobile endpoint, Zimperium  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Evidence gathered by the mobile security company shows that the malicious app is distributed through links on social media and communication tools like Telegram, tricking unsuspecting users into sideloading the app and granting it extensive permissions.   The idea behind embedding the malware within a fake VPN and phone number spoofing service is also clever in that the app claims to enable users to verify social media accounts via phone, a technique popular in countries where access is restricted.  "Once installed and in control, the attackers could access the camera to

Australia's largest telecommunications company Telstra disclosed that it was the victim of a data breach through a third-party, nearly two weeks after Optus reported a breach of its own.  "There has been no breach of Telstra's systems," Narelle Devine, the company's chief information security officer for the Asia Pacific region,  said . "And no customer account data was involved."   It said the breach targeted a third-party platform called  Work Life NAB  that's no longer actively used by the company, and that the leaked data posted on the internet concerned a "now-obsolete Telstra employee rewards program."   Telstra also noted it became aware of the breach last week, adding the information included first and last names and the email addresses used to sign up for the program. It further clarified that the data posted was from 2017.  The data was "basic in nature," Devine said.    The company did not reveal how many employees wer

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies on Tuesday disclosed that multiple nation-state hacking groups potentially targeted a "Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organization's enterprise network" as part of a cyber espionage campaign.  "[Advanced persistent threat] actors used an open-source toolkit called  Impacket  to gain their foothold within the environment and further compromise the network, and also used a custom data exfiltration tool, CovalentStealer, to steal the victim's sensitive data," the authorities  said .   The  joint advisory , which was authored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Security Agency (NSA), said the adversaries likely had long-term access to the compromised environment.  The findings are the result of CISA's incident response efforts in collaboration with a trusted third-party security firm from November 2021 through January 20

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Professional developers want to do the right thing, but in terms of security, they are rarely set up for success. Organizations must support their upskilling with precision training and incentives if they want secure software from the ground up.  The cyber threat landscape grows more complex by the day, with our data widely considered highly desirable "digital gold". Attackers are constantly scanning networks for vulnerable applications, programs, cloud instances, and the latest flavor of the month is APIs, with Gartner  correctly predicting  that they would become the most common attack vector in 2022, and that is in no small part thanks to their often lax security controls.   Threat actors are so persistent that new apps can sometimes be compromised and exploited within hours of deployment. The  Verizon 2022 Data Breach Investigations Report  reveals that errors and misconfigurations were the cause of 13% of breaches, with the human element responsible overall for 82% of the 23,000

A former affiliate of the Netwalker ransomware has been sentenced to 20 years in prison in the U.S., a little over three months after the  Canadian national pleaded guilty  to his role in the crimes.  Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, 35, has also been ordered to forfeit $21,500,000 that was illicitly obtained from dozens of victims globally, including companies, municipalities, hospitals, law enforcement, emergency services, school districts, colleges, and universities.  Launched in 2019, the Netwalker attacks particularly singled out the healthcare sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, opportunistically taking advantage of the situation to extort money from victims.   "The defendant in this case used sophisticated technological means to exploit hundreds of victims in numerous countries at the height of an international health crisis," U.S. Attorney Roger B. Handberg for the Middle District of Florida  said .  Vachon-Desjardins, an IT engineer working for the Canadian government

Mitigation for Exchange Zero-Days Bypassed! Microsoft Issues New Workarounds<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/mitigation-for-exchange-zero-days.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has revised its mitigation measures for the newly disclosed and actively exploited zero-day flaws in Exchange Server after it was found that they could be trivially bypassed.  The two vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082, have been codenamed  ProxyNotShell  due to similarities to another set of flaws called  ProxyShell , which the tech giant resolved last year.  In-the-wild attacks abusing the  shortcomings  have chained the two flaws to gain remote code execution on compromised servers with elevated privileges, leading to the deployment of web shells.  The Windows maker, which is yet to release a fix for the bugs, has acknowledged that a single state-sponsored threat actor may have been weaponizing the flaws since August 2022 in limited targeted attacks.   In the meantime, the company has made available temporary workarounds to reduce the risk of exploitation by restricting known attack patterns through a rule in the IIS Manager.  However, according

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A popular Chinese-language YouTube channel has emerged as a means to distribute a trojanized version of a Windows installer for the Tor Browser.  Kaspersky  dubbed  the campaign  OnionPoison , with all of the victims located in China. The scale of the attack remains unclear, but the Russian cybersecurity company said it detected victims appearing in its telemetry in March 2022.  The malicious version of the Tor Browser installer is being distributed via a link present in the description of a video that was uploaded to YouTube on January 9, 2022. It has been viewed over 64,500 times to date.   The channel hosting the video has 181,000 subscribers and claims to be based in Hong Kong. The video is still available to watch on the social media platform as of writing.  The attack banks on the fact that the actual Tor Browser website is blocked in China, thus tricking unsuspecting users searching for "Tor浏览器" (i.e., Tor Browser in Chinese) on YouTube into potentially downloading th

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed details about a now-patched high-severity security flaw in Packagist, a PHP software package repository, that could have been exploited to mount software supply chain attacks.  "This vulnerability allows gaining control of  Packagist ," SonarSource researcher Thomas Chauchefoin  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. Packagist is used by the PHP package manager Composer to determine and download software dependencies that are included by developers in their projects.  The disclosure comes as planting malware in open source repositories is turning into an attractive conduit for mounting  software supply chain attacks .   Tracked as  CVE-2022-24828  (CVSS score: 8.8), the  issue  has been described as a case of command injection and is linked to another similar Composer bug ( CVE-2021-29472 ) that came to light in April 2021, suggesting an inadequate patch.

A big promise with a big appeal. You hear that a lot in the world of cybersecurity, where you're often promised a fast, simple fix that will take care of all your cybersecurity needs, solving your security challenges in one go.   It could be an AI-based tool, a new superior management tool, or something else – and it would probably be quite effective at what it promises to do.  But is it a silver bullet for all your cybersecurity problems? No. There's no easy, technology-driven fix for what is really cybersecurity's biggest challenge: the actions of human beings.   It doesn't matter how state-of-the-art your best defenses are. Perimeter firewalls, multi-tiered logins, multi-factor authentication, AI tools – all of these are easily rendered ineffective when Bob from a nondescript department clicks on a phishing link in an email.

A 46-year-old man in the U.S. has been sentenced to 25 years in prison after being found guilty of laundering over $9.5 million accrued by carrying out cyber-enabled financial fraud.  Elvis Eghosa Ogiekpolor of Norcross, Georgia, operated a money laundering network that opened at least 50 business bank accounts for illicitly receiving funds from unsuspecting individuals and businesses after falling victim to romance frauds and business email compromise ( BEC ) scams.  Ogiekpolor was charged by a federal grand jury in February 2022 with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and 15 counts of substantive money laundering. The scheme was operational from October 2018 to August 2020.   According to the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ), Ogiekpolor enlisted the help of eight "money mules" to open the phony bank accounts under the names of non-existent companies, which were subsequently used to stash the proceeds from their criminal activities.  These included creating fic

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a new Binding Operational Directive (BOD) that directs federal agencies in the country to keep track of assets and vulnerabilities on their networks six months from now.  To that end, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) enterprises have been tasked with two sets of activities: Asset discovery and vulnerability enumeration, which are seen as essential steps to gain "greater visibility into risks facing federal civilian networks."   This  involves  carrying out automated asset discovery every seven days and initiating vulnerability enumeration across those discovered assets every 14 days by April 3, 2023, in addition to having the capabilities to do so on an on-demand basis within 72 hours of receiving a request from CISA.  Similar baseline vulnerability enumeration obligations have also been put in place for Android and iOS devices as well as other devices that reside outside of agency on-premise

A threat actor likely with associations to China has been attributed to a new supply chain attack that involves the use of a trojanized installer for the Comm100 Live Chat application to distribute a JavaScript backdoor.  Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said the attack made use of a signed Comm100 desktop agent app for Windows that was downloadable from the company's website.

The recently discovered Linux-Based ransomware strain known as Cheerscrypt has been attributed to a Chinese cyber espionage group known for operating short-lived ransomware schemes .  Cybersecurity firm Sygnia attributed the attacks to a threat actor it tracks under the name Emperor Dragonfly, which is also known as Bronze Starlight (Secureworks) and DEV-0401 (Microsoft).  "Emperor Dragonfly deployed open source tools that were written by Chinese developers for Chinese users," the company said in a report  shared with The Hacker News. "This reinforces claims that the 'Emperor Dragonfly' ransomware operators are based in China."   The use of Cheerscrypt is the latest addition to a long list of ransomware families previously deployed by the group in little over a year, including LockFile, Atom Silo, Rook, Night Sky, Pandora, and LockBit 2.0.

The North Korea-backed Lazarus Group has been observed deploying a Windows rootkit by taking advantage of an exploit in a Dell firmware driver, highlighting new tactics adopted by the state-sponsored adversary.  The Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver ( BYOVD ) attack, which took place in the autumn of 2021, is another variant of the threat actor's espionage-oriented activity called Operation In(ter)ception  that's directed against aerospace and defense industries.  "The campaign started with spear-phishing emails containing malicious Amazon-themed documents and targeted an employee of an aerospace company in the Netherlands, and a political journalist in Belgium," ESET researcher Peter Kálnai  said .   Attack chains unfolded upon the opening of the lure documents, leading to the distribution of malicious droppers that were trojanized versions of open source projects, corroborating recent reports from Google's  Mandiant  and  Microsoft .

A former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) employee has been arrested on charges of attempting to sell classified information to a foreign spy, who was actually an undercover agent working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Jareh Sebastian Dalke, 30, was employed at the NSA for less than a month from June 6, 2022, to July 1, 2022, serving as an Information Systems Security Designer as part of a temporary assignment in Washington D.C.  According to an  affidavit  filed by the FBI, Dalke was also a member of the U.S. Army from about 2015 to 2018 and held a Secret security clearance, which he received in 2016.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Friday disclosed that a single activity group in August 2022 achieved initial access and breached Exchange servers by chaining the  two newly disclosed zero-day flaws  in a limited set of attacks aimed at less than 10 organizations globally.  "These attacks installed the Chopper web shell to facilitate hands-on-keyboard access, which the attackers used to perform Active Directory reconnaissance and data exfiltration," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)  said  in a new analysis.  The weaponization of the vulnerabilities is expected to ramp up in the coming days, Microsoft further warned, as malicious actors co-opt the exploits into their toolkits, including deploying ransomware, due to the "highly privileged access Exchange systems confer onto an attacker."  The tech giant attributed the ongoing attacks with medium confidence to a state-sponsored organization, adding it was already investigating these attacks when the Zero Day Initiative d

CISA Warns of Hackers Exploiting Critical Atlassian Bitbucket Server Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/cisa-warns-of-hackers-exploiting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday  added  a recently disclosed critical flaw impacting Atlassian's Bitbucket Server and Data Center to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-36804 , the issue relates to a command injection vulnerability that could allow malicious actors to gain arbitrary code execution on susceptible installations by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.  Successful exploitation, however, banks on the prerequisite that the attacker already has access to a public repository or possesses read permissions to a private Bitbucket repository.   "All versions of Bitbucket Server and Datacenter released after 6.10.17 including 7.0.0 and newer are affected, this means that all instances that are running any versions between 7.0.0 and 8.3.0 inclusive are affected by this vulnerability," Atlassian  noted  in a late August 2022 advisory.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors have been found deploying never-before-seen post-compromise implants in VMware's virtualization software to seize control of infected systems and evade detection.  Google's Mandiant threat intelligence division referred to it as a "novel malware ecosystem" that impacts VMware ESXi, Linux vCenter servers, and Windows virtual machines, allowing attackers to maintain persistent access to the  hypervisor  as well as execute arbitrary commands.  The  hyperjacking attacks , per the cybersecurity vendor, involved the use of malicious vSphere Installation Bundles ( VIBs ) to sneak in two implants, dubbed VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE, on the ESXi hypervisors.   "It is important to highlight that this is not an external remote code execution vulnerability; the attacker needs admin-level privileges to the ESXi hypervisor before they can deploy malware," Mandiant researchers Alexander Marvi, Jeremy Koppen, Tufail Ahmed, and Jonathan Lepore said in an exhaus

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An espionage-focused threat actor has been observed using a steganographic trick to conceal a previously undocumented backdoor in a Windows logo in its attacks against Middle Eastern governments.  Broadcom's Symantec Threat Hunter Team attributed the updated tooling to a hacking group it tracks under the name  Witchetty , which is also known as  LookingFrog , a subgroup operating under the TA410 umbrella.  Intrusions involving TA410 – which is believed to share connections with a Chinese threat group known as APT10 (aka Cicada, Stone Panda, or TA429) – primarily feature a modular implant called LookBack.   Symantec's latest analysis of attacks between February and September 2022, during which the group targeted the governments of two Middle Eastern countries and the stock exchange of an African nation, highlights the use of a new backdoor called Stegmap.  The new malware leverages  steganography  – a technique used to embed a message (in this case, malware) in a non-secret doc

A social engineering campaign leveraging job-themed lures is weaponizing a years-old remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons on compromised hosts.  "The payload discovered is a leaked version of a Cobalt Strike beacon," Cisco Talos researchers Chetan Raghuprasad and Vanja Svajcer  said  in a new analysis published Wednesday.  "The beacon configuration contains commands to perform targeted process injection of arbitrary binaries and has a high reputation domain configured, exhibiting the redirection technique to masquerade the beacon's traffic."   The malicious activity, discovered in August 2022, attempts to exploit the vulnerability  CVE-2017-0199 , a remote code execution issue in Microsoft Office, that allows an attacker to take control of an affected system.  The entry vector for the attack is a phishing email containing a Microsoft Word attachment that employs job-themed lures for roles in the U.S. government and Publ

Endpoint devices like desktops, laptops, and mobile phones enable users to connect to enterprise networks and use their resources for their day-to-day work. However, they also expand the attack surface and make the organisation vulnerable to malicious cyberattacks and data breaches.  Why Modern Organisations Need EDR  According to the 2020 global  risk report  by Ponemon Institute, smartphones, laptops, mobile devices, and desktops are some of the most vulnerable entry points that allow threat actors to compromise enterprise networks. Security teams must assess and address the security risks created by these devices before they can damage the organisation. And for this, they require Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR).  EDR solutions provide real-time visibility into endpoints and detect threats like malware and ransomware. By continuously monitoring endpoints, they enable security teams to uncover malicious activities, investigate threats, and initiate appropriate responses to pr

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft officially disclosed it investigating two zero-day security vulnerabilities impacting Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and 2019 following  reports of in-the-wild exploitation .  "The first vulnerability, identified as  CVE-2022-41040 , is a Server-Side Request Forgery ( SSRF ) vulnerability, while the second, identified as  CVE-2022-41082 , allows remote code execution (RCE) when PowerShell is accessible to the attacker," the tech giant  said .  The company also confirmed that it's aware of "limited targeted attacks" weaponizing the flaws to obtain initial access to targeted systems, but emphasized that authenticated access to the vulnerable Exchange Server is required to achieve successful exploitation.  The attacks detailed by Microsoft show that the two flaws are stringed together in an exploit chain, with the SSRF bug enabling an authenticated adversary to remotely trigger arbitrary code execution.   The Redmond-based company also confirmed that it'

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers are warning of previously undisclosed flaws in fully patched Microsoft Exchange servers being exploited by malicious actors in real-world attacks to achieve remote code execution on affected systems.  That's according to Vietnamese cybersecurity company GTSC, which discovered the shortcomings as part of its security monitoring and incident response efforts in August 2022.  The two vulnerabilities, which are formally yet to be assigned CVE identifiers, are being  tracked  by the Zero Day Initiative as  ZDI-CAN-18333  (CVSS score: 8.8) and  ZDI-CAN-18802  (CVSS score: 6.3).  GTSC said that successful exploitation of the flaws could be abused to gain a foothold in the victim's systems, enabling adversaries to drop web shells and carry out lateral movements across the compromised network.   "We detected web shells, mostly obfuscated, being dropped to Exchange servers," the company  noted . "Using the user-agent, we detected that the attacker use

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Brazilian threat actor known as  Prilex  has resurfaced after a year-long operational hiatus with an advanced and complex malware to steal money by means of fraudulent transactions.  "The Prilex group has shown a high level of knowledge about credit and debit card transactions, and how software used for payment processing works," Kaspersky researchers  said . "This enables the attackers to keep updating their tools in order to find a way to circumvent the authorization policies, allowing them to perform their attacks."  The cybercrime group emerged on the scene with ATM-focused malware attacks in the South American nation, providing it the ability to break into ATM machines to perform jackpotting – a type of attack aiming to dispense cash illegitimately – and clone thousands of credit cards to steal funds from the targeted bank's customers.   Prilex's modus operandi over the years has since evolved to take advantage of processes relating to point-of-sale

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new covert attack campaign singled out multiple military and weapons contractor companies with spear-phishing emails to trigger a multi-stage infection process designed to deploy an unknown payload on compromised machines.  The highly-targeted intrusions, dubbed  STEEP#MAVERICK  by Securonix, also targeted a strategic supplier to the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft.  "The attack was carried out starting in late summer 2022 targeting at least two high-profile military contractor companies," Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov  said  in an analysis.   Infection chains begin with a phishing mail with a ZIP archive attachment containing a shortcut file that claims to be a PDF document about "Company & Benefits," which is then used to retrieve a stager -- an initial binary that's used to download the desired malware -- from a remote server.  This PowerShell stager sets the stage for a "robust chain of stagers" that progresses through seven m

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Every year, billions of credentials appear online, be it on the dark web, clear web, paste sites, or in data dumps shared by cybercriminals. These credentials are often used for account takeover attacks, exposing organizations to breaches, ransomware, and data theft.   While CISOs are aware of growing identity threats and have multiple tools in their arsenal to help reduce the potential risk, the reality is that existing methodologies have proven largely ineffective. According to the  2022 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report , over 60% of breaches involve compromised credentials.   Attackers use techniques such as social engineering, brute force, and purchasing leaked credentials on the dark web to compromise legitimate identities and gain unauthorized access to victim organizations' systems and resources.   Adversaries often leverage the fact that some passwords are shared among different users, making it easier to breach multiple accounts in the same organization.

Several hacktivist groups are using Telegram and other tools to aid anti-government protests in Iran to bypass regime censorship restrictions amid  ongoing unrest  in the country following the death of Mahsa Amini in custody.  "Key activities are data leaking and selling, including officials' phone numbers and emails, and maps of sensitive locations," Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point  said  in a new report.   The company said it has also witnessed sharing of proxies and open VPN servers to get around censorship and reports on the internet status in the country, with one group helping the anti-government demonstrators access social media sites.  Chief among them is a Telegram channel called Official Atlas Intelligence Group (AIG) that's primarily focused on publishing data associated with government officials as well as maps of prominent locations.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new, multi-functional Go-based malware dubbed  Chaos  has been rapidly growing in volume in recent months to ensnare a wide range of Windows, Linux, small office/home office (SOHO) routers, and enterprise servers into its botnet.  "Chaos functionality includes the ability to enumerate the host environment, run remote shell commands, load additional modules, automatically propagate through stealing and brute-forcing SSH private keys, as well as launch DDoS attacks," researchers from Lumen's Black Lotus Labs  said  in a write-up shared with The Hacker News.  A majority of the bots are located in Europe, specifically Italy, with other infections reported in China and the U.S., collectively representing "hundreds of unique IP addresses" over a one-month time period from mid-June through mid-July 2022.   Written in Chinese and leveraging China-based infrastructure for command-and-control, the botnet joins a long list of malware that are designed to establish persi

A recently discovered malware builder called Quantum Builder is being used to deliver the Agent Tesla remote access trojan (RAT).  "This campaign features enhancements and a shift toward LNK (Windows shortcut) files when compared to similar attacks in the past," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Niraj Shivtarkar and Avinash Kumar  said  in a Tuesday write-up.   Sold on the dark web for €189 a month,  Quantum Builder  is a customizable tool for generating malicious shortcut files as well as HTA, ISO, and PowerShell payloads to deliver next-stage malware on the targeted machines, in this case  Agent Tesla .  The multi-stage attack chain starts with a spear-phishing containing a GZIP archive attachment that includes a shortcut designed to execute PowerShell code responsible for launching a remote HTML application (HTA) using  MSHTA .

Organizations struggle to find ways to keep a good security posture. This is because it is difficult to create secure system policies and find the right tools that help achieve a good posture. In many cases, organizations work with tools that do not integrate with each other and are expensive to purchase and maintain.  Security posture management is a term used to describe the process of identifying and mitigating security misconfigurations and compliance risks in an organization. To maintain a good security posture, organizations should at least do the following:   Maintain inventory:  Asset inventory is considered first because it provides a comprehensive list of all IT assets that should be protected. This includes the hardware devices, applications, and services that are being used.  Perform vulnerability assessment:  The next step is to perform a vulnerability assessment to identify weaknesses in applications and services. Knowledge of the vulnerabilities help to prioritize risks

The Russian state-sponsored threat actor known as  APT28  has been found leveraging a new code execution method that makes use of mouse movement in decoy Microsoft PowerPoint documents to deploy malware.  The technique "is designed to be triggered when the user starts the presentation mode and moves the mouse," cybersecurity firm Cluster25  said  in a technical report. "The code execution runs a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a dropper from OneDrive."   The dropper, a seemingly harmless image file, functions as a pathway for a follow-on payload, a variant of a malware known as Graphite, which uses the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive for command-and-control (C2) communications to retrieve additional payloads.  The attack employs a lure document that makes use of a template potentially linked to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ), a Paris-based intergovernmental entity.

"The largest and most complex Russian operation we've disrupted since the war in Ukraine began, it ran a sprawling network of over 60 websites impersonating news organizations, as well as accounts on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Telegram, Twitter, Change.org and Avaaz, and even LiveJournal," the social media behemoth  said .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WhatsApp has released  security updates  to address two flaws in its messaging app for Android and iOS that could lead to remote code execution on vulnerable devices.  One of them concerns  CVE-2022-36934  (CVSS score: 9.8), a critical integer overflow vulnerability in WhatsApp that results in the execution of arbitrary code simply by establishing a video call.  The issue impacts the WhatsApp and WhatsApp Business for Android and iOS prior to versions 2.22.16.12.   Also patched by the Meta-owned messaging platform is an integer underflow bug, which refers to an opposite category of errors that occur when the result of an operation is too small for storing the value within the allocated memory space.  The high-severity issue, given the CVE identifier  CVE-2022-27492  (CVSS score: 7.8), affects WhatsApp for Android prior to versions 2.22.16.2 and WhatsApp for iOS version 2.22.15.9, and could be triggered upon receiving a specially crafted video file.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Ukrainian government on Monday warned of "massive cyberattacks" by Russia targeting critical infrastructure facilities located in the country and that of its allies.  The attacks are said to be targeting the energy sector, the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine (GUR) said.  "By the cyberattacks, the enemy will try to increase the effect of missile strikes on electricity supply facilities, primarily in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine," the agency  said  in a brief advisory.   GUR also cautioned of intensified distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks aimed at the critical infrastructure of Ukraine's closest allies, chiefly Poland and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.  It's not immediately clear what prompted the intelligence agency to issue the notice, but Ukraine has been at the receiving end of  disruptive and destructive cyberattacks  since the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war earli

Cybercriminals are continuing to prey on users searching for cracked software by directing them to fraudulent websites hosting weaponized installers that deploy malware called  NullMixer  on compromised systems.  "When a user extracts and executes NullMixer, it drops a number of malware files to the compromised machine," cybersecurity firm Kaspersky said in a Monday report. "It drops a wide variety of malicious binaries to infect the machine with, such as backdoors, bankers, downloaders, spyware, and many others."  Besides siphoning users' credentials, address, credit card data, cryptocurrencies, and even Facebook and Amazon account session cookies, what makes NullMixer insidious is its ability to download dozens of trojans at once, significantly widening the scale of the infections.   Attack chains typically start when a user attempts to download cracked software from one of the sites, which leads to a password-protected archive that contains an executable fil

As many as 75 apps on Google Play and 10 on Apple App Store have been discovered engaging in ad fraud as part of an ongoing campaign that commenced in 2019.  The latest iteration, dubbed  Scylla  by Online fraud-prevention firm HUMAN Security, follows similar attack waves in August 2019 and late 2020 that go by the codename Poseidon and Charybdis, respectively.  Prior to their removal from the app storefronts, the apps had been collectively installed more than 13 million times.   The original Poseidon operation comprised over 40 Android apps that were designed to display ads out of context or hidden from the view of the device user.  Charybdis, on the other hand, was an improvement over the former by making use of code obfuscation tactics to target advertising platforms.   Scylla presents the latest adaption of the scheme in that it expands beyond Android to make a foray into the iOS ecosystem for the first time, alongside relying on additional layers of code roundabout using the  All

The global cybersecurity market is flourishing. Experts at Gartner predict that the end-user spending for the information security and risk management market will grow from $172.5 billion in 2022 to $267.3 billion in 2026.   One big area of spending includes the art of putting cybersecurity defenses under pressure, commonly known as security testing. MarketsandMarkets forecasts the global penetration testing (pentesting) market size is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 13.7% from 2022 to 2027. However, the costs and limitations involved in carrying out a penetration test are already hindering the market growth, and consequently, many cybersecurity professionals are making moves to find an alternative solution.  Pentests aren't solving cybersecurity pain points  Pentesting can serve specific and important purposes for businesses.

Hackers often start out with nothing more than a low-level user account and then work to gain additional privileges that will allow them to take over the network. One of the methods that is commonly used to acquire these privileges is a pass-the-hash attack. Here are five steps to prevent a pass-the-hash attack in a Windows domain.

The infamous Lazarus Group has continued its pattern of leveraging unsolicited job opportunities to deploy malware targeting Apple's macOS operating system.  In the latest variant of the campaign observed by cybersecurity company SentinelOne last week, decoy documents advertising positions for the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange firm Crypto[.]com have been used to mount the attacks.  The latest disclosure builds on previous findings from Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET in August, which  delved  into a similar phony job posting for the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange platform.   Both these fake job advertisements are just the latest in a series of attacks dubbed  Operation In(ter)ception , which, in turn, is a constituent of a broader campaign tracked under the name  Operation Dream Job .  Although the exact distribution vector for the malware remains unknown, it's suspected that potential targets are singled out via direct messages on the business networking site Linke

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Australian Federal Police (AFP) on Monday disclosed it's working to gather "crucial evidence" and that it's collaborating with overseas law enforcement authorities following the hack of telecom provider Optus.  "Operation Hurricane has been launched to identify the criminals behind the alleged breach and to help shield Australians from identity fraud," the AFP  said  in a statement.  The development comes after Optus, Australia's second-largest wireless carrier,  disclosed  on September 22, 2022, that it was a victim of a cyberattack. It claimed it "immediately shut down the attack" as soon as it came to light.   The threat actor behind the breach also briefly released a sample of 10,200 records from the breach – putting those users at heightened risk of fraud – in addition to asking for $1 million as part of an extortion demand. The dataset has since been taken down, with the attacker also claiming to have deleted the only copy of the sto

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
At least three alleged hacktivist groups working in support of Russian interests are likely doing so in collaboration with state-sponsored cyber threat actors, according to Mandiant.  The Google-owned threat intelligence and incident response firm  said  with moderate confidence that "moderators of the purported hacktivist Telegram channels 'XakNet Team,' 'Infoccentr,' and 'CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn' are coordinating their operations with Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)-sponsored cyber threat actors."  Mandiant's assessment is based on evidence that the leakage of data stolen from Ukrainian organizations occurred within 24 hours of  malicious wiper incidents  undertaken by the Russian nation-state group tracked as  APT28  (aka Fancy Bear, Sofacy, or Strontium).   To that end, four of the 16 data leaks from these groups coincided with  disk wiping malware attacks  by APT28 that involved the use of a strain dubbed  CaddyWiper .  APT28 , a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A China-aligned advanced persistent threat actor known as TA413 weaponized recently disclosed flaws in Sophos Firewall and Microsoft Office to deploy a never-before-seen backdoor called LOWZERO as part of an espionage campaign aimed at Tibetan entities.  Targets primarily consisted of organizations associated with the Tibetan community, including enterprises associated with the Tibetan government-in-exile.  The intrusions involved the exploitation of  CVE-2022-1040  and  CVE-2022-30190  (aka "Follina"), two remote code execution vulnerabilities in Sophos Firewall and Microsoft Office, respectively.   "This willingness to rapidly incorporate new techniques and methods of initial access contrasts with the group's continued use of well known and reported capabilities, such as the Royal Road RTF weaponizer, and often lax infrastructure procurement tendencies," Recorded Future  said  in a new technical analysis.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The  BlackCat ransomware crew  has been spotted fine-tuning their malware arsenal to fly under the radar and expand their reach.  "Among some of the more notable developments has been the use of a new version of the Exmatter data exfiltration tool, and the use of Eamfo, information-stealing malware that is designed to steal credentials stored by Veeam backup software," researchers from Symantec  said  in a new report.  BlackCat, also known by the names ALPHV and Noberus, is attributed to an adversary tracked as Coreid (aka  FIN7 , Carbanak, or Carbon Spider) and is said to be a  rebranded successor  of  DarkSide  and  BlackMatter , both of which shut shop last year following a string of high-profile attacks, including that of Colonial Pipeline.   The threat actor, like other notorious ransomware groups, is known to run a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation, which involves its core developers enlisting the help of affiliates to carry out the attacks in exchange for a cut

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity today matters so much because of everyone's dependence on technology, from collaboration, communication and collecting data to e-commerce and entertainment. Every organisation that needs to deliver services to their customers and employees must protect their IT 'network' - all the apps and connected devices from laptops and desktops to servers and smartphones.  While traditionally, these would all live on one "corporate network," - networks today are often just made up of the devices themselves, and how they're connected: across the internet, sometimes via VPNs, to the homes and cafes people work from, to the cloud and data centres where services live. So what threats does this modern network face?  Let's look at them in more detail.  #1 Misconfiguration  According to recent research by  Verizon , misconfiguration errors and misuse now make up 14% of breaches.

Wearable technology company Fitbit has announced a new clause that requires users to switch to a Google account "sometime" in 2023.  "In 2023, we plan to launch Google accounts on Fitbit, which will enable use of Fitbit with a Google account," the Google-owned fitness devices maker  said .   The switch will not go live for all users in 2023. Rather, support for Fitbit accounts is expected to continue until at least the beginning of 2025, after which a Google account will be mandatory for using the devices.  The deeper integration also means that a Google account will be compulsory to sign up for Fitbit and activate new features, including those that incorporate Google products and services such as Google Assistant.  Also necessitated as part of the transition is the consent from the part of users to move their personal data from Fitbit to Google. The internet giant  stressed that  users' personal information will not be used to serve ads.  The goal, Fitbit said

Ukrainian law enforcement authorities on Friday disclosed that it had "neutralized" a hacking group operating from the city of Lviv that it said acted on behalf of Russian interests.  The group specialized in the sales of 30 million accounts belonging to citizens from Ukraine and the European Union on the dark web and netted a profit of $372,000 (14 million UAH) through electronic payment systems like YooMoney, Qiwi, and WebMoney that are outlawed in the country.   "Their 'wholesale clients' were pro-kremlin propagandists," the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU)  said  in a press release. "It was them who used the received identification data of Ukrainian and foreign citizens to spread fake 'news' from the front and sow panic."

The department said the arrest was made as part of an investigation in partnership with the U.K. National Crime Agency's cyber crime unit.   No further details about the nature of the investigation were disclosed, although it's suspected that the law enforcement action may have something to do with the recent string of high-profile hacks aimed at  Uber  and  Rockstar Games .  Both the intrusions are alleged to have been committed by the same threat actor, who goes by the name Tea Pot (aka teapotuberhacker).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security software company Sophos has warned of cyberattacks targeting a recently addressed critical vulnerability in its firewall product.  The issue, tracked as  CVE-2022-3236  (CVSS score: 9.8), impacts Sophos Firewall v19.0 MR1 (19.0.1) and older and concerns a code injection vulnerability in the User Portal and Webadmin components that could result in remote code execution.  The company  said  it "has observed this vulnerability being used to target a small set of specific organizations, primarily in the South Asia region," adding it directly notified these entities.   As a workaround, Sophos is recommending that users take steps to ensure that the User Portal and Webadmin are not exposed to WAN. Alternatively, users can update to the latest supported version -   v19.5 GA  v19.0 MR2 (19.0.2)  v19.0 GA, MR1, and MR1-1  v18.5 MR5 (18.5.5)  v18.5 GA, MR1, MR1-1, MR2, MR3, and MR4  v18.0 MR3, MR4, MR5, and MR6  v17.5 MR12, MR13, MR14, MR15, MR16, and MR17  v17.0 MR10   Users

GitHub has put out an advisory detailing what may be an ongoing phishing campaign targeting its users to steal credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes by impersonating the CircleCI DevOps platform.  The Microsoft-owned code hosting service said it learned of the attack on September 16, 2022, adding the campaign impacted "many victim organizations."  The fraudulent messages claim to notify users that their CircleCI sessions have expired and that they should log in using GitHub credentials by clicking on a link.   Another bogus email  revealed by CircleCI  prompts users to sign in to their GitHub accounts to accept the company's new Terms of Use and Privacy Policy by following the link embedded in the message.  Regardless of the lure, doing so redirects the target to a lookalike GitHub login page designed to steal and exfiltrate the entered credentials as well as the Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) codes in real-time to the attacker, effectively allowing

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented threat actor of unknown origin has been linked to attacks targeting telecom, internet service providers, and universities across multiple countries in the Middle East and Africa.  "The operators are highly aware of operations security, managing carefully segmented infrastructure per victim, and quickly deploying intricate countermeasures in the presence of security solutions," researchers from SentinelOne  said  in a new report.   The cybersecurity firm codenamed the group  Metador  in reference to a string "I am meta" in one of their malware samples and because of Spanish-language responses from the command-and-control (C2) servers.  The threat actor is said to have primarily focused on the development of cross-platform malware in its pursuit of espionage aims. Other hallmarks of the campaign are the limited number of intrusions and long-term access to targets.   This includes two different Windows malware platforms called metaMain and Ma

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Thursday  added  a recently disclosed security flaw in Zoho ManageEngine to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) Catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation.  "Zoho ManageEngine PAM360, Password Manager Pro, and Access Manager Plus contain an unspecified vulnerability which allows for remote code execution," the agency said in a notice.   The  critical vulnerability , tracked as  CVE-2022-35405 , is rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS scoring system, and was patched by Zoho as part of updates released on June 24, 2022.  Although the exact nature of the flaw remains unknown, the India-based enterprise solutions company  said  it addressed the issue by removing the vulnerable components that could lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code.  Zoho has also warned of the public availability of a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for the vulnerability, making it imperative that customers move

What on earth were they thinking? That's what we – and other security experts – were wondering when content giant Patreon recently dismissed its entire internal cybersecurity team in exchange for outsourced services.  Of course, we don't know the true motivations for this move. But, as outsiders looking in, we can guess the cybersecurity implications of the decision would be inescapable for any organization.  Fire the internal team and you take a huge risk  Patreon is a content-creator site that handles billions of dollars in revenue. For reasons unknown to us, Patreon fired not just a couple of staff members or someone in middle management. No: the company fired its entire security team.   It's a big decision with significant consequences because it results in an incalculable loss of organizational knowledge. At the technical level, it's a loss of soft knowledge around deep system interdependencies that internal security experts will just "know" about and ac

A hack-for-hire group that was  first exposed in 2019  has expanded its focus to set its sights on entities with business or political ties to Russia.  Dubbed Void Balaur , the cyber mercenary collective has a history of launching cyberattacks against biotechnology and telecom companies since 2015. As many as 3,500 victims have been reported as of November 2021.  "Void Balaur [...] primarily dabbles in cyber espionage and data theft, selling the stolen information to anyone willing to pay," Trend Micro  noted  at the time.   Attacks conducted by the group are typically both generic and opportunistic and are aimed at gaining unauthorized access to widely-used email services, social media, messaging, and corporate accounts.   Earlier this June, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) took the wraps off a set of  credential theft attacks  targeting journalists, European politicians, and non-profit's mounted by the threat actor.

A new wave of a mobile surveillance campaign has been observed targeting the Uyghur community as part of a long-standing spyware operation active since at least 2015, cybersecurity researchers disclosed Thursday.  The intrusions, originally attributed to a threat actor named  Scarlet Mimic  back in January 2016, is said to have encompassed 20 different variants of the Android malware, which were disguised as book, pictures, and an audio version of the Quran.  The malware, while relatively unsophisticated from a technical standpoint, comes with extensive capabilities to steal sensitive data from an infected device, send SMS messages on the victim's behalf, make phone calls, and track their locations.   Additionally, it allows the recording of incoming and outgoing phone calls as well as surrounding audio.  "All this makes it a powerful and dangerous surveillance tool," Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point  said  in a technical deepdive, calling the spyware  MobileOrder

"The malicious Material Tailwind npm package, while posing as a helpful development tool, has an automatic post-install script," Karlo Zanki, security researcher at ReversingLabs,  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Last month Tech Crunch reported that  payment terminal manufacturer Wiseasy had been hacked . Although Wiseasy might not be well known in North America, their Android-based payment terminals are widely used in the Asia Pacific region and hackers managed to steal passwords for 140,000 payment terminals.  How Did the Wiseasy Hack Happen?  Wiseasy employees use a cloud-based dashboard for remotely managing payment terminals. This dashboard allows the company to perform a variety of configuration and management tasks such as managing payment terminal users, adding or removing apps, and even locking the terminal.   Hackers were able to gain access to the Wiseasy dashboard by infecting employee's computers with malware. This allowed hackers to gain access to two different employee's dashboards, ultimately leading to a massive harvesting of payment terminal credentials once they gained access.  Top Lessons Learned from the Wiseasy Hack  1 — Transparency isn't always the best policy   While i

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed a new severe Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) vulnerability that could be exploited by users to access the virtual disks of other Oracle customers.  "Each virtual disk in Oracle's cloud has a unique identifier called OCID," Shir Tamari, head of research at Wiz,  said  in a series of tweets. "This identifier is not considered secret, and organizations do not treat it as such."  "Given the OCID of a victim's disk that is not currently attached to an active server or configured as shareable, an attacker could 'attach' to it and obtain read/write over it," Tamari added.   The cloud security firm, which dubbed the tenant isolation vulnerability " AttachMe ," said Oracle  patched the issue  within 24 hours of responsible disclosure on June 9, 2022.  Accessing a volume using the CLI without sufficient permissions  At its core, the vulnerability is rooted in the fact that a disk could be attached to a compute

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as 350,000 open source projects are believed to be potentially vulnerable to exploitation as a result of a security flaw in a Python module that has remained unpatched for 15 years.  The open source repositories span a number of industry verticals, such as software development, artificial intelligence/machine learning, web development, media, security, IT management.  The shortcoming, tracked as  CVE-2007-4559  (CVSS score: 6.8), is rooted in the tarfile module, successful exploitation of which could lead to code execution from an arbitrary file write.   "The vulnerability is a path traversal attack in the extract and extractall functions in the tarfile module that allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files by adding the '..' sequence to filenames in a TAR archive," Trellix security researcher Kasimir Schulz  said  in a writeup.  Originally disclosed in August 2007, the bug has to do with how a specially crafted tar archive can be leveraged to overwrite a

Hackers Targeting Unpatched Atlassian Confluence Servers to Deploy Crypto Miners<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/hackers-targeting-unpatched-atlassian.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-patched critical security flaw affecting Atlassian Confluence Server that came to light a few months ago is being actively exploited for illicit cryptocurrency mining on unpatched installations.  "If left unremedied and successfully exploited, this vulnerability could be used for multiple and more malicious attacks, such as a complete domain takeover of the infrastructure and the deployment information stealers, remote access trojans (RATs), and ransomware," Trend Micro threat researcher Sunil Bharti  said  in a report.  The issue, tracked as  CVE-2022-26134  (CVSS score: 9.8), was addressed by the Australian software company in June 2022.   In one of the infection chains observed by the cybersecurity company, the flaw was leveraged to download and run a shell script ("ro.sh") on the victim's machine, which, in turn, fetched a second shell script ("ap.sh").  The malicious code is designed to update the  PATH variable  to include additional paths

An unknown attacker targeted tens of thousands of unauthenticated Redis servers exposed on the internet in an attempt to  install a cryptocurrency miner .  It's not immediately known if all of these hosts were successfully compromised. Nonetheless, it was made possible by means of a "lesser-known technique" designed to trick the servers into writing data to arbitrary files – a case of  unauthorized access  that was first documented in September 2018.  "The general idea behind this exploitation technique is to configure Redis to write its file-based database to a directory containing some method to authorize a user (like adding a key to '.ssh/authorized_keys'), or start a process (like adding a script to '/etc/cron.d')," Censys  said  in a new write-up.

In what's the latest crypto heist to target the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, hackers have stolen digital assets worth around $160 million from crypto trading firm Wintermute .  The hack involved a series of unauthorized transactions that transferred USD Coin, Binance USD, Tether USD, Wrapped ETH, and 66 other cryptocurrencies to the  attacker's wallet .  The company said that its centralized finance (CeFi) and over-the-counter (OTC) operations have not been impacted by the security incident. It did not disclose when the hack took place.   The digital asset market maker, which provides liquidity to more several exchanges and crypto platforms, warned of disruption to its services in the coming days, but stressed that it's "solvent with twice over that amount in equity left."  "We are (still) open to treat[ing] this as a white hat, so if you are the attacker – get in touch," the company's founder and CEO, Evgeny Gaevoy,  said  in a tweet.  Detai

For cybersecurity professionals, it is a huge challenge to separate the "good guys" from the "villains". In the past, most cyberattacks could simply be traced to external cybercriminals, cyberterrorists, or rogue nation-states.  But not anymore .  Threats from within organizations – also known as "insider threats" – are increasing and cybersecurity practitioners are feeling the pain.   Traditional perimeter defenses are not designed to prevent these attacks. They also struggle to keep  external  attackers out. Clever hackers continuously find ways in and "weaponize" their trusted status inside the network to compromise sensitive assets and orchestrate larger attacks.  And an increasing number of enterprise resources – applications, devices, data, and even people – now live outside the perimeter. It's difficult to protect these assets with legacy approaches, much less fortify the perimeter to keep attackers out completely.  How can you protect your organization in this landscape?  The

The agency  said  the companies are subject to the Chinese government's exploitation, influence, and control, and could be forced to comply with requests for intercepting and misrouting communications, without the ability to challenge such requests.   The Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau further noted that equipment and services from ComNet and China Unicom could present an opportunity for the Chinese government to carry out espionage operations and gather intelligence against the U.S.  Alternatively, they could also provide the Chinese government with a strategic capability to "target, collect, alter, block, and reroute network traffic."

Cybersecurity company Imperva has disclosed that it mitigated a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack with a total of over 25.3 billion requests on June 27, 2022.  The "strong attack," which targeted an unnamed Chinese telecommunications company, is said to have lasted for four hours and peaked at 3.9 million requests per second (RPS).  "Attackers used HTTP/2 multiplexing, or combining multiple packets into one, to send multiple requests at once over individual connections," Imperva  said  in a report published on September 19.  The attack was launched from a botnet that comprised nearly 170,000 different IP addresses spanning routers, security cameras, and compromised servers located in more than 180 countries, primarily the U.S., Indonesia, and Brazil.   The disclosure also comes as web infrastructure provider Akamai said it fielded a new DDoS assault aimed at a customer based in Eastern Europe on September 12, with attack traffic spiking at 704.8 million p

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday released an industrial control systems (ICS) advisory warning of seven security flaws in Dataprobe's iBoot-PDU power distribution unit product, mostly used in industrial environments and data centers.  "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution on the Dataprobe iBoot-PDU device," the agency  said  in a notice.  Credited with disclosing the flaws is industrial cybersecurity firm Claroty, which  said  the weaknesses could be remotely triggered "either through a direct web connection to the device or via the cloud."   iBoot-PDU  is a power distribution unit (PDU) that provides users with real-time monitoring capabilities and sophisticated alerting mechanisms via a web interface so as to control the power supply to devices and other equipment in an OT environment.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Almost every vendor, from email gateway companies to developers of threat intelligence platforms, is positioning themselves as an XDR player. But unfortunately, the noise around XDR makes it harder for buyers to find solutions that might be right for them or, more importantly, avoid ones that don't meet their needs.   Stellar Cyber delivers an Open XDR solution that allows organizations to use whatever security tools they desire in their security stack, feeding alerts and logs into Stellar Cyber. Stellar Cyber's "Open" approach means their platform can work with any product. As a result, a security team can make changes without wondering if the Stellar Cyber Open XDR platform will still work.   Stellar Cyber address the needs of lean enterprise security teams by providing capabilities typically found in NG-SIEM, NDR, and SOAR products in their Open XDR platform, managed by a single license. This consolidation enables customers to eliminate security stack complexity.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat cluster linked to the Russian nation-state actor tracked as Sandworm has continued its targeting of Ukraine with commodity malware by masquerading as telecom providers, new findings show.  Recorded Future said it discovered new infrastructure belonging to UAC-0113 that mimics operators like Datagroup and EuroTransTelecom to deliver payloads such as  Colibri loader  and  Warzone RAT .  The attacks are said to be an expansion of the  same campaign  that previously distributed  DCRat  (or DarkCrystal RAT) using phishing emails with legal aid-themed lures against providers of telecommunications in Ukraine.   Sandworm is a  destructive Russian threat group  that's best known for carrying out attacks such as the 2015 and 2016 targeting of Ukrainian electrical grid and 2017's NotPetya attacks. It's confirmed to be Unit 74455 of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency.  The adversarial collective, also known as Voodoo Bear, sought to damage high-voltage electrical s

Uber on Monday disclosed more details related to the  security incident  that happened last week, pinning the attack on a threat actor it believes is affiliated to the notorious LAPSUS$ hacking group.  "This group typically uses similar techniques to target technology companies, and in 2022 alone has breached Microsoft, Cisco, Samsung, NVIDIA, and Okta, among others," the San Francisco-based company  said  in an update.  The financially-motivated extortionist gang was dealt a huge blow in March 2022 when the City of London Police  moved to arrest  seven suspected LAPSUS$ gang members aged between 16 and 21. Weeks later, two of them were charged for their actions.  The hacker behind the Uber breach, an 18-year-old teenager who goes by the moniker Tea Pot, has also claimed responsibility for breaking into video game maker  Rockstar Games  over the weekend.   Uber said it's working with "several leading digital forensics firms" as the company's investigation i

The trove of data, contains some 90 videos of clips from the game, leaked over the weekend on  GTAForums  by a user with an alias "teapotuberhacker," hinting that the party is also the same person responsible for the  recent Uber breach .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Emotet malware is now being leveraged by ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups, including Quantum and BlackCat, after  Conti's official retirement  from the threat landscape this year.  Emotet  started off as a banking trojan in 2014, but updates added to it over time have transformed the malware into a highly potent threat that's capable of downloading other payloads onto the victim's machine, which would allow the attacker to control it remotely.  Although the infrastructure associated with the invasive malware loader was taken down as part of a law enforcement effort in January 2021, the Conti ransomware cartel is said to have  played an instrumental role  in its comeback late last year.   "From November 2021 to Conti's dissolution in June 2022, Emotet was an exclusive Conti ransomware tool, however, the Emotet infection chain is currently attributed to Quantum and BlackCat," AdvIntel  said  in an advisory published last week.

Organizations and security teams work to protect themselves from any vulnerability, and often don't realize that risk is also brought on by configurations in their SaaS apps that have not been hardened. The newly published GIFShell attack method, which occurs through Microsoft Teams, is a perfect example of how threat actors can exploit legitimate features and configurations that haven't been correctly set. This article takes a look at what the method entails and the steps needed to combat it.   The GifShell Attack Method  Discovered by Bobby Rauch , the GIFShell attack technique enables bad actors to exploit several Microsoft Teams features to act as a C&C for malware, and exfiltrate data using GIFs without being detected by EDR and other network monitoring tools.

A decryptor for the LockerGoga ransomware has been  made available  by Romanian cybersecurity firm Bitdefender in collaboration with Europol, the No More Ransom project, and Zürich law enforcement authorities.  Identified in January 2019, LockerGoga drew headlines for its attacks against the Norwegian aluminum giant  Norsk Hydro . It's said to have infected more than 1,800 victims in 71 countries, causing an estimated $104 million in damages.   The ransomware operation received a significant blow in October 2021 when 12 people in connection with the group, alongside MegaCortex and Dharma, were apprehended as part of an  international law enforcement effort .   The arrests, which took place in Ukraine and Switzerland, also saw the seizure of cash worth $52,000, five luxury vehicles, and a number of electronic devices. One of the accused is currently in pretrial detention in Zurich.  The Zurich Cantonal Police further said it spent the past months examining the data storage devices

Microsoft said it's tracking an ongoing large-scale click fraud campaign targeting gamers by means of stealthily deployed browser extensions on compromised systems.  "[The] attackers monetize clicks generated by a browser node-webkit or malicious browser extension secretly installed on devices," Microsoft Security Intelligence said  in a sequence of tweets over the weekend.  The tech giant's cybersecurity division is tracking the developing threat cluster under the name DEV-0796.   Attach chains mounted by the adversary commence with an ISO file that's downloaded onto a victim's machine upon clicking on a malicious ad or comments on YouTube. The ISO file, when opened, is designed to install a browser node-webkit (aka  NW.js ) or rogue browser extension.   It's worth noting that the  ISO file  masquerades as hacks and cheats for the Krunker first-person shooter game. Cheats are programs that help gamers gain an added advantage beyond the available capabili

The ride-hailing company also said it's brought back online all the internal software tools it took down previously as a precaution, reiterating it's notified law enforcement of the matter.  It's not immediately clear if the incident resulted in the theft of any other information or how long the intruder was inside Uber's network.

Password management solution LastPass shared more details pertaining to the security incident last month, disclosing that the threat actor had access to its systems for a four-day period in August 2022.  "There is no evidence of any threat actor activity beyond the established timeline," LastPass CEO Karim Toubba  said  in an update shared on September 15, adding, "there is no evidence that this incident involved any access to customer data or encrypted password vaults."  LastPass in late August  revealed  that a breach targeting its development environment resulted in the theft of some of its source code and technical information, although no further specifics were offered.   The company, which said it completed the probe into the hack in partnership with incident response firm Mandiant, said the access was achieved using a developer's compromised endpoint.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have exposed new connections between a widely used pay-per-install (PPI) malware service known as PrivateLoader and another PPI platform offered by a cybercriminal actor dubbed ruzki.  "The threat actor ruzki (aka les0k, zhigalsz) advertises their PPI service on underground Russian-speaking forums and their Telegram channels under the name ruzki or zhigalsz since at least May 2021," SEKOIA  said.  The cybersecurity firm said its investigations into the twin services led it to conclude that PrivateLoader is the proprietary loader of the ruzki PPI malware service.  PrivateLoader, as the name implies, functions as a C++-based loader to download and deploy additional malicious payloads on infected Windows hosts. It's primarily distributed through SEO-optimized websites that claim to provide cracked software.  Although it was  first documented  earlier this February by Intel471, it's said to have been put to use starting as early as May 2021.   S

North Korean Hackers Spreading Trojanized Versions of PuTTY Client Application<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/north-korean-hackers-spreading.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat with a North Korea nexus has been found leveraging a "novel spear phish methodology" that involves making use of trojanized versions of the PuTTY SSH and Telnet client.  Google-owned threat intelligence firm Mandiant attributed the new campaign to an emerging threat cluster it tracks under the name  UNC4034 .  "UNC4034 established communication with the victim over WhatsApp and lured them to download a malicious ISO package regarding a fake job offering that led to the deployment of the AIRDRY.V2 backdoor through a trojanized instance of the PuTTY utility," Mandiant researchers  said .   The utilization of fabricated job lures as a pathway for malware distribution is an oft-used tactic by North Korean state-sponsored actors, including the Lazarus Group, as part of an enduring campaign called  Operation Dream Job .  The entry point of the attack is an ISO file that masquerades as an Amazon Assessment as part of a potential job opportunity at the tech giant.

Malicious actors such as Kinsing are taking advantage of both recently disclosed and older security flaws in Oracle WebLogic Server to deliver cryptocurrency-mining malware.  Cybersecurity company Trend Micro said it  found  the financially-motivated group leveraging the vulnerability to drop Python scripts with capabilities to disable operating system (OS) security features such as Security-Enhanced Linux ( SELinux ), and others.  The operators behind the  Kinsing malware  have a history of scanning for vulnerable servers to co-opt them into a botnet, including that of  Redis ,  SaltStack ,  Log4Shell ,  Spring4Shell , and the Atlassian Confluence flaw ( CVE-2022-26134 ).   The Kinsing actors have also been involved in campaigns against container environments via  misconfigured open Docker Daemon API ports  to launch a crypto miner and subsequently spread the malware to other containers and hosts.
