The threat actor behind the Fodcha distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet has resurfaced with new capabilities, researchers reveal.  This includes changes to its communication protocol and the ability to extort cryptocurrency payments in exchange for stopping the DDoS attack against a target, Qihoo 360's Network Security Research Lab  said  in a report published last week.  Fodcha  first came to light  earlier this April, with the malware propagating through known vulnerabilities in Android and IoT devices as well as weak Telnet or SSH passwords.   The cybersecurity company said that Fodcha has evolved into a large-scale botnet with over 60,000 active nodes and 40 command-and-control (C2) domains that can "easily generate more than 1 Tbps traffic."  Peak activity is said to have occurred on October 11, 2022, when the malware targeted 1,396 devices in a single day.  The top countries singled out by the botnet since late June 2022 comprises China, the U.S., Singapore,

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In today's world of automated hacking systems, frequent data breaches and consumer protection regulations such as GDPR and PCI DSS, penetration testing is now an essential security requirement for organisations of all sizes. But what should you look for when choosing the right provider?  The sheer number of providers can be daunting, and finding one which can deliver a high-quality test at a reasonable price is not easy. How do you know if they're any good? What level of security expertise was included in the report? Is your application secure, or did the supplier simply not find the weaknesses?  There are no easy answers, but you can make it easier by asking the right questions up front. The most important considerations fall into three categories: certifications, experience, and price.  Certifications  Certifications are the best place to start, as they provide a quick shortcut for building trust. There's no shortage of professional certifications available, but one of t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unofficial patch has been made available for an actively exploited security flaw in Microsoft Windows that makes it possible for files signed with malformed signatures to sneak past Mark-of-the-Web ( MotW ) protections.  The fix,  released  by 0patch, arrives weeks after HP Wolf Security  disclosed  a Magniber ransomware campaign that targets users with fake security updates which employ a JavaScript file to proliferate the file-encrypting malware.   While files downloaded from the internet in Windows are tagged with a MotW flag to prevent unauthorized actions, it has since been found that corrupt Authenticode signatures can be used to allow the execution of arbitrary executables without any  SmartScreen warning .  Authenticode  is a Microsoft code-signing technology that authenticates the identity of the publisher of a particular piece of software and verifies whether the software was tampered with after it was signed and published.

Samsung Galaxy Store Bug Could've Let Hackers Secretly Install Apps on Targeted Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/samsung-galaxy-store-bug-couldve-let.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-patched security flaw has been disclosed in the Galaxy Store app for Samsung devices that could potentially trigger remote command execution on affected phones.  The vulnerability, which affects Galaxy Store version 4.5.32.4, relates to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug that occurs when handling certain  deep links . An independent security researcher has been credited with reporting the issue.  "Here, by not checking the deep link securely, when a user accesses a link from a website containing the deeplink, the attacker can execute JS code in the webview context of the Galaxy Store application," SSD Secure Disclosure  said  in an advisory posted last week.   XSS attacks  allow an adversary to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code when visiting a website from a browser or another application.   The issue identified in the Galaxy Store app has to do with how deep links are configured for Samsung's Marketing & Content Service ( MCS ), potentially leading to

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud-based repository hosting service GitHub has addressed a high-severity security flaw that could have been exploited to create malicious repositories and mount supply chain attacks.  The RepoJacking  technique,  disclosed  by Checkmarx, entails a bypass of a protection mechanism called  popular repository namespace retirement , which aims to prevent developers from pulling unsafe repositories with the same name.  The issue was addressed by the Microsoft-owned subsidiary on September 19, 2022 following responsible disclosure.   RepoJacking  occurs  when a creator of a repository opts to change the username, potentially enabling a threat actor to claim the old username and publish a rogue repository with the same name in an attempt to trick users into downloading them.   While Microsoft's countermeasure "retire[s] the namespace of any open source project that had more than 100 clones in the week leading up to the owner's account being renamed or deleted," Checkmarx

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Communication services provider Twilio this week disclosed that it experienced another "brief security incident" in June 2022 perpetrated by the same threat actor behind the  August hack  that resulted in unauthorized access of customer information.  The security event occurred on June 29, 2022, the company said in an updated advisory shared this week, as part of its probe into the digital break-in.  "In the June incident, a Twilio employee was socially engineered through voice phishing (or 'vishing') to provide their credentials, and the malicious actor was able to access customer contact information for a limited number of customers," Twilio  said .   It further said the access gained following the successful attack was identified and thwarted within 12 hours, and that it had alerted impacted customers on July 2, 2022.  The San Francisco-based firm did not reveal the exact number of customers impacted by the June incident, and why the disclosure was made

Multiple high-severity security flaws have been disclosed as affecting Juniper Networks devices, some of which could be exploited to achieve code execution.  Chief among them is a remote pre-authenticated PHP archive file deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2022-22241, CVSS score: 8.1) in the J-Web component of Junos OS, according to Octagon Networks researcher Paulos Yibelo.  "This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker to get remote phar files deserialized, leading to arbitrary file write, which leads to a remote code execution (RCE)," Yibelo  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.   Also identified are five other issues, which are listed as follow -   CVE-2022-22242  (CVSS score: 6.1) - A pre-authenticated reflected  XSS  on the error page ("error.php"), allowing a remote adversary to siphon Junos OS admin session and chained with other flaws that require authentication.

Five malicious dropper Android apps with over 130,000 cumulative installations have been discovered on the Google Play Store distributing banking trojans like  SharkBot  and  Vultur , which are capable of stealing financial data and performing on-device fraud.  "These droppers continue the unstopping evolution of malicious apps sneaking to the official store," Dutch mobile security firm ThreatFabric told The Hacker News in a statement.  "This evolution includes following newly introduced policies and masquerading as file managers and overcoming limitations by side-loading the malicious payload through the web browser."  Targets of these  droppers  include 231 banking and cryptocurrency wallet apps from financial institutions in Italy, the U.K., Germany, Spain, Poland, Austria, the U.S., Australia, France, and the Netherlands.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud computing was the lifeline that kept many companies running during the pandemic. But it was a classic case of medicine that comes with  serious  side effects.   Having anywhere, anytime access to data and apps gives companies tremendous flexibility in a fast-changing world, plus the means to scale and customize IT at will. The cloud is an asset or upgrade in almost every way.  With one glaring exception: cybersecurity.   The cloud promised to make companies more secure and security more straightforward. Yet over the same time period that the cloud took over computing, cyber attacks grew steadily worse while security teams felt increasingly overwhelmed.   Why?   We will explain shortly. For lean security teams, the more important question is how to make cloud security work, especially as the cloud footprint grows (a lot) faster than security resources. Will the cloud always cast a shadow on cybersecurity?  Not with the strategy outlined in a free ebook from Cynet called " Th

A recently discovered hacking group known for targeting employees dealing with corporate transactions has been linked to a new backdoor called Danfuan .  This hitherto undocumented malware is delivered via another dropper called Geppei, researchers from Symantec, by Broadcom Software,  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The dropper "is being used to install a new backdoor and other tools using the novel technique of reading commands from seemingly innocuous Internet Information Services ( IIS ) logs," the researchers said.   The toolset has been attributed by the cybersecurity company to a suspected espionage actor called UNC3524, aka Cranefly, which  first came to light  in May 2022 for its focus on bulk email collection from victims who deal with mergers and acquisitions and other financial transactions.  One of the group's key malware strains is QUIETEXIT, a backdoor deployed on network appliances that do not support antivirus or endpoint detection, such

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The increased use of information technology in our everyday life and business has led to cyber-attacks becoming more sophisticated and large-scale. For organizations to thrive in this era of technology, they must develop robust security strategies to detect and mitigate attacks. Defense in depth is a strategy in which companies use multiple layers of security measures to safeguard assets. A well-implemented defense in depth can help organizations prevent and mitigate ongoing attacks.   Defense in depth uses various cutting-edge security tools to safeguard a business's endpoints, data, applications, and networks. The objective is to prevent cyber threats, but a robust defense-in-depth approach also thwarts ongoing attacks and prevents further damage.  How organizations can implement defense in depth  The image above shows the various layers of security that organizations must implement. Below we describe ideas that companies should consider for each layer.  Governance and risk mana

The Raspberry Robin  worm is becoming an access-as-a-service malware for deploying other payloads, including  IcedID ,  Bumblebee ,  TrueBot  (aka Silence), and  Clop ransomware .  It is "part of a complex and interconnected malware ecosystem, with links to other malware families and alternate infection methods beyond its original USB drive spread," the Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)  said  in a detailed write-up.  Raspberry Robin , also called QNAP Worm owing to the use of compromised QNAP storage servers for command-and-control, is the name given to a malware by cybersecurity company Red Canary that spreads to Windows systems through infected USB drives.  MSTIC is keeping tabs on the activity group behind the USB-based Raspberry Robin infections as  DEV-0856 , adding it's aware of at least four confirmed entry points that all have the likely end goal of deploying ransomware.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A 34-year-old U.K. national has been arraigned in the U.S. for operating a dark web marketplace called  The Real Deal  that specialized in the sales of hacking tools and stolen login credentials.  Daniel Kaye , who went by a litany of pseudonyms Popopret, Bestbuy, UserL0ser, and Spdrman, has been charged with five counts of access device fraud and one count of money laundering conspiracy.  Kaye was indicted in April 2021, and subsequently consented to his extradition from Cyprus to the U.S. in September 2022.   "While living overseas, this defendant allegedly operated an illegal website that made hacking tools and login credentials available for purchase, including those for U.S. government agencies,"  said  U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan.  Court documents show that  The Real Deal , until its shutdown in 2016, functioned as a market for illicit items, including stolen account logins for U.S. government computers, bank accounts, and social media platforms such as Twitter and

As many as 85 command-and-control (C2) servers have been  discovered  supported by the ShadowPad malware since September 2021, with infrastructure detected as recently as October 16, 2022.  That's according to VMware's Threat Analysis Unit (TAU), which  studied  three ShadowPad variants using TCP, UDP, and HTTP(S) protocols for C2 communications.  ShadowPad , seen as a successor to  PlugX , is a modular malware platform privately shared among multiple Chinese state-sponsored actors since 2015.   Taiwanese cybersecurity firm TeamT5, earlier this May, disclosed details of another China-nexus modular implant named  Pangolin8RAT , which is believed to be the successor of the PlugX and ShadowPad malware families, linking it to a threat group dubbed Tianwu.   An analysis of the three ShadowPad artifacts, which have been previously put to use by  Winnti ,  Tonto Team , and an emerging threat cluster codenamed  Space Pirates , made it possible to discover the C2 servers by scanning th

Automobile, Energy, Media, Ransomware? When thinking about verticals, one may not instantly think of cyber-criminality. Yet, every move made by governments, clients, and private contractors screams toward normalizing those  menaces  as a new vertical.  Ransomware has every trait of the classical economical vertical. A thriving ecosystem of insurers, negotiators, software providers, and managed service experts.  This cybercrime branch looks at a loot stash that counts for trillions of dollars. The cybersecurity industry is too happy to provide services, software, and insurance to accommodate this new normal.   Intense insurer lobbying in France led the finance ministry to give a positive opinion about reimbursing ransoms, against the very advice of its government's cybersecurity branch. The market is so big and juicy that no one can get in the way of "the development of the cyber insurance market."  In the US, Colonial pipeline is seeking tax reductions from the loss incu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-patched security flaw in Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems could have potentially enabled apps with Bluetooth access to eavesdrop on conversations with Siri.  Apple said "an app may be able to record audio using a pair of connected AirPods," adding it addressed the Core Bluetooth issue in iOS 16.1 with improved entitlements.  Credited with discovering and reporting the bug in August 2022 is app developer Guilherme Rambo. The bug, dubbed  SiriSpy , has been assigned the identifier CVE-2022-32946.  "Any app with access to Bluetooth could record your conversations with Siri and audio from the iOS keyboard dictation feature when using AirPods or Beats headsets," Rambo  said  in a write-up.   "This would happen without the app requesting microphone access permission and without the app leaving any trace that it was listening to the microphone."  The vulnerability, according to Rambo, relates to a service called DoAP that's included in AirPo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new cryptojacking campaign has been uncovered targeting vulnerable Docker and Kubernetes infrastructures as part of opportunistic attacks designed to illicitly mine cryptocurrency.  Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike dubbed the activity  Kiss-a-dog , with its command-and-control infrastructure overlapping with those associated with other groups like  TeamTNT , which are known to  strike   misconfigured  Docker and Kubernetes instances.  The intrusions, spotted in September 2022, get their name from a domain named "kiss.a-dog[.]top" that's used to trigger a shell script payload on the compromised container using a Base64-encoded Python command.   "The URL used in the payload is obscured with backslashes to defeat automated decoding and regex matching to retrieve the malicious domain," CrowdStrike researcher Manoj Ahuje  said  in a technical analysis.  The attack chain subsequently attempts to escape the container and move laterally into the breached network, wh

A 26-year-old Ukrainian national has been charged in the U.S. for his alleged role in the  Raccoon Stealer  malware-as-a-service (MaaS) operation.  Mark Sokolovsky, who was arrested by Dutch law enforcement after leaving Ukraine on March 4, 2022, in what's said to be a Porsche Cayenne, is currently being held in the Netherlands and awaits extradition to the U.S.  "Individuals who deployed Raccoon Infostealer to steal data from victims leased access to the malware for approximately $200 per month, paid for by cryptocurrency," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)  said . "These individuals used various ruses, such as email phishing, to install the malware onto the computers of unsuspecting victims."   Sokolovsky is said to have gone by various online monikers like Photix, raccoonstealer, and black21jack77777 on online cybercrime forums to advertise the service for sale.

The threat actor behind a remote access trojan called RomCom RAT has been observed targeting Ukrainian military institutions as part of a new spear-phishing campaign that commenced on October 21, 2022.   The development marks a shift in the attacker's modus operandi, which has been previously attributed to spoofing legitimate apps like Advanced IP Scanner and pdfFiller to drop backdoors on compromised systems.  "The initial 'Advanced IP Scanner' campaign occurred on July 23, 2022," the BlackBerry research and intelligence team  said . "Once the victim installs a Trojanized bundle, it drops RomCom RAT to the system."   While previous iterations of the campaign involved the use of trojanized Advanced IP Scanner, the unidentified adversarial collective has since switched to pdfFiller as of October 20, indicating an active attempt on part of the adversary to refine tactics and thwart detection.  These lookalike websites host a rogue installer package that r

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A cybercrime group known as  Vice Society  has been linked to multiple ransomware strains in its malicious campaigns aimed at the education, government, and retail sectors.  The Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence team, which is tracking the threat cluster under the moniker DEV-0832, said the group avoids deploying ransomware in some cases and rather likely carries out extortion using exfiltrated stolen data.  "Shifting ransomware payloads over time from  BlackCat ,  Quantum Locker , and  Zeppelin , DEV-0832's latest payload is a Zeppelin variant that includes Vice Society-specific file extensions, such as .v-s0ciety, .v-society, and, most recently, .locked," the tech giant's cybersecurity division  said .   Vice Society, active since June 2021, has been steadily observed encrypting and exfiltrating victim data, and threatening companies with exposure of siphoned information to pressure them into paying a ransom.

Cisco has warned of active exploitation attempts targeting a pair of two-year-old security flaws in the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows.  Tracked as  CVE-2020-3153  (CVSS score: 6.5) and  CVE-2020-3433  (CVSS score: 7.8), the vulnerabilities could enable local authenticated attackers to perform DLL hijacking and copy arbitrary files to system directories with elevated privileges.   While CVE-2020-3153 was addressed by Cisco in February 2020, a fix for CVE-2020-3433 was shipped in August 2020.   "In October 2022, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team became aware of additional attempted exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild," the networking equipment maker said in an updated advisory.  "Cisco continues to strongly recommend that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this vulnerability."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware on Tuesday shipped security updates to address a critical security flaw in its VMware Cloud Foundation product.  Tracked as CVE-2021-39144, the issue has been rated 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system, and relates to a remote code execution vulnerability via XStream open source library.  "Due to an unauthenticated endpoint that leverages XStream for input serialization in VMware Cloud Foundation (NSX-V), a malicious actor can get remote code execution in the context of 'root' on the appliance," the company  said  in an advisory.   In light of the severity of the flaw and its relatively low bar for exploitation, the Palo Alto-based virtualization services provider has also made available a  patch  for end-of-life products.  Also addressed by VMware as part of the update is CVE-2022-31678 (CVSS score: 5.3), an XML External Entity ( XXE ) vulnerability that could be exploited to result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or unauthorized info

A high-severity vulnerability has been disclosed in the SQLite database library, which was introduced as part of a code change dating all the way back to October 2000 and could enable attackers to crash or control programs.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-35737  (CVSS score: 7.5), the 22-year-old issue affects SQLite versions  1.0.12  through 3.39.1, and has been addressed in  version 3.39.2  released on July 21, 2022.   "CVE-2022-35737 is  exploitable  on 64-bit systems, and exploitability depends on how the program is compiled," Trail of Bits researcher Andreas Kellas  said  in a technical write-up published today.  "Arbitrary code execution is confirmed when the library is compiled without stack canaries, but unconfirmed when stack canaries are present, and denial-of-service is confirmed in all cases."   Programmed in C, SQLite  is the most widely used  database engine , included by default in Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS, as well as popular web browsers such as Googl

The  Hive  ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group has claimed responsibility for a cyber attack against Tata Power that was disclosed by the company less than two weeks ago.  The incident is said to have occurred on October 3, 2022. The threat actor has also been observed leaking stolen data exfiltrated prior to encrypting the network as part of its double extortion scheme.

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details about a pair of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, one of which could be exploited to result in a denial-of-service (DoS).  The exploits, dubbed  LogCrusher  and  OverLog  by Varonis, take aim at the EventLog Remoting Protocol ( MS-EVEN ), which enables remote access to event logs.   While the former allows "any domain user to remotely crash the Event Log application of any Windows machine," OverLog causes a DoS by "filling the hard drive space of any Windows machine on the domain," Dolev Taler  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  OverLog has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-37981 (CVSS score: 4.3) and was addressed by Microsoft as part of its  October Patch Tuesday  updates. LogCrusher, however, remains unresolved.

How the Software Supply Chain Security is Threatened by Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/how-software-supply-chain-security-is.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Introduction  In many ways, the software supply chain is similar to that of manufactured goods, which we all know has been largely impacted by a global pandemic and shortages of raw materials.   However, in the IT world, it is not shortages or pandemics that have been the main obstacles to overcome in recent years, but rather attacks aimed at using them to harm hundreds or even thousands of victims simultaneously. If you've heard of a cyber attack between 2020 and today, it's likely that the software supply chain played a role.   When we talk about an attack on the software supply chain, we are actually referring to two successive attacks: one that targets a supplier, and one that targets one or more downstream users in the chain, using the first as a vehicle.  In this article, we will dive into the mechanisms and risks of the software supply chain by looking at a typical vulnerability of the modern development cycle: the presence of personal identifying information, or "

Cybercriminals Used Two PoS Malware to Steal Details of Over 167,000 Credit Cards<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/cybercriminals-used-two-pos-malware-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two point-of-sale (PoS) malware variants have been put to use by a threat actor to steal information related to more than 167,000 credit cards from payment terminals.  According to Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity company Group-IB, the stolen data dumps could net the operators as much as $3.34 million by selling them on underground forums.  While a significant proportion of attacks aimed at gathering payment data rely on  JavaScript sniffers  (aka web skimmers) stealthily inserted on e-commerce websites, PoS malware continues to be an ongoing, if less popular, threat.  Just last month, Kaspersky detailed new tactics adopted by a Brazilian threat actor known as  Prilex  to steal money by means of fraudulent transactions.   "Almost all PoS malware strains have a similar card dump extraction functionality, but different methods for maintaining persistence on infected devices, data exfiltration and processing," researchers Nikolay Shelekhov and Said Khamchiev  said .

Apple Releases Patch for New Actively Exploited iOS and iPadOS Zero-Day Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/apple-releases-patch-for-new-actively.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Tech giant Apple on Monday rolled out updates to remediate a zero-day flaw in iOS and iPadOS that it said has been actively exploited in the wild.  The weakness, given the identifier CVE-2022-42827 , has been described as an out-of-bounds write issue in the Kernel, which could be abused by a rogue application to execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges.  Successful exploitation of out-of-bounds write  flaws, which typically occur when a program attempts to write data to a memory location that's outside of the bounds of what it is allowed to access, can result in corruption of data, a crash, or execution of unauthorized code.  The iPhone maker said it addressed the bug with improved bounds checking, while crediting an anonymous researcher for reporting the vulnerability.  As is usually the case with actively exploited zero-day flaws, Apple refrained from sharing more specifics about the shortcoming other than acknowledging that it's "aware of a report that this i

The threat group, also called APT-C-17, Rattlesnake, and Razor Tiger, is  suspected  to be an Indian state-sponsored group, although a report from Kaspersky earlier this May acknowledged previous indicators that led to the attribution have since disappeared, making it challenging it to link the threat cluster to a specific nation.

The breach of LA Unified School District (LAUSD) highlights the prevalence of password vulnerabilities, as criminal hackers continue to use breached credentials in increasingly frequent ransomware attacks on education.

Researchers have disclosed details about a now-patched critical flaw in the Move virtual machine that powers the Aptos blockchain network.  The vulnerability "can cause Aptos nodes to crash and cause denial of service," Singapore-based Numen Cyber Labs  said  in a technical write-up published earlier this month.  Aptos is a  new entrant  to the blockchain space, which  launched  its  mainnet  on October 17, 2022. It has its roots in the Diem stablecoin payment system proposed by Meta (née Facebook), which also introduced a short-lived digital wallet called  Novi .   The network is built using a platform-agnostic programming language known as  Move , a Rust-based system that's  designed  to implement and execute  smart contracts  in a secure  runtime environment , also known as the Move Virtual Machine (aka  MoveVM ).   The  vulnerability  identified by Numen Cyber Labs is rooted in the Move language's verification module (" stack_usage_verifier.rs "), a com

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious  Emotet botnet  has been linked to a new wave of malspam campaigns that take advantage of password-protected archive files to drop CoinMiner and Quasar RAT on compromised systems.  In an  attack chain  detected by Trustwave SpiderLabs researchers, an invoice-themed ZIP file lure was found to contain a nested self-extracting (SFX) archive, the first archive acting as a conduit to launch the second.  While phishing attacks like these traditionally require persuading the target into opening the attachment, the cybersecurity company said the campaign sidesteps this hurdle by making use of a batch file to automatically supply the password to unlock the payload.   The first SFX archive file further makes use of either a PDF or Excel icon to make it appear legitimate, when, in reality, it contains three components: the password-protected second SFX RAR file, the aforementioned batch script which launches the archive, and a decoy PDF or image.  "The execution of the batch f

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-patched vulnerability in VMware Workspace ONE Access has been observed being exploited to deliver both cryptocurrency miners and ransomware on affected machines.  "The attacker intends to utilize a victim's resources as much as possible, not only to install RAR1Ransom for extortion, but also to spread GuardMiner to collect cryptocurrency," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin  said  in a Thursday report.   The issue, tracked as CVE-2022-22954  (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a remote code execution vulnerability that stems from a case of server-side template injection. Although the shortcoming was addressed by the virtualization services provider in April 2022, it has since come under  active  exploitation  in the wild.   Fortinet said it observed in August 2022 attacks that sought to weaponize the flaw to deploy the  Mirai botnet  on Linux devices as well as the RAR1Ransom and  GuardMiner , a variant of the XMRig Monero miner.  The Mirai sample is retrieved fr

WordPress security company Wordfence on Thursday said it started detecting exploitation attempts targeting the newly disclosed flaw in Apache Commons Text  on October 18, 2022.  The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2022-42889  aka  Text4Shell , has been assigned a severity ranking of 9.8 out of a possible 10.0 on the CVSS scale and affects versions 1.5 through 1.9 of the library.  It's also similar to the now infamous  Log4Shell  vulnerability in that the  issue  is rooted in the manner  string substitutions  carried out during  DNS, script, and URL lookups  could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on susceptible systems when passing untrusted input.   "The attacker can send a crafted payload remotely using 'script,' 'dns,' and 'url' lookups to achieve arbitrary remote code execution," Zscaler ThreatLabZ team explained .

The text of the announcement contains several statements that anyone who's ever read about cybersecurity will have heard many times over: increasing resilience, greater awareness, countering ransomware attacks – the list goes on.   There are some novel aspects to the text as well, including a realization that cybersecurity is not, has never been, and will never be something that can be solved at the nation-state level.   The White House also pointed to IoT warning labels as a solution – and reminded us all (and we do need reminding) about the importance of cybersecurity education. Let's take a look.  International cooperation is critical  A key point that the White House statement makes very clear is that cyberattacks are asymmetric in the

Microsoft also emphasized that the B2B leak was "caused by an unintentional misconfiguration on an endpoint that is not in use across the Microsoft ecosystem and was not the result of a security vulnerability."  The misconfiguration of the Azure Blob Storage was spotted on September 24, 2022, by cybersecurity company SOCRadar, which termed the leak  BlueBleed .

A Russian-speaking ransomware group dubbed OldGremlin has been attributed to 16 malicious campaigns aimed at entities operating in the transcontinental Eurasian nation over the course of two and a half years.  "The group's victims include companies in sectors such as logistics, industry, insurance, retail, real estate, software development, and banking," Group-IB  said  in an exhaustive report shared with The Hacker News. "In 2020, the group even targeted an arms manufacturer."  In what's a rarity in the ransomware landscape, OldGremlin (aka TinyScouts) is one of the very few financially motivated cybercrime gangs that primarily focuses on Russian companies.  Other notable groups consist of Dharma, Crylock, and Thanos, contributing to an uptick in ransomware attacks targeting businesses in the country by over 200% in 2021.

Hackers Using New Version of FurBall Android Malware to Spy on Iranian Citizens<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/hackers-using-new-version-of-furball.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian threat actor known as Domestic Kitten  has been attributed to a new mobile campaign that masquerades as a translation app to distribute an updated variant of an Android malware known as FurBall.  "Since June 2021, it has been distributed as a translation app via a copycat of an Iranian website that provides translated articles, journals, and books," ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The updates, while retaining the same surveillance functionality as earlier versions, are designed to evade detection by security solutions, the Slovak cybersecurity firm added.  Domestic Kitten, also called APT-C-50, is an Iranian threat activity cluster that has been previously identified as targeting individuals of interest with the goal of harvesting sensitive information from compromised mobile devices. It's been known to be active since at least 2016.   A tactical analysis conducted by Trend Micro in 2019 revealed Domestic Kitten

Not All Sandboxes Are for Children: How to Secure Your SaaS Sandbox<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/not-all-sandboxes-are-for-children-how.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
When creating a Sandbox, the mindset tends to be that the Sandbox is considered a place to play around, test things, and there will be no effect on the production or operational system. Therefore, people don't actively think they need to worry about its security. This mindset is not only wrong, but extremely dangerous.   When it comes to software developers, their version of sandbox is similar to a child's playground — a place to build and test without breaking any flows in production. Meanwhile, in the world of cybersecurity, the term 'sandbox' is used to describe a virtual environment or machine used to run suspicious code and other elements.   Many organizations use a Sandbox for their SaaS apps — to test changes without disrupting the production SaaS app or even to connect new apps (much like a software developer's Sandbox). This common practice often leads to a false sense of security and in turn a lack of thought for its security implications. This article wi

New Ursnif Variant Likely Shifting Focus to Ransomware and Data Theft<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/latest-ursnif-variant-shifts-focus-from.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Ursnif malware has become the latest malware to shed its roots as a banking trojan to revamp itself into a generic backdoor capable of delivering next-stage payloads, joining the likes of Emotet, Qakbot, and TrickBot.  "This is a significant shift from the malware's original purpose to enable banking fraud, but is consistent with the broader threat landscape," Mandiant researchers Sandor Nemes, Sulian Lebegue, and Jessa Valdez  disclosed  in a Wednesday analysis.   The refreshed and refactored variant, first spotted by the Google-owned threat intelligence firm in the wild on June 23, 2022, has been codenamed LDR4, in what's being seen as an attempt to lay the groundwork for potential ransomware and data theft extortion operations.  Ursnif, also called Gozi or ISFB, is one of the oldest banker malware families, with  the earliest documented attacks  going as far back as 2007.

The Federal Police of Brazil on Wednesday announced it had arrested an individual for purported links to the notorious LAPSUS$ extortionist gang.  The arrest was made as part of a new law enforcement effort, dubbed Operation Dark Cloud, that was launched in August 2022, the agency noted. Not much is known about the suspect other than the fact that the person could be a teenager.  The Polícia Federal said it commenced its investigation in December 2021 following an attack on websites under Brazil's  Ministry of Health , resulting in the alleged exfiltration of 50TB of data and  temporary unavailability  of COVID-19 vaccination data of millions of citizens.  Other federal government portals targeted by the LAPSUS$ group in Brazil include the Ministry of Economy, Comptroller General of the Union, and the Federal Highway Police.

Cybersecurity researchers have shared more details about a now-patched security flaw in Azure Service Fabric Explorer (SFX) that could potentially enable an attacker to gain administrator privileges on the cluster.  The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2022-35829 , carries a CVSS severity rating of 6.2 and was addressed by Microsoft as part of its  Patch Tuesday updates  last week.   Orca Security, which  discovered and reported  the flaw to the tech giant on August 11, 2022, dubbed the vulnerability  FabriXss  (pronounced "fabrics"). It impacts Azure Fabric Explorer version 8.1.316 and prior.  SFX is described by Microsoft as an  open-source tool  for inspecting and managing  Azure Service Fabric  clusters, a distributed systems platform that's used to build and deploy microservices-based cloud applications.   The vulnerability is rooted in the fact that a user with  permissions  to "Create Compose Application" through the SFX client can leverage the privileges

An advanced persistent threat (APT) group of Chinese origin codenamed  DiceyF  has been linked to a string of attacks aimed at online casinos in Southeast Asia for years.  Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky said the activity aligns with another set of intrusions attributed to  Earth Berberoka  (aka  GamblingPuppet ) and  DRBControl , citing tactical and targeting similarities as well as the abuse of secure messaging clients.   "Possibly we have a mix of espionage and [intellectual property] theft, but the true motivations remain a mystery," researchers Kurt Baumgartner and Georgy Kucherin  said  in a technical write-up published this week.  The starting point of the investigation was in November 2021 when Kaspersky said it detected multiple  PlugX loaders  and other payloads that were deployed via an employee monitoring service and a security package deployment service.   The initial infection method – the distribution of the framework through security solution packages

In the world of insurance providers and policies, cyber insurance is a fairly new field. And many security teams are trying to wrap their heads around it.   What is it and do they need it? And with what time will they spend researching how to integrate cyber insurance into their strategy?   For small security teams, this is particularly challenging as they contend with limited resources.  Luckily, there's a  new eBook  dedicated to helping small security teams better understand cyber insurance policies and how they may impact an organization's cybersecurity measures.  Background  In 1997, the "Internet Security Liability" (ISL) insurance policy was launched at the International Risk Insurance Management Society's convention in Honolulu. Underwritten by AIG, ISL insurance was designed to protect ecommerce retailers like Amazon that were collecting sensitive customer data and storing it on internal networks. It is credited as one of the very first cyber insurance policies to be made ava

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a previously undocumented and fully undetectable (FUD) PowerShell backdoor that gains its stealth by disguising itself as part of a Windows update process.  "The covert self-developed tool and the associated C2 commands seem to be the work of a sophisticated, unknown threat actor who has targeted approximately 100 victims," Tomer Bar, director of security research at SafeBreach,  said  in a new report.  Attributed to an  unnamed threat actor , attack chains involving the malware commence with a weaponized  Microsoft Word document  that, per the company, was uploaded from Jordan on August 25, 2022.   Metadata associated with the lure document indicates that the initial intrusion vector is a LinkedIn-based spear-phishing attack, which ultimately leads to the execution of a PowerShell script via a piece of embedded macro code.   The PowerShell script ( Script1.ps1 ) is designed to connect to a remote command-and-control (C2) server and retrieve a comm

Both cryptocurrency and ransomware are nothing new in the digital world; both have been there for a very long time, which was enough for them to find common pieces for starting their relationship.  Ransomware can be like a virtual car that works on all types of fuels, and crypto is the one that is currently most recommended. No one can argue that 2020 was the year of ransomware in the cyber world, but it wasn't due to the fact that cybercriminals chose ransomware just because they knew how to attack properly. It's because of the fact that crypto rose mostly this year, along with the new normal of the digital world. It gave them a new cause to stick to ransomware, thanks to the anonymous payments that can be made using a cryptocurrency.   How does ransomware work?   Ransomware is a malware type that encrypts the victim's files, whether it's a random user or an organization, leading to denying them access to those files on their personal devices.

The China-aligned espionage-focused actor dubbed Winnti has set its sights on government organizations in Hong Kong as part of an ongoing campaign dubbed  Operation CuckooBees .  Active since at least 2007,  Winnti  (aka APT41, Barium, Bronze Atlas, and Wicked Panda) is the name designated to a prolific cyber threat group that carries out Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity, predominantly aimed at stealing intellectual property from organizations in developed economies.  The threat actor's campaigns have targeted healthcare, telecoms, high-tech, media, agriculture, and education sectors, with infection chains primarily relying on spear-phishing emails with attachments to initially break into the victims' networks.  Earlier this May, Cybereason  disclosed  long-running attacks orchestrated by the group since 2019 to siphon technology secrets from technology and manufacturing companies mainly located in East Asia, Western Europe, and North America.

Law enforcement authorities in France, in collaboration with Spain and Latvia, have disrupted a cybercrime ring that leveraged a hacking tool to steal cars without having to use a physical key fob.  "The criminals targeted vehicles with keyless entry and start systems, exploiting the technology to get into the car and drive away," Europol  said  in a press statement.   The coordinated operation, which took place on October 10, 2022, resulted in the arrest of 31 suspects from across 22 locations in the three nations, including software developers, its resellers, and the car thieves who used the tool to break into vehicles.  Also confiscated by the officials as part of the arrests were criminal assets worth €1,098,500, not to mention an internet domain that allegedly advertised the service online.  Per Europol, the criminals are said to have singled out keyless vehicles from two unnamed French car manufacturers. The perpetrators then used the fraudulent package to replace the

HelpSystems, the company behind the Cobalt Strike software platform, has released an out-of-band security update to address a remote code execution vulnerability that could allow an attacker to take control of targeted systems.  Cobalt Strike is a commercial red-team framework that's mainly used for adversary simulation, but cracked versions of the software have been  actively   abused  by ransomware operators and espionage-focused advanced persistent threat (APT) groups alike.  The  post-exploitation tool  consists of a team server, which functions as a command-and-control (C2) component, and a beacon, the default malware used to create a connection to the team server and drop next-stage payloads.   The issue, tracked as  CVE-2022-42948 , affects Cobalt Strike version 4.7.1, and stems from an incomplete patch released on September 20, 2022, to rectify a cross-site scripting ( XSS ) vulnerability ( CVE-2022-39197 ) that could lead to remote code execution.

The development marks the first time the  nascent adversary simulation software  is being delivered via a Qakbot infection, cybersecurity firm Trend Micro  said  in a technical analysis released last week.  The intrusion, achieved using a phishing email containing a weaponized link pointing to a ZIP archive, further entailed the use of Cobalt Strike for lateral movement.  While these legitimate utilities are designed for conducting penetration testing activities, their ability to offer remote access has made them a lucrative tool in the hands of attackers looking to stealthily probe the compromised environment without attracting attention for extended periods of time.  This has been compounded by the fact that a  cracked version  of Brute Ratel C4 began circulating last month across the cybercrimi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has disclosed what's being called a security vulnerability in Microsoft 365 that could be exploited to infer message contents due to the use of a broken cryptographic algorithm.  "The [Office 365 Message Encryption] messages are encrypted in insecure Electronic Codebook ( ECB ) mode of operation," Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure  said  in a report published last week.  Office 365 Message Encryption (OME) is a security mechanism used to send and receive encrypted email messages between users inside and outside an organization without revealing anything about the communications themselves.   A consequence of the newly disclosed issue is that rogue third-parties gaining access to the encrypted email messages may be able to decipher the messages, effectively breaking confidentiality protections.  Electronic Codebook is one of the simplest modes of encryption wherein each message block is encoded separately by a key, meaning identical plaintext blocks wi

Don't let the ongoing " crypto winter " lull you into a false sense of cybersecurity. Even as  cryptocurrencies lose value  — and some crypto companies  file for bankruptcy  —  cryptojacking  still poses an urgent threat to enterprises across industries, from financial services to healthcare to industry 4.0 and beyond.   Broadly speaking, cryptojacking is defined as the unauthorized and illegitimate use of an unwitting party's compute and/or server power by a malicious actor to mine cryptocurrencies. While everyone with an internet connection is technically vulnerable to cryptojacking, most attacks target enterprises with significant compute resources, especially those with an outsized number of third-party relationships. (More on that last part in a bit.) And if a malicious actor can breach your cybersecurity defenses for cryptojacking purposes, they can breach them for any number of nefarious reasons.   Under normal conditions, mining for cryptocurrency is hugely expensive because d

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new ransomware campaign targeted the transportation and logistics sectors in Ukraine and Poland on October 11 with a previously unknown payload dubbed  Prestige .  "The activity shares victimology with recent Russian state-aligned activity, specifically on affected geographies and countries, and overlaps with previous victims of the  FoxBlade  malware (also known as HermeticWiper)," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)  said .  The tech giant remarked the intrusions occurred within an hour of each other across all victims, attributing the infections to an unnamed cluster called DEV-0960. It did not disclose the scale of the attacks, but stated it's notifying all affected customers.  The campaign is also believed to be distinct from other recent destructive attacks that have involved the use of  HermeticWiper  and  CaddyWiper , the latter of which is launched by a malware loader called  ArguePatch  (aka AprilAxe).   The method of initial access remains unkno

Zimbra Releases Patch for Actively Exploited Vulnerability in its Collaboration Suite<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/zimbra-releases-patch-for-actively.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Zimbra has  released patches  to contain an actively exploited security flaw in its enterprise collaboration suite that could be leveraged to upload arbitrary files to vulnerable instances.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-41352  (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue affects a component of the Zimbra suite called  Amavis , an open source content filter, and more specifically, the cpio utility it uses to scan and extract archives.   The flaw, in turn, is said to be rooted in another underlying vulnerability ( CVE-2015-1197 ) that was first disclosed in early 2015, which  according to Flashpoint  was rectified, only to be subsequently reverted in later Linux distributions.  "An attacker can use cpio package to gain incorrect access to any other user accounts," Zimbra said in an advisory published last week, adding it "recommends pax over cpio."  Fixes are available in the following versions -   Zimbra 9.0.0 Patch 27  Zimbra 8.8.15 Patch 34   All an adversary seeking needs to do to weapo

The International Criminal Police Organization, also called the Interpol, has announced the arrests of 75 individuals as part of a coordinated global operation against an organized cyber crime syndicate called  Black Axe .

The law enforcement effort, codenamed Operation Jackal, involved the participation of Argentina, Australia, Côte d'Ivoire, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Nigeria, Spain, South Africa, the U.A.E, the U.K., and the U.S.   Two of the alleged online scammers, who were arrested late last month in South Africa, are believed to have orchestrated a variety of fraudulent schemes that netted them $1.8 million from victims.
