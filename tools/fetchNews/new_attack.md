Chinese Hackers Exploited FortiGate Flaw to Breach Dutch Military Network<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/chinese-hackers-exploited-fortigate.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Chinese state-backed hackers broke into a computer network that's used by the Dutch armed forces by targeting Fortinet FortiGate devices. "This [computer network] was used for unclassified research and development (R&amp;D)," the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. "Because this system was self-contained, it did not lead to any damage to the defense network." The network had less than 50 users. The intrusion, which took place in 2023, leveraged a known critical security flaw in FortiOS SSL-VPN ( CVE-2022-42475 , CVSS score: 9.3) that allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted requests. Successful exploitation of the flaw paved the way for the deployment of a backdoor dubbed&nbsp; COATHANGER &nbsp;from an actor-controlled server that's designed to grant persistent remote access to the compromised appliances. "The COATHANGER malware is stealthy and persistent," the Dutch N

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Exposed Docker API endpoints over the internet are under assault from a sophisticated cryptojacking campaign called&nbsp; Commando Cat . "The campaign deploys a benign container generated using the&nbsp; Commando project ," Cado security researchers Nate Bill and Matt Muir&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today. "The attacker&nbsp; escapes this container &nbsp;and runs multiple payloads on the Docker host." The campaign is believed to have been active since the start of 2024, making it the second such campaign to be discovered in as many months. In mid-January, the cloud security firm also shed light on&nbsp; another activity cluster &nbsp;that targets vulnerable Docker hosts to deploy XMRig cryptocurrency miner as well as the 9Hits Viewer software. Commando Cat employs Docker as an initial access vector to deliver a collection of interdependent payloads from an actor-controlled server that is responsible for registering persistence, backdooring the host, exfiltrating cloud service provider

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The China-based threat actor known as&nbsp; Mustang Panda &nbsp;is suspected to have targeted Myanmar's Ministry of Defence and Foreign Affairs as part of twin campaigns designed to deploy backdoors and remote access trojans. The findings come from CSIRT-CTI, which said the activities took place in November 2023 and January 2024 after artifacts in connection with the attacks were uploaded to the VirusTotal platform. "The most prominent of these TTPs are the use of legitimate software including a binary developed by engineering firm Bernecker &amp; Rainer (B&amp;R) and a component of the Windows 10 upgrade assistant to sideload malicious dynamic-link libraries (DLLs)," CSIRT-CTI&nbsp; said . Mustang Panda, active since at least 2012, is also recognized by the cybersecurity community under the names BASIN, Bronze President, Camaro Dragon, Earth Preta, HoneyMyte, RedDelta, Red Lich, Stately Taurus, and TEMP.Hex.

A previously undocumented China-aligned threat actor has been linked to a set of adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks that hijack update requests from legitimate software to deliver a sophisticated implant named NSPX30. Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET is tracking the advanced persistent threat (APT) group under the name&nbsp; Blackwood . It's said to be active since at least 2018. The NSPX30 implant has been observed deployed via the update mechanisms of known software such as Tencent QQ, WPS Office, and Sogou Pinyin, with the attacks targeting Chinese and Japanese manufacturing, trading, and engineering companies as well as individuals located in China, Japan, and the U.K. "NSPX30 is a multistage implant that includes several components such as a dropper, an installer, loaders, an orchestrator, and a backdoor," security researcher Facundo Muñoz&nbsp; said .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Go-based malware loader called&nbsp; CherryLoader &nbsp;has been discovered by threat hunters in the wild to deliver additional payloads onto compromised hosts for follow-on exploitation. Arctic Wolf Labs, which discovered the new attack tool in two recent intrusions, said the loader's icon and name masquerades as the legitimate CherryTree note-taking application to dupe potential victims into installing it. "CherryLoader was used to drop one of two privilege escalation tools,&nbsp; PrintSpoofer &nbsp;or&nbsp; JuicyPotatoNG , which would then run a batch file to establish persistence on the victim device," researchers Hady Azzam, Christopher Prest, and Steven Campbell&nbsp; said . In another novel twist, CherryLoader also packs modularized features that allow the threat actor to swap exploits without recompiling code. It's currently not known how the loader is distributed, but the attack chains examined by the cybersecurity firm show that CherryLoader ("cherrytree.exe") and i

New Findings Challenge Attribution in Denmark's Energy Sector Cyberattacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/01/new-findings-challenge-attribution-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The cyber attacks targeting the energy sector in Denmark last year may not have had the involvement of the Russia-linked Sandworm hacking group,&nbsp; new findings &nbsp;from Forescout show. The intrusions, which&nbsp; targeted around 22 Danish energy organizations &nbsp;in May 2023, occurred in two distinct waves, one which exploited a security flaw in Zyxel firewall (CVE-2023-28771) and a follow-on activity cluster that saw the attackers deploy Mirai botnet variants on infected hosts via an as-yet-unknown initial access vector. The first wave took place on May 11, while the second wave lasted from May 22 to 31, 2023. In one such attack detected on May 24, it was observed that the compromised system was communicating with IP addresses (217.57.80[.]18 and 70.62.153[.]174) that were previously used as command-and-control (C2) for the now-dismantled&nbsp; Cyclops Blink &nbsp;botnet.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as five different malware families were deployed by suspected nation-state actors as part of post-exploitation activities leveraging&nbsp; two zero-day vulnerabilities &nbsp;in Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN appliances since early December 2023. "These families allow the threat actors to circumvent authentication and provide backdoor access to these devices," Mandiant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published this week. The Google-owned threat intelligence firm is tracking the threat actor under the moniker&nbsp; UNC5221 .&nbsp; The attacks leverage an exploit chain comprising an authentication bypass flaw (CVE-2023-46805) and a code injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-21887) to take over susceptible instances. Volexity, which attributed the activity to a suspected Chinese espionage actor named UTA0178, said the twin flaws were used to gain initial access, deploy webshells, backdoor legitimate files, capture credentials and configuration data, and pivot further into the victim environment.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Poorly secured Microsoft SQL (MS SQL) servers are being targeted in the U.S., European Union, and Latin American (LATAM) regions as part of an ongoing financially motivated campaign to gain initial access. "The analyzed threat campaign appears to end in one of two ways, either the selling of 'access' to the compromised host, or the ultimate delivery of ransomware payloads," Securonix researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. The campaign, linked to actors of Turkish origin, has been codenamed&nbsp; RE#TURGENCE &nbsp;by the cybersecurity firm. Initial access to the servers entails conducting brute-force attacks, followed by the use of&nbsp; xp_cmdshell configuration option &nbsp;to run shell commands on the compromised host. This activity mirrors that of a prior campaign dubbed&nbsp; DB#JAMMER &nbsp;that came to light in September 2023.

The&nbsp; recent wave of cyber attacks &nbsp;targeting Albanian organizations involved the use of a wiper called&nbsp; No-Justice .

Albanian Parliament and One Albania Telecom Hit by Cyber Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/albanian-parliament-and-one-albania.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Assembly of the Republic of Albania and telecom company One Albania have been targeted by cyber attacks, the country's National Authority for Electronic Certification and Cyber Security (AKCESK) revealed this week. "These infrastructures, under the legislation in force, are not currently classified as critical or important information infrastructure," AKCESK&nbsp; said . One Albania, which has nearly 1.5 million subscribers, said in a&nbsp; Facebook post &nbsp;on December 25 that it had handled the security incident without any issues and that its services, including mobile, landline, and IPTV, remained unaffected. AKCESK further&nbsp; noted &nbsp;that the intrusions did not originate from Albanian IP addresses, adding it managed to "identify potential cases in real-time." The agency also said that it has been focusing its efforts on identifying the source of the attacks, recovering compromised systems, and implementing security measures to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future.

Most Sophisticated iPhone Hack Ever Exploited Apple's Hidden Hardware Feature<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/most-sophisticated-iphone-hack-ever.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The&nbsp; Operation Triangulation &nbsp;spyware attacks targeting Apple iOS devices leveraged never-before-seen exploits that made it possible to even bypass pivotal hardware-based security protections erected by the company. Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;the&nbsp; campaign &nbsp;at the beginning of 2023 after becoming one of the targets,&nbsp; described &nbsp;it as the "most sophisticated attack chain" it has ever observed to date. The campaign is believed to have been active since 2019. The exploitation activity involved the use of four zero-day flaws that were fashioned into a chain to obtain an unprecedented level of access and backdoor target devices running iOS versions up to iOS 16.2 with the ultimate goal of gathering sensitive information. The starting point of the zero-click attack is an iMessage bearing a malicious attachment, which is automatically processed sans any user interaction to ultimately obtain elevated permissions and deploy a spyware module.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Barracuda has revealed that Chinese threat actors exploited a new zero-day in its Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances to deploy backdoors on a "limited number" of devices. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-7102 , the issue relates to a case of&nbsp; arbitrary code execution &nbsp;that resides within a third-party and open-source library named Spreadsheet::ParseExcel that's used by the Amavis scanner within the gateway to screen Microsoft Excel email attachments for malware. The company attributed the activity to a threat actor tracked by Google-owned Mandiant as&nbsp; UNC4841 , which was previously linked to the&nbsp; active exploitation &nbsp;of another zero-day in Barracuda devices (CVE-2023-2868, CVSS score: 9.8) earlier this year. Successful exploitation of the new flaw is accomplished by means of a specially crafted Microsoft Excel email attachment.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian nation-state actor known as&nbsp; MuddyWater &nbsp;has leveraged a newly discovered command-and-control (C2) framework called MuddyC2Go in its attacks on the telecommunications sector in Egypt, Sudan, and Tanzania. The Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, is&nbsp; tracking &nbsp;the activity under the name Seedworm, which is also tracked under the monikers Boggy Serpens, Cobalt Ulster, Earth Vetala, ITG17, Mango Sandstorm (formerly Mercury), Static Kitten, TEMP.Zagros, and Yellow Nix. Active since at least 2017,&nbsp; MuddyWater &nbsp;is assessed to be affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), primarily singling out entities in the Middle East. The cyber espionage group's use of&nbsp; MuddyC2Go &nbsp;was first highlighted by Deep Instinct last month, describing it as a Golang-based replacement for&nbsp; PhonyC2 , itself a successor to MuddyC3. However, there is evidence to suggest that it may have been employed as early as 2020. While the full extent of MuddyC2Go'

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously unknown hacker outfit called&nbsp; GambleForce &nbsp;has been attributed to a series of SQL injection attacks against companies primarily in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region since at least September 2023. "GambleForce uses a set of basic yet very effective techniques, including SQL injections and the exploitation of vulnerable website content management systems (CMS) to steal sensitive information, such as user credentials," Singapore-headquartered Group-IB&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The group is estimated to have targeted 24 organizations in the gambling, government, retail, and travel sectors across Australia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand. Six of these attacks were successful. The modus operandi of GambleForce is its exclusive reliance on open-source tools like dirsearch, sqlmap, tinyproxy, and redis-rogue-getshell at different stages of the attacks with the ultimate goal of exfiltrating sensitive inf

The notorious North Korea-linked threat actor known as the&nbsp; Lazarus Group &nbsp;has been attributed to a new global campaign that involves the opportunistic exploitation of security flaws in Log4j to deploy previously undocumented remote access trojans (RATs) on compromised hosts.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korean threat actor known as&nbsp; Kimsuky &nbsp;has been observed targeting research institutes in South Korea as part of a spear-phishing campaign with the ultimate goal of distributing backdoors on compromised systems. "The threat actor ultimately uses a backdoor to steal information and execute commands," the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis posted last week. The attack chains commence with an import declaration lure that's actually a malicious JSE file containing an obfuscated PowerShell script, a Base64-encoded payload, and a decoy PDF document. The next stage entails opening the PDF file as a diversionary tactic, while the PowerShell script is executed in the background to launch the backdoor. The malware, for its part, is configured to collect network information and other relevant data (i.e., host name, user name, and operating system version) and transmit the encoded details to a remote server. It's also capable of

The network infrastructure used for the attack is said to have gone live around September 2022, with the offensive phase of the intrusion occurring nearly a year later in July 2023, but not before the adversary took steps to improvise its toolset to make it more stealthy in the intervening time perio

Agent Racoon Backdoor Targets Organizations in Middle East, Africa, and U.S.<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/agent-racoon-backdoor-targets.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Organizations in the Middle East, Africa, and the U.S. have been targeted by an unknown threat actor to distribute a new backdoor called&nbsp; Agent Racoon . "This malware family is written using the .NET framework and leverages the domain name service (DNS) protocol to create a covert channel and provide different backdoor functionalities," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researcher Chema Garcia&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Friday analysis. Targets of the attacks span various sectors such as education, real estate, retail, non-profits, telecom, and governments. The activity has not been attributed to a known threat actor, although it's assessed to be a nation-state aligned owing to the victimology pattern and the detection and defense evasion techniques used. The cybersecurity firm is tracking the cluster under the moniker CL-STA-0002. It's currently not clear how these organizations were breached, and when the attacks took place. Some of the other tools deployed by the adversary include

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A suspected Chinese-speaking threat actor has been attributed to a malicious campaign that targets the Uzbekistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and South Korean users with a remote access trojan called&nbsp; SugarGh0st RAT . The activity, which commenced no later than August 2023, leverages two different infection sequences to deliver the malware, which is a customized variant of&nbsp; Gh0st RAT &nbsp;(aka Farfli). It comes with features to "facilitate the remote administration tasks as directed by the C2 and modified communication protocol based on the similarity of the command structure and the strings used in the code," Cisco Talos researchers Ashley Shen and Chetan Raghuprasad&nbsp; said . The attacks commence with a phishing email bearing decoy documents, opening which activates a multi-stage process that leads to the deployment of SugarGh0st RAT. The decoy documents are incorporated within a heavily obfuscated JavaScript dropper that's contained within a Windows Shortcut file embed

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) revealed that it's responding to a cyber attack that involved the active exploitation of Unitronics programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to target the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa in western Pennsylvania. The attack has been attributed to an Iranian-backed hacktivist collective known as Cyber Av3ngers. "Cyber threat actors are targeting PLCs associated with [Water and Wastewater Systems] facilities, including an identified Unitronics PLC, at a U.S. water facility," the agency said . "In response, the affected municipality's water authority immediately took the system offline and switched to manual operations—there is no known risk to the municipality's drinking water or water supply." According to news reports quoted by the Water Information Sharing &amp; Analysis Center (WaterISAC), CyberAv3ngers is alleged to have seized control of the booster station that monitors and regulates

An unspecified government entity in Afghanistan was targeted by a previously undocumented web shell called&nbsp; HrServ &nbsp;in what's suspected to be an advanced persistent threat (APT) attack. The web shell, a dynamic-link library (DLL) named "hrserv.dll," exhibits "sophisticated features such as custom encoding methods for client communication and in-memory execution," Kaspersky security researcher Mert Degirmenci&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published this week. The Russian cybersecurity firm said it identified variants of the malware dating all the way back to early 2021 based on the compilation timestamps of these artifacts. Web shells are typically&nbsp; malicious tools &nbsp;that provide remote control over a compromised server. Once uploaded, it allows threat actors to carry out a range of post-exploitation activities, including data theft, server monitoring, and lateral advancement within the network.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a Rust version of a cross-platform backdoor called&nbsp; SysJoker , which is assessed to have been used by a Hamas-affiliated threat actor to target Israel amid the ongoing war in the region. "Among the most prominent changes is the shift to Rust language, which indicates the malware code was entirely rewritten, while still maintaining similar functionalities," Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday analysis. "In addition, the threat actor moved to using OneDrive instead of Google Drive to store dynamic C2 (command-and-control server) URLs." SysJoker was&nbsp; publicly documented &nbsp;by Intezer in January 2022, describing it as a backdoor capable of gathering system information and establishing contact with an attacker-controlled server by accessing a text file hosted on Google Drive that contains a hard-coded URL. "Being cross-platform allows the malware authors to gain advantage of wide infection on all major platforms," VMware&nbsp; said &nbsp;last year. "SysJo

A North Korean state-sponsored threat actor tracked as&nbsp; Diamond Sleet &nbsp;is distributing a trojanized version of a legitimate application developed by a Taiwanese multimedia software developer called CyberLink to target downstream customers via a supply chain attack.

The poisoned file, the tech giant said, is hosted on the update infrastructure owned by the company while also including checks to limit the time window for execution and bypass detection by security products. The campaign is estimated to have impacted over 100 devices across Japan, Taiwan, Canada, and the U.S. Suspicious activity associated with the modified CyberLink installer file was observed as early as October 20, 2023.

North Korean threat actors have been linked to two campaigns in which they masquerade as both job recruiters and seekers to distribute malware and obtain unauthorized employment with organizations based in the U.S. and other parts of the world. The activity clusters have been codenamed Contagious Interview and Wagemole, respectively, by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42. While the first set of attacks aims to "infect software developers with malware through a fictitious job interview," the latter is designed for financial gain and espionage. "The first campaign's objective is likely cryptocurrency theft and using compromised targets as a staging environment for additional attacks," the cybersecurity company&nbsp; said . The fraudulent job-seeking activity, on the other hand, involves the use of a GitHub repository to host resumes with forged identities that impersonate individuals of various nationalities.

The&nbsp; Kinsing &nbsp;threat actors are actively exploiting a critical security flaw in vulnerable Apache ActiveMQ servers to infect Linux systems with cryptocurrency miners and rootkits.

Russian cyber espionage actors affiliated with the Federal Security Service (FSB) have been observed using a USB propagating worm called&nbsp; LitterDrifter &nbsp;in attacks targeting Ukrainian entities.

The Vietnamese threat actors behind the Ducktail stealer malware have been linked to a new campaign that ran between March and early October 2023, targeting marketing professionals in India with an aim to hijack Facebook business accounts. "An important feature that sets it apart is that, unlike previous campaigns, which relied on .NET applications, this one used Delphi as the programming language," Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. Ducktail , alongside&nbsp; Duckport &nbsp;and&nbsp; NodeStealer , is part of a&nbsp; cybercrime ecosystem &nbsp;operating out of Vietnam, with the attackers primarily using sponsored ads on Facebook to propagate malicious ads and deploy malware capable of plundering victims' login cookies and ultimately taking control of their accounts.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered what they say is malicious cyber activity orchestrated by two prominent Chinese nation-state hacking groups targeting 24 Cambodian government organizations. "This activity is believed to be part of a long-term espionage campaign," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report last week. "The observed activity aligns with geopolitical goals of the Chinese government as it seeks to leverage their strong relations with Cambodia to project their power and expand their naval operations in the region." Targeted organizations include defense, election oversight, human rights, national treasury and finance, commerce, politics, natural resources, and telecommunications. The assessment stems from the persistent nature of inbound network connections originating from these entities to a China-linked adversarial infrastructure that masquerades as cloud backup and storage services over a "period of several months.&amp;qu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor known as Lace Tempest has been linked to the exploitation of a zero-day flaw in SysAid IT support software in limited attacks, according to new findings from Microsoft. Lace Tempest, which is known for distributing the Cl0p ransomware, has in the past leveraged zero-day flaws in&nbsp; MOVEit Transfer &nbsp;and&nbsp; PaperCut servers . The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-47246 , concerns a path traversal flaw that could result in code execution within on-premise installations. It has been patched by SysAid in version 23.3.36 of the software. "After exploiting the vulnerability, Lace Tempest issued commands via the SysAid software to deliver a malware loader for the Gracewire malware," Microsoft&nbsp; said . "This is typically followed by human-operated activity, including lateral movement, data theft, and ransomware deployment."

Multiple ransomware groups have begun to actively exploit recently disclosed flaws in Atlassian Confluence and Apache ActiveMQ. Cybersecurity firm Rapid7&nbsp; said &nbsp;it observed the exploitation of&nbsp; CVE-2023-22518 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-22515 &nbsp;in multiple customer environments, some of which have been leveraged for the deployment of&nbsp; Cerber &nbsp;(aka&nbsp; C3RB3R ) ransomware. Both vulnerabilities are critical, allowing threat actors to create unauthorized Confluence administrator accounts and lead to data loss. Atlassian, on November 6,&nbsp; updated its advisory &nbsp;to note that it observed "several active exploits and reports of threat actors using ransomware" and that it is revising the CVSS score of the flaw from 9.8 to 10.0, indicating maximum severity. The escalation, the Australian company said, is due to the change in the scope of the attack. Attack chains involve mass exploitation of vulnerable internet-facing Atlassian Confluence servers to fetch a malicious payload hosted on a remote s

A threat actor affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) has been observed waging a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign targeting financial, government, military, and telecommunications sectors in the Middle East for at least a year.

The threat actor known as&nbsp; Arid Viper &nbsp;(aka APT-C-23, Desert Falcon, or TAG-63) has been attributed as behind an Android spyware campaign targeting Arabic-speaking users with a counterfeit dating app designed to harvest data from infected handsets.

Hackers Using MSIX App Packages to Infect Windows PCs with GHOSTPULSE Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/10/hackers-using-msix-app-packages-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new cyber attack campaign has been observed using spurious&nbsp; MSIX &nbsp;Windows app package files for popular software such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Grammarly, and Cisco Webex to distribute a novel malware loader dubbed&nbsp; GHOSTPULSE . "MSIX is a Windows app package format that developers can leverage to package, distribute, and install their applications to Windows users," Elastic Security Labs researcher Joe Desimone&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published last week.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korea-aligned&nbsp; Lazarus Group &nbsp;has been attributed as behind a new campaign in which an unnamed software vendor was compromised through the exploitation of known security flaws in another high-profile software. The attack sequences, according to Kaspersky, culminated in the deployment of malware families such as SIGNBT and&nbsp; LPEClient , a known hacking tool used by the threat actor for victim profiling and payload delivery. "The adversary demonstrated a high level of sophistication, employing advanced evasion techniques and introducing SIGNBT malware for victim control," security researcher Seongsu Park&nbsp; said . "The SIGNBT malware used in this attack employed a diverse infection chain and sophisticated techniques." The Russian cybersecurity vendor said the company that developed the exploited software had been a victim of a Lazarus attack several times, indicating an attempt to steal source code or poison the software supply chain, as in the case of the

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian threat actor known as&nbsp; Tortoiseshell &nbsp;has been attributed to a new wave of watering hole attacks that are designed to deploy a malware dubbed IMAPLoader. "IMAPLoader is a .NET malware that has the ability to fingerprint victim systems using native Windows utilities and acts as a downloader for further payloads," the PwC Threat Intelligence&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday analysis. "It uses email as a [command-and-control] channel and is able to execute payloads extracted from email attachments and is executed via new service deployments." Active since at least 2018, Tortoiseshell has a history of using strategic website compromises as a ploy to facilitate the distribution of malware. Earlier this May, ClearSky&nbsp; linked the group &nbsp;to the breach of eight websites associated with shipping, logistics, and financial services companies in Israel. The threat actor is&nbsp; aligned &nbsp;with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) and is also tracked by the broader cyb

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor known as&nbsp; DoNot Team &nbsp;has been linked to the use of a novel .NET-based backdoor called Firebird targeting a handful of victims in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky, which disclosed the findings in its APT trends report Q3 2023, said the attack chains are also configured to deliver a downloader named CSVtyrei, so named for its resemblance to Vtyrei.

A threat actor, presumably from Tunisia, has been linked to a new campaign targeting exposed Jupyter Notebooks in a two-fold attempt to illicitly mine cryptocurrency and breach cloud environments.

The adversarial collective is something of an unusual group in that it conducts both financial motivated and espionage attacks, blurring the line between their modes of operation. It's also exclusively linked to the use of RomCom RAT. Attacks&nbsp; involving the use of the backdoor &nbsp;have singled out Ukraine and countries that support Ukraine in its war against Russia over the past year. Earlier this July, Microsoft implicated Void Rabisu to the exploitation of&nbsp; CVE-2023-36884 , a remote code execution flaw in Office and Windows HTML, by using spe

Microsoft Defender Thwarts Large-Scale Akira Ransomware Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/10/microsoft-defender-thwarts-akira.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Wednesday said that a user containment feature in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint helped thwart a "large-scale remote encryption attempt" made by&nbsp; Akira ransomware actors &nbsp;targeting an unknown industrial organization in early June 2023. The tech giant's threat intelligence team is tracking the operator as Storm-1567. The attack leveraged devices that were not onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as a defense evasion tactic, while also conducting a series of reconnaissance and lateral movement activities prior to encrypting the devices using a compromised user account. But the new&nbsp; automatic attack disruption capability &nbsp;meant that the breached accounts are prevented from "accessing endpoints and other resources in the network, limiting attackers' ability to move laterally regardless of the account's Active Directory state or privilege level." In other words, the idea is to cut off all inbound and outbound communication and proh

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A sophisticated&nbsp; Magecart &nbsp;campaign has been observed manipulating websites' default 404 error page to conceal malicious code in what's been described as the latest evolution of the attacks. The activity, per Akamai, targets Magento and WooCommerce websites, with some of the victims belonging to large organizations in the food and retail industries. "In this campaign, all the victim websites we detected were directly exploited, as the malicious code snippet was injected into one of their first-party resources," Akamai security researcher Roman Lvovsky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday analysis. This involves inserting the code directly into the HTML pages or within one of the first-party scripts that were loaded as part of the website. The attacks are realized through a multi-stage chain, in which the loader code retrieves the main payload during runtime in order to capture the sensitive information entered by visitors on checkout pages and exfiltrate it to a remote server. &amp;

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors have been observed targeting semiconductor companies in East Asia with lures masquerading as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) that are designed to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons. The intrusion set, per&nbsp; EclecticIQ , leverages a backdoor called HyperBro, which is then used as a conduit to deploy the commercial attack simulation software and post-exploitation toolkit. An alternate attack sequence is said to have utilized a previously undocumented malware downloader to deploy Cobalt Strike, indicating that the threat actors devised multiple approaches to infiltrate targets of interest. The Dutch cybersecurity firm attributed the campaign to a China-linked threat actor owing to the use of HyperBro, which has been almost exclusively put to use by a threat actor known as&nbsp; Lucky Mouse &nbsp;(aka APT27, Budworm, and Emissary Panda). Tactical overlaps have also been unearthed between the adversary behind the attacks and another cluster tracked by RecordedFuture un

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A governmental entity in Guyana has been targeted as part of a cyber espionage campaign dubbed&nbsp; Operation Jacana . The&nbsp; activity , which was detected by ESET in February 2023, entailed a spear-phishing attack that led to the deployment of a hitherto undocumented implant written in C++ called DinodasRAT. The Slovak cybersecurity firm said it could link the intrusion to a known threat actor or group, but attributed with medium confidence to a China-nexus adversary owing to the use of&nbsp; PlugX &nbsp;(aka Korplug), a remote access trojan common to Chinese hacking crews. "This campaign was targeted, as the threat actors crafted their emails specifically to entice their chosen victim organization," ESET&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "After successfully compromising an initial but limited set of machines with DinodasRAT, the operators proceeded to move inside and breach the target's internal network, where they again deployed this backdoor."

Microsoft has detailed a new campaign in which attackers unsuccessfully attempted to move laterally to a cloud environment&nbsp;through an SQL Server instance. "The attackers initially exploited a SQL injection vulnerability in an application within the target's environment," security researchers Sunders Bruskin, Hagai Ran Kestenberg, and Fady Nasereldeen&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. "This allowed the attacker to gain access and elevated permissions on a Microsoft SQL Server instance deployed in Azure Virtual Machine (VM)." In the next stage, the threat actors leveraged the new permissions to attempt to move laterally to additional cloud resources by abusing the server's cloud identity, which may possess elevated permissions to likely carry out various malicious actions in the cloud that the identity has access to. Microsoft said it did not find any evidence to suggest that the attackers successfully moved laterally to the cloud resources using the technique

"While this activity occurred around the same time and in some instances even simultaneously on the same victims' machines, each cluster is characterized by distinct tools, modus operandi and infrastructure," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers Lior Rochberger, Tom Fakterman, and Robert Falcone&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an exhaustive three-part report. The attacks, which targeted different governmental entities such as critical infrastructure, public healthcare institutions, public financial administrators and ministries, have been attributed with moderate confidence to three disparate clusters tracked as&nbsp; Stately Taurus &nbsp;(aka Mustang Panda),&nbsp; Alloy Taurus &nbsp;(aka Granite Typhoon), and&nbsp; Gelsemium .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The&nbsp; three zero-day flaws &nbsp;addressed by Apple on September 21, 2023, were leveraged as part of an iPhone exploit chain in an attempt to deliver a spyware strain called&nbsp; Predator &nbsp;targeting former Egyptian member of parliament Ahmed Eltantawy between May and September 2023. "The targeting took place after Eltantawy publicly&nbsp; stated his plans &nbsp;to run for President in the 2024 Egyptian elections," the Citizen Lab&nbsp; said , attributing the attack with high confidence to the Egyptian government owing to it being a known customer of the commercial spying tool. According to a joint investigation conducted by the Canadian interdisciplinary laboratory and Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), the mercenary surveillance tool is said to have been delivered via links sent on SMS and WhatsApp. "In August and September 2023, Eltantawy's Vodafone Egypt mobile connection was persistently selected for targeting via network injection; when Eltantawy visited certain websites not

Iranian Nation-State Actor OilRig Targets Israeli Organizations<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/iranian-nation-state-actor-oilrig.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Israeli organizations were targeted as part of two different campaigns orchestrated by the Iranian nation-state actor known as&nbsp; OilRig &nbsp;in 2021 and 2022. The campaigns, dubbed Outer Space and Juicy Mix, entailed the use of two previously documented first-stage backdoors called Solar and Mango, which were deployed to collect sensitive information from major browsers and the Windows Credential Manager. "Both backdoors were deployed by VBS droppers, presumably spread via spear-phishing emails," ESET security researcher Zuzana Hromcová&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday analysis. OilRig (aka APT34, Cobalt Gypsy, Hazel Sandstorm, and Helix Kitten) is the name assigned to an&nbsp; intrusion set &nbsp;affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). Active since 2014, the threat actor has used a wide range of tools at its disposal to carry out information theft. Earlier this February, Trend Micro&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;OilRig's use of a simple backdoor to steal users' credential

A previously undocumented threat actor dubbed&nbsp; Sandman &nbsp;has been attributed to a set of cyber attacks targeting telecommunic koation providers in the Middle East, Western Europe, and the South Asian subcontinent. Notably, the intrusions leverage a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for the Lua programming language known as LuaJIT as a vehicle to deploy a novel implant called LuaDream . "The activities we observed are characterized by strategic lateral movement to specific targeted workstations and minimal engagement, suggesting a deliberate approach aimed at achieving the set objectives while minimizing the risk of detection," SentinelOne security researcher Aleksandar Milenkoski&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published in collaboration with QGroup. "The implementation of LuaDream indicates a well-executed, maintained, and actively developed project of a considerable scale."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The maintainers of Free Download Manager (FDM) have acknowledged a security incident dating back to 2020 that led to its website being used to distribute malicious Linux software. "It appears that a specific web page on our site was compromised by a Ukrainian hacker group, exploiting it to distribute malicious software," it&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert last week. "Only a small subset of users, specifically those who attempted to download FDM for Linux between 2020 and 2022, were potentially exposed." Less than 0.1% of its visitors are estimated to have encountered the issue, adding it may have been why the problem went undetected until now. The disclosure comes as Kaspersky&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that the project's website was infiltrated at some point in 2020 to redirect select Linux users who attempted to download the software to a malicious site hosting a Debian package. The package was further configured to deploy a DNS-based backdoor and ultimately serve a Bash stealer mal

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Telecommunication service providers in the Middle East are the target of a new intrusion set dubbed&nbsp; ShroudedSnooper &nbsp;that employs a stealthy backdoor called HTTPSnoop. "HTTPSnoop is a simple, yet effective, backdoor that consists of novel techniques to interface with Windows HTTP kernel drivers and devices to listen to incoming requests for specific HTTP(S) URLs and execute that content on the infected endpoint," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. Also part of the threat actor's arsenal is a sister implant codenamed PipeSnoop that can accept arbitrary shellcode from a&nbsp; named pipe &nbsp;and execute it on the infected endpoint. It's suspected that ShroudedSnooper exploits internet-facing servers and deploys HTTPSnoop to gain initial access to target environments, with both the malware strains impersonating components of Palo Alto Networks' Cortex XDR application (" CyveraConsole.exe ") to fly under the radar.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Targets located in Azerbaijan have been singled out as part of a new campaign that's designed to deploy Rust-based malware on compromised systems. Cybersecurity firm Deep Instinct is tracking the operation under the name Operation Rusty Flag. It has not been associated with any known threat actor or group. "The operation has at least two different initial access vectors," security researchers Simon Kenin, Ron Ben Yizhak, and Mark Vaitzman&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. "One of the lures used in the operation is a modified document that was used by the Storm-0978 group. This could be a deliberate 'false flag.'" The attack chain leverages an LNK file named 1.KARABAKH.jpg.lnk as a launchpad to retrieve a second-stage payload, an MSI installer, hosted on Dropbox. The installer file, for its part, drops an implant written in Rust, an XML file for a scheduled task to execute the implant, and a decoy image file that features watermarks of the

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The China-linked threat actor known as&nbsp; Earth Lusca &nbsp;has been observed targeting government entities using a never-before-seen Linux backdoor called SprySOCKS. Earth Lusca was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Trend Micro in January 2022, detailing the adversary's attacks against public and private sector entities across Asia, Australia, Europe, North America. Active since 2021, the group has relied on spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to pull off its cyber espionage schemes. Some activities of the group overlap with another threat cluster tracked by Recorded Future under the name&nbsp; RedHotel . The latest findings from the cybersecurity firm show that Earth Lusca continues to be an active group, even expanding its operations to target organizations across the world during the first half of 2023. Primary targets include government departments that are involved in foreign affairs, technology, and telecommunications. The attacks are concentrated in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and the

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Iranian nation-state actors have been conducting password spray attacks against thousands of organizations globally between February and July 2023, new findings from Microsoft reveal. The tech giant, which is tracking the activity under the name&nbsp; Peach Sandstorm &nbsp;(formerly Holmium), said the adversary pursued organizations in the satellite, defense, and pharmaceutical sectors to likely facilitate intelligence collection in support of Iranian state interests. Should the authentication to an account be successful, the threat actor has been observed using a combination of publicly available and custom tools for discovery, persistence, and lateral movement, followed by data exfiltration in limited cases. Peach Sandstorm , also known by the names APT33, Elfin, and Refined Kitten, has been linked to spear-phishing attacks against aerospace and energy sectors in the past, some of which have entailed the use of the&nbsp; SHAPESHIFT &nbsp;wiper malware. It's said to be active since at least 2013.

The Iranian threat actor known as&nbsp; Charming Kitten &nbsp;has been linked to a new wave of attacks targeting different entities in Brazil, Israel, and the U.A.E. using a previously undocumented backdoor named Sponsor. Slovak cybersecurity firm is tracking the cluster under the name&nbsp; Ballistic Bobcat .

At least 34 victims of Sponsor have been detected to date, with the earliest instances of deployment dating back to September 2021. "The Sponsor backdoor uses configuration files stored on disk," ESET researcher Adam Burgher&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today.

Threat actors associated with North Korea are&nbsp; continuing &nbsp;to&nbsp; target &nbsp;the cybersecurity community using a zero-day bug in an unspecified software over the past several weeks to infiltrate their machines. The findings come from Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), which found the adversary setting up fake accounts on social media platforms like&nbsp; X &nbsp;(formerly Twitter) and&nbsp; Mastodon &nbsp;to forge relationships with potential targets and build trust. "In one case, they carried on a months-long conversation, attempting to collaborate with a security researcher on topics of mutual interest," security researchers Clement Lecigne and Maddie Stone&nbsp; said . "After initial contact via X, they moved to an encrypted messaging app such as Signal, WhatsApp, or Wire."

Okta Warns of Social Engineering Attacks Targeting Super Administrator Privileges<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/okta-warns-of-social-engineering.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Identity services provider Okta on Friday warned of social engineering attacks orchestrated by threat actors to obtain elevated administrator permissions. "In recent weeks, multiple US-based Okta customers have reported a consistent pattern of social engineering attacks against IT service desk personnel, in which the caller's strategy was to convince service desk personnel to reset all multi-factor authentication (MFA) factors enrolled by highly privileged users," the company&nbsp; said . The adversary then moved to abuse the highly privileged Okta Super Administrator accounts to impersonate users within the compromised organization. The campaign, per the company, took place between July 29 and August 19, 2023. Okta did not disclose the identity of the threat actor, but the tactics exhibit all the hallmarks of an activity cluster known as&nbsp; Muddled Libra , which is said to share some degree of overlap with Scattered Spider and Scatter Swine.

Threat Actors Targeting Microsoft SQL Servers to Deploy FreeWorld Ransomware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/threat-actors-targeting-microsoft-sql.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are exploiting poorly secured Microsoft SQL (MS SQL) servers to deliver Cobalt Strike and a ransomware strain called FreeWorld. Cybersecurity firm Securonix, which has dubbed the campaign DB#JAMMER , said it stands out for the way the toolset and infrastructure is employed. "Some of these tools include enumeration software, RAT payloads, exploitation and credential stealing software, and finally ransomware payloads," security researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov said in a technical breakdown of the activity. "The ransomware payload of choice appears to be a newer variant of Mimic ransomware called FreeWorld." Initial access to the victim host is achieved by brute-forcing the MS SQL server, using it to enumerate the database and leveraging the xp_cmdshell configuration option to run shell commands and conduct reconnaissance. The next stage entails taking steps to impair system firewall and establish persistence by connecting to a remote SMB share

Cybersecurity and intelligence agencies from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. on Thursday disclosed details of a mobile malware strain targeting Android devices used by the Ukrainian military. The malicious software, dubbed&nbsp; Infamous Chisel &nbsp;and attributed to a Russian state-sponsored actor called Sandworm, has&nbsp; capabilities &nbsp;to "enable unauthorized access to compromised devices, scan files, monitor traffic, and periodically steal sensitive information." Some aspects of the malware were&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) earlier in August, highlighting unsuccessful attempts on part of the adversary to penetrate Ukrainian military networks and gather valuable intelligence. It's said that Russian forces captured tablets used by Ukraine on the battlefield, using them as a foothold to remotely disseminate the malware to other devices by using the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ) command-line tool.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing attack likely targeting civil society groups in South Korea has led to the discovery of a novel remote access trojan called&nbsp; SuperBear . The intrusion singled out an unnamed activist, who was contacted in late August 2023 and received a malicious LNK file from an address impersonating a member of the organization, non-profit entity Interlabs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. The LNK file, upon execution, launches a PowerShell command to execute a Visual Basic script that, in turn, fetches the next-stage payloads from a legitimate but compromised WordPress website. This includes the Autoit3.exe binary ("solmir.pdb") and an AutoIt script ("solmir_1.pdb") that's launched using the former. The AutoIt script, for its part, performs process injection using a&nbsp; process hollowing technique , in which malicious code is inserted into a process that's in a suspended state. In this case, an instance of Explorer.exe is spawned to inject a never-before-seen RAT referred to as SuperBear th

The Classiscam scam-as-a-service program has reaped the criminal actors $64.5 million in illicit earnings since its emergence in 2019.

"Since then, Classiscam campaigns have become highly automated, and can be run on a host of other services, such as online marketplaces and carpooling sites." A majority of victims are based in Europe (62.2%), followed by the Middle East and Africa (18.2%), and the Asia-Pacific (13%). Germany, Poland, Spain, Italy, and Romania accounted for the highest number of fraudulent transactions registered in Classiscam chats.&nbsp; First discovered in 2019, Classiscam is an&nbsp; umbrella term &nbsp;for an operation that encompasses 1,366 distinct groups on Telegram.

An open-source .NET-based information stealer malware dubbed&nbsp; SapphireStealer &nbsp;is being used by multiple entities to enhance its capabilities and spawn their own bespoke variants. "Information-stealing malware like SapphireStealer can be used to obtain sensitive information, including corporate credentials, which are often resold to other threat actors who leverage the access for additional attacks, including operations related to espionage or ransomware/extortion," Cisco Talos researcher Edmund Brumaghin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. An entire ecosystem has developed over time that allows both financially motivated and nation-state actors to use services from purveyors of stealer malware to carry out various kinds of attacks. Viewed in that light, such malware not only represents an evolution of the cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS) model, they also offer other threat actors to monetize the stolen data to distribute ransomware, conduct data theft, and other maliciou

Hackers Can Exploit Windows Container Isolation Framework to Bypass Endpoint Security<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/hackers-can-exploit-windows-container.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New findings show that malicious actors could leverage a sneaky malware detection evasion technique and bypass endpoint security solutions by manipulating the Windows Container Isolation Framework. The findings were presented by Deep Instinct security researcher Daniel Avinoam at the&nbsp; DEF CON security conference &nbsp;held earlier this month. Microsoft's&nbsp; container architecture &nbsp;(and by extension,&nbsp; Windows Sandbox ) uses what's called a&nbsp; dynamically generated image &nbsp;to separate the file system from each container to the host and at the same time avoid duplication of system files. It's nothing but an "operating system image that has clean copies of files that can change, but links to files that cannot change that are in the Windows image that already exists on the host," thereby bringing down the overall size for a full OS. "The result is images that contain 'ghost files,' which store no actual data but point to a different volume on the system,"

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Android banking trojan dubbed&nbsp; MMRat &nbsp;has been observed targeting mobile users in Southeast Asia since late June 2023 to remotely commandeer the devices and perform financial fraud. "The malware, named after its distinctive package name com.mm.user, can capture user input and screen content, and can also remotely control victim devices through various techniques, enabling its operators to carry out bank fraud on the victim's device," Trend Micro&nbsp; said . What makes MMRat stand apart from others of its kind is the use of a customized command-and-control (C2) protocol based on protocol buffers (aka&nbsp; protobuf ) to efficiently transfer large volumes of data from compromised handsets, demonstrating the growing sophistication of Android malware. Possible targets based on the language used in the phishing pages include Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, and the Philippines.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware has released software updates to correct two security vulnerabilities in Aria Operations for Networks that could be potentially exploited to bypass authentication and gain remote code execution. The most severe of the flaws is CVE-2023-34039 (CVSS score: 9.8), which relates to a case of authentication bypass arising as a result of a lack of unique cryptographic key generation. "A malicious actor with network access to Aria Operations for Networks could bypass SSH authentication to gain access to the Aria Operations for Networks CLI," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. ProjectDiscovery researchers Harsh Jaiswal and Rahul Maini have been credited with discovering and reporting the issue. The second weakness, CVE-2023-20890 (CVSS score: 7.2), is an arbitrary file write vulnerability impacting Aria Operations for Networks that could be abused by an adversary with administrative access to write files to arbitrary locations and achieve remote code execution.

Ask any security professional and they'll tell you that remediating risks from various siloed security scanning tools requires a tedious and labor-intensive series of steps focused on deduplication, prioritization, and routing of issues to an appropriate "fixer" somewhere in the organization. This burden on already resource-strapped security teams is an efficiency killer.&nbsp; A new study , commissioned by Seemplicity and conducted by Dark Reading, provides fresh insight into how security pros handle the challenging remediation life cycle from discovery to resolution. The research reveals the obstacles security professionals face when coordinating remediation activities. The data exposes the outcomes — in increased workload and diminished risk posture — that arise from lengthy remediation times, inefficient and uncontrolled manual processes, the lack of managerial visibility and oversight across the risk life cycle.&nbsp; Remediation Process Broken Down to Steps and Time Spent on Each Step

Citrix NetScaler Alert: Ransomware Hackers Exploiting Critical Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/citrix-netscaler-alert-ransomware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Unpatched Citrix NetScaler systems exposed to the internet are being targeted by unknown threat actors in what's suspected to be a ransomware attack. Cybersecurity company Sophos is&nbsp; tracking &nbsp;the activity cluster under the moniker&nbsp; STAC4663 . Attack chains involve the exploitation of&nbsp; CVE-2023-3519 , a critical code injection vulnerability impacting NetScaler ADC and Gateway servers that could facilitate unauthenticated remote code execution. In one intrusion detected in mid-August 2023, the security flaw is said to have been used to conduct a domain-wide attack, including injecting payloads into legitimate executables such as the Windows Update Agent (wuauclt.exe) and the Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Service (wmiprvse.exe). An analysis of the payload is underway. Other notable aspects include the distribution of obfuscated PowerShell scripts, PHP web shells, and the use of an Estonian service called BlueVPS for malware staging. Sophos said the modus operandi

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning of an increase in adversary-in-the-middle ( AiTM ) phishing techniques, which are being propagated as part of the phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) cybercrime model. In addition to an uptick in AiTM-capable PhaaS platforms, the tech giant noted that existing phishing services like PerSwaysion are incorporating AiTM capabilities. "This development in the PhaaS ecosystem enables attackers to conduct high-volume phishing campaigns that attempt to circumvent MFA protections at scale," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). Phishing kits with AiTM capabilities work in two ways, one of which concerns the use of reverse proxy servers (i.e., the phishing page) to relay traffic to and from the client and legitimate website and stealthily capture user credentials, two-factor authentication codes, and session cookies. A second method involves synchronous relay servers. "In AiTM through synchronous relay s

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a case of privilege escalation associated with a Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) application by taking advantage of an abandoned reply URL. "An attacker could leverage this abandoned URL to redirect authorization codes to themselves, exchanging the ill-gotten authorization codes for access tokens," Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published last week. "The threat actor could then call Power Platform API via a middle-tier service and obtain elevated privileges." Following responsible disclosure on April 5, 2023, the issue was addressed by Microsoft via an update released a day later. Secureworks has also made available an&nbsp; open-source tool &nbsp;that other organizations can use to scan for abandoned reply URLs. Reply URL , also called redirect URI, refers to the location where the authorization server sends the user once the app has been successfully authorized and grant

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In yet another sign that developers continue to be targets of software supply chain attacks, a number of malicious packages have been discovered on the Rust programming language's crate registry. The libraries, uploaded between August 14 and 16, 2023, were published by a user named "amaperf," Phylum&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. The names of the packages, now taken down, are as follows: postgress, if-cfg, xrvrv, serd, oncecell, lazystatic, and envlogger. It's not clear what the end goal of the campaign was, but the suspicious modules were found to harbor functionalities to capture the operating system information (i.e., Windows, Linux, macOS, or Unknown) and transmit the data to a hard-coded Telegram channel via the messaging platform's API. This suggests that the campaign may have been in its early stages and that the threat actor may have been casting a wide net to compromise as many developer machines as possible to deliver rogue updates with imp

Cyber attacks on e-commerce applications are a common trend in 2023 as e-commerce businesses become more omnichannel, they build and deploy increasingly more API interfaces, with threat actors constantly exploring more ways to exploit vulnerabilities. This is why regular testing and ongoing monitoring are necessary to fully protect web applications, identifying weaknesses so they can be mitigated quickly. In this article, we will discuss the recent Honda e-commerce platform attack, how it happened, and its impact on the business and its clients. In addition, to the importance of application security testing, we will also discuss the different areas of vulnerability testing and its various phases. Finally, we will provide details on how a long-term preventative solution such as&nbsp; PTaaS &nbsp;can protect e-commerce businesses and the differences between continuous testing (PTaaS) and standard pen testing.

An updated version of a botnet malware called&nbsp; KmsdBot &nbsp;is now targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices, simultaneously branching out its capabilities and the attack surface. "The binary now includes support for&nbsp; Telnet scanning &nbsp;and support for more CPU architectures," Akamai security researcher Larry W.

The latest iteration, observed since July 16, 2023, comes months after it emerged that the botnet is being offered as a&nbsp; DDoS-for-hire service &nbsp;to other threat actors. The fact that it's being actively maintained indicates its effectiveness in real-world attacks. KmsdBot was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by the web infrastructure and security company in November 2022. It's mainly designed to target private gaming servers and cloud hosting providers, although it has since set its eyes on some Romanian government and Spanish educational sites.

LockBit 3.0 Ransomware Builder Leak Gives Rise to Hundreds of New Variants<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/lockbit-30-ransomware-builder-leak.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The leak of the&nbsp; LockBit 3.0 ransomware &nbsp;builder last year has led to threat actors abusing the tool to spawn new variants. Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky said it detected a ransomware intrusion that deployed a version of LockBit but with a markedly different ransom demand procedure. "The attacker behind this incident decided to use a different ransom note with a headline related to a previously unknown group, called NATIONAL HAZARD AGENCY," security researchers Eduardo Ovalle and Francesco Figurelli&nbsp; said . The revamped ransom note directly specified the amount to be paid to obtain the decryption keys, and directed communications to a Tox service and email, unlike the LockBit group, which doesn't mention the amount and uses its own communication and negotiation platform. NATIONAL HAZARD AGENCY is far from the only cybercrime gang to use the leaked LockBit 3.0 builder. Some of the other threat actors known to leverage it include&nbsp; Bl00dy and Buhti . Kaspersk

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Risk and financial advisory solutions provider Kroll on Friday disclosed that one of its employees fell victim to a "highly sophisticated" SIM swapping attack. The incident, which took place on August 19, 2023, targeted the employee's T-Mobile account, the company said. "Specifically, T-Mobile, without any authority from or contact with Kroll or its employee, transferred that employee's phone number to the threat actor's phone at their request," it&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. This enabled the unidentified actor to gain access to certain files containing personal information of bankruptcy claimants in the matters of BlockFi , FTX , and Genesis. SIM swapping (aka SIM splitting or simjacking), while generally a benign process, could be exploited by threat actors to fraudulently activate a SIM card under their control with a victim's phone number. This makes it possible to intercept SMS messages and voice calls and receive MFA-related messages that cont

Both the defendants were initially arrested and released under investigation in January 2022, only to be&nbsp; re-arrested and charged &nbsp;by the City of London Police in April 2022. Kurtaj was subsequently granted bail and moved to a hotel in Bicester after he was doxxed in an online cybercrime forum.

Every company has some level of tech debt. Unless you're a brand new start-up, you most likely have a patchwork of solutions that have been implemented throughout the years, often under various leadership teams with different priorities and goals. As those technologies age, they can leave your organization vulnerable to cyber threats. While replacing legacy technologies can be costly, those costs may pale in comparison to a breach – both in terms of immediate financial impact and reputational damage.&nbsp; Here are three ways you can communicate risk to your leadership team as you work to replace legacy infrastructure. 1: Make the Risk Real Leadership teams are driven by quantifiable business implications. The best way to get support for updating or replacing legacy technology is to make the risk to the business real - and measurable - in a language they understand. One way to do this is to look at the list of critical vulnerabilities that you've identified, then evaluate the impact t

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning that Barracuda Networks Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances patched against a recently disclosed critical flaw continue to be at risk of potential compromise from suspected Chinese hacking groups. It also&nbsp; deemed &nbsp;the fixes as "ineffective" and that it "continues to observe active intrusions and considers all affected Barracuda ESG appliances to be compromised and vulnerable to this exploit." Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-2868 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the zero-day bug is said to have been weaponized as early as October 2022, more than seven months before the security hole was plugged. Google-owned Mandiant is tracking the China-nexus activity cluster under the name&nbsp; UNC4841 . The remote command injection vulnerability, impacting versions 5.1.3.001 through 9.2.0.006, allows for unauthorized execution of system commands with administrator privileges on the ESG product.

The North Korea-linked threat actor known as Lazarus Group has been observed exploiting a now-patched critical security flaw impacting Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus to distribute a remote access trojan called such as&nbsp; QuiteRAT . Targets include internet backbone infrastructure and healthcare entities in Europe and the U.S., cybersecurity company Cisco Talos said in a&nbsp; two-part &nbsp; analysis &nbsp;published today. What's more, a closer examination of the adversary's recycled attack infrastructure in its cyber assaults on enterprises has led to the discovery of a new threat dubbed&nbsp; CollectionRAT . The fact that the Lazarus Group continues to rely on the same tradecraft despite those components being well-documented over the years underscores the threat actor's confidence in their operations, Talos pointed out. QuiteRAT is said to be a successor to&nbsp; MagicRAT , itself a follow-up to TigerRAT, while CollectionRAT appears to share overlaps with&nbsp; EarlyRAT &nbsp;(aka&nbsp; Jupiter ), an im

A new financially motivated operation is leveraging a malicious Telegram bot to help threat actors scam their victims.

"This toolkit is implemented as a Telegram bot that, when activated, provides several easy-to-navigate menus in the form of clickable buttons that can accommodate many scammers at once," ESET researcher Radek Jizba&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The exact origins of the threat actors, dubbed Neanderthals, are unclear, but evidence points to Russia as the country of origin of the toolkit's authors and users, owing to the use of Russian SMS templates and the fact that a majority of the targeted online marketplaces are popular in the country.

Public Wi-Fi, which has long since become the norm, poses threats to not only individual users but also businesses. With the rise of remote work, people can now work from virtually anywhere: a cafe close to home, a hotel in a different city, or even while waiting for a plane at the airport. Next, let's explore the risks of connecting to public Wi-Fi, both for you personally and for businesses. According to the&nbsp; Forbes Advisor &nbsp;the majority of people (56%) connect to public Wi-Fi networks that don't require a password. This convenience comes at a price, and many are unaware that attackers can steal card details, passwords, and other sensitive information. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: &nbsp;This is one of the most common threats on public Wi-Fi. In an MITM attack, the hacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties.

The SmokeLoader malware is being used to deliver a new Wi-Fi scanning malware strain called&nbsp; Whiffy Recon &nbsp;on compromised Windows machines. "The new malware strain has only one operation.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recently patched security flaw in the popular WinRAR archiving software has been exploited as a zero-day since April 2023, new findings from Group-IB reveal. The vulnerability, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38831 , allows threat actors to spoof file extensions, thereby making it possible to launch malicious scripts contained within an archive that masquerades as seemingly innocuous image or text files. It was addressed in&nbsp; version 6.23 &nbsp;released on August 2, 2023, alongside CVE-2023-40477. In attacks discovered by the Singapore-based firm in July 2023, specially crafted ZIP or RAR archive files distributed via trading-related forums such as Forex Station have been used to deliver a variety of malware families such as DarkMe,&nbsp; GuLoader , and&nbsp; Remcos RAT . "After infecting devices, the cybercriminals withdraw money from broker accounts," Group-IB malware analyst Andrey Polovinkin&nbsp; said , adding as many as 130 traders' devices have been compromised as part of the campaign.

Thousands of&nbsp; Openfire XMPP servers &nbsp;are unpatched against a recently disclosed high-severity flaw and are susceptible to a new exploit, according to a&nbsp; new report &nbsp;from VulnCheck. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-32315 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5), the vulnerability relates to a path traversal vulnerability in Openfire's administrative console that could permit an unauthenticated attacker to access otherwise restricted pages reserved for privileged users. It affects all versions of the software released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0. It was remediated by its developer, Ignite Realtime, earlier this May with the release of versions 4.6.8, 4.7.5, and 4.8.0. "Path traversal protections were already in place to protect against exactly this kind of attack, but didn't defend against certain non-standard URL encoding for UTF-16 characters that were not supported by the embedded web server that was in use at the time," the maintainers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a detailed advisory.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) on Wednesday&nbsp; unsealed an indictment &nbsp;against two founders of the now-sanctioned Tornado Cash cryptocurrency mixer service, charging them with laundering more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds. Both the individuals, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Storm, 34, is said to have been arrested in the U.S. state of Washington. Semenov, 35, remains at large in Dubai. They are alleged to have "made millions of dollars in profits" from promoting and operating the service. Tornado Cash is estimated to have processed upwards of $7 billion worth of crypto assets over a period of three years. In a related move, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned &nbsp;Semenov and&nbsp; eight cryptocurrency addresses &nbsp;connected to him, days after a U.S. cou

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Tuesday warned that threat actors affiliated with North Korea may attempt to cash out stolen cryptocurrency worth more than $40 million. The law enforcement agency&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the blockchain activity to an adversary the U.S. government tracks as TraderTraitor, which is also known by the name Jade Sleet. An investigation undertaken by the FBI found that the group moved approximately 1,580 bitcoin from several cryptocurrency heists over the past 24 hours and are currently said to be holding those funds in six different wallets. North Korea is known to blur the lines among cyber warfare, espionage, and financial crime.&nbsp; TraderTraitor , in particular, has been linked to a series of attacks targeting blockchain and cryptocurrency exchanges with the goal of plundering digital assets to generate illicit revenue for the sanctions-hit nation. This includes the $60 million theft of virtual currency from Alphapo on June 22, 2023; the $37 m

Meta has once again reaffirmed its plans to roll out support for end-to-end encryption ( E2EE ) by default for one-to-one friends and family chats on Messenger by the end of the year. As part of that effort, the social media giant said it's upgrading "millions more people's chats" effective August 22, 2023, exactly seven months after it&nbsp; started gradually expanding the feature &nbsp;to more users in January 2023. The changes are part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's "privacy-focused vision for social networking" that was announced in 2019, although it has since encountered significant technical challenges, causing it to&nbsp; delay its plans &nbsp;by a year. "Like many messaging services, Messenger and Instagram DMs were originally designed to function via servers," Timothy Buck, product manager for Messenger,&nbsp; said . "Meta's servers act as the gateway between the message sender and receiver, what we call the clients." However, the addition of an

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Syrian threat actor named&nbsp; EVLF &nbsp;has been outed as the creator of malware families CypherRAT and CraxsRAT. "These RATs are designed to allow an attacker to remotely perform real-time actions and control the victim device's camera, location, and microphone," Cybersecurity firm Cyfirma&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. CypherRAT and CraxsRAT are said to be offered to other cybercriminals as part of a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) scheme. As many as 100 unique threat actors are estimated to have purchased the twin tools on a lifetime license over the past three years. EVLF is said to be operating a web shop to advertise their warez since at least September 2022. CraxsRAT is billed as an Android trojan that enables a threat actor to remote control an infected device from a Windows computer, with the developer consistently releasing new updates based on feedback from the customers.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious toolset dubbed&nbsp; Spacecolon &nbsp;is being deployed as part of an ongoing campaign to spread variants of the Scarab ransomware across victim organizations globally. "It probably finds its way into victim organizations by its operators compromising vulnerable web servers or via brute forcing RDP credentials," ESET security researcher Jakub Souček&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a detailed technical write-up published Tuesday. The Slovak cybersecurity firm, which dubbed the threat actor CosmicBeetle, said the origins of the Spacecolon date back to May 2020. The highest concentration of victims has been detected in France, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and Turkey. While the exact provenance of the adversary is unclear, several Spacecolon variants are said to contain Turkish strings, likely pointing to the involvement of a Turkish-speaking developer. There is no evidence currently linking it to any other known threat actor group. Some of the targets include a hospital and a tourist reso

More than a dozen malicious packages have been discovered on the npm package repository since the start of August 2023 with capabilities to deploy an open-source information stealer called&nbsp; Luna Token Grabber &nbsp;on systems belonging to Roblox developers. The ongoing campaign, first detected on August 1 by ReversingLabs, employs modules that masquerade as the legitimate package&nbsp; noblox.js , an API wrapper that's used to create scripts that interact with the Roblox gaming platform. The software supply chain security company described the activity as a "replay of an attack&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;two years ago" in October 2021. "The malicious packages [...] reproduce code from the legitimate noblox.js package but add malicious, information-stealing functions," software threat researcher Lucija Valentić&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented threat cluster has been linked to a software supply chain attack targeting organizations primarily located in Hong Kong and other regions in Asia. The Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, is tracking the activity under its insect-themed moniker Carderbee. The attacks, per the cybersecurity firm, leverage a trojanized version of a legitimate software called EsafeNet Cobra DocGuard Client to deliver a known backdoor called&nbsp; PlugX &nbsp;(aka Korplug) on victim networks. "In the course of this attack, the attackers used malware signed with a legitimate Microsoft certificate," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The use of Cobra DocGuard Client to pull off a supply chain attack was previously highlighted by ESET in its&nbsp; quarterly Threat Report &nbsp;this year, detailing a September 2022 intrusion in which an unnamed gambling company in Hong Kong was compromised via a malicious update pushed by the software.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new variant of an&nbsp; Apple macOS malware &nbsp;called&nbsp; XLoader &nbsp;has surfaced in the wild, masquerading its malicious features under the guise of an office productivity app called "OfficeNote." "The new version of XLoader is bundled inside a standard Apple disk image with the name OfficeNote.dmg," SentinelOne security researchers Dinesh Devadoss and Phil Stokes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday analysis. "The application contained within is signed with the developer signature MAIT JAKHU (54YDV8NU9C)." XLoader , first detected in 2020, is&nbsp; considered &nbsp;a successor to Formbook and is an information stealer and keylogger offered under the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model. A macOS variant of the malware emerged in July 2021, distributed as a Java program in the form of a compiled .JAR file. "Such files require the Java Runtime Environment, and for that reason the malicious .jar file will not execute on a macOS install out of the box, since Apple stopped shipping JRE with

Software services provider Ivanti is&nbsp; warning &nbsp;of a new critical zero-day flaw impacting Ivanti Sentry (formerly MobileIron Sentry) that it said is being actively exploited in the wild, marking an escalation of its security woes. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38035 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the issue has been described as a case of authentication bypass impacting versions 9.18 and prior due to what it called an due to an insufficiently restrictive Apache HTTPD configuration. "If exploited, this vulnerability enables an unauthenticated actor to access some sensitive APIs that are used to configure the Ivanti Sentry on the administrator portal (port 8443, commonly MICS)," the company&nbsp; said . "While the issue has a high CVSS score, there is a low risk of exploitation for customers who do not expose port 8443 to the internet." Successful exploitation of the bug could allow an attacker to change configuration, run system commands, or write files onto the system. It's recommen

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; added &nbsp;a critical security flaw in Adobe ColdFusion to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. The vulnerability, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-26359 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), relates to a deserialization flaw present in Adobe ColdFusion 2018 (Update 15 and earlier) and ColdFusion 2021 (Update 5 and earlier) that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user without requiring any interaction. Deserialization &nbsp;(aka unmarshaling) refers to the process of reconstructing a data structure or an object from a byte stream. But when it's performed without validating its source or sanitizing its contents, it can lead to&nbsp; unexpected consequences &nbsp;such as code execution or denial-of-service (DoS). It was&nbsp; patched &nbsp;by Adobe as part of updates issued in March 2023. As of writing, it's immediately not clear how the flaw is being&nbsp; abused in the wil

From a user's perspective, OAuth works like magic. In just a few keystrokes, you can whisk through the account creation process and gain immediate access to whatever new app or integration you're seeking. Unfortunately, few users understand the implications of the permissions they allow when they create a new OAuth grant, making it easy for malicious actors to manipulate employees into giving away unintended access to corporate environments. In one of the&nbsp; highest-profile examples , Pawn Storm's attacks against the Democratic National Convention and others leveraged OAuth to target victims through social engineering.&nbsp; Security and IT teams would be wise to establish a practice of reviewing new and existing OAuth grants programmatically to catch risky activity or overly-permissive scopes. And, there are new solutions for&nbsp; SaaS security &nbsp;cropping up that can make this process easier.

"Although the proxy website claims that its exit nodes come only from users who have been informed and agreed to the use of their device," the cybersecurity company&nbsp; said &nbsp;it found evidence where "malware writers are installing the proxy silently in infected systems." Multiple malware families have been observed delivering the proxy to users searching for cracked software and games.

HiatusRAT Malware Resurfaces: Taiwan Firms and U.S. Military Under Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/hiatusrat-malware-resurfaces-taiwan.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind the HiatusRAT malware have returned from their hiatus with a new wave of reconnaissance and targeting activity aimed at Taiwan-based organizations and a U.S. military procurement system. Besides recompiling malware samples for different architectures, the artifacts are said to have been hosted on new virtual private servers (VPSs), Lumen Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. The cybersecurity firm described the activity cluster as "brazen" and "one of the most audacious," indicating no signs of slowing down. The identity and the origin of the threat actors are presently unknown. Targets included commercial firms, such as semiconductor and chemical manufacturers, and at least one municipal government organization in Taiwan as well as a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) server associated with submitting and retrieving proposals for defense contracts. HiatusRAT was&nbsp; first disclosed &nbsp;by the cybersecurity company in March

WoofLocker Toolkit Hides Malicious Codes in Images to Run Tech Support Scams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/wooflocker-toolkit-hides-malicious.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed an updated version of an advanced fingerprinting and redirection toolkit called&nbsp; WoofLocker &nbsp;that's engineered to conduct tech support scams. The sophisticated traffic redirection scheme was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Malwarebytes in January 2020, leveraging JavaScript embedded in compromised websites to perform anti-bot and web traffic filtering checks to serve next-stage JavaScript that redirects users to a browser locker (aka browlock). This redirection mechanism, in turn, makes use of steganographic tricks to conceal the JavaScript code within a PNG image that's served only when the validation phase is successful. Should a user be detected as a bot or not interesting traffic, a decoy PNG file without the malicious code is used. WoofLocker is also known as 404Browlock due to the fact that visiting the browlock URL directly without the appropriate redirection or one-time session token results in a 404 error page.

Networking hardware company Juniper Networks has released an "out-of-cycle" security update to address multiple flaws in the J-Web component of Junos OS that could be combined to achieve remote code execution on susceptible installations. The four vulnerabilities have a cumulative CVSS rating of 9.8, making them Critical in severity. They affect all versions of Junos OS on SRX and EX Series. "By chaining exploitation of these vulnerabilities, an unauthenticated, network-based attacker may be able to remotely execute code on the devices," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory released on August 17, 2023. The J-Web interface allows users to configure, manage, and monitor Junos OS devices. A brief description of the flaws is as follows - CVE-2023-36844 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-36845 &nbsp;(CVSS scores: 5.3) - Two PHP external variable modification vulnerabilities in J-Web of Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX Series and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to

Thousands of Android Malware Apps Using Stealthy APK Compression to Evade Detection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/thousands-of-android-malware-apps-using.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are using Android Package (APK) files with unknown or unsupported compression methods to elude malware analysis. That's according to findings from Zimperium, which found 3,300 artifacts leveraging such compression algorithms in the wild. 71 of the identified samples can be loaded on the operating system without any problems. There is no evidence that the apps were available on the Google Play Store at any point in time, indicating that the apps were distributed through other means, typically via untrusted app stores or social engineering to trick the victims into sideloading them. The APK files use "a technique that limits the possibility of decompiling the application for a large number of tools, reducing the possibilities of being analyzed," security researcher Fernando Ortega&nbsp; said . "In order to do that, the APK (which is in essence a ZIP file), is using an unsupported decompression method." The advantage of such an approach is its abilit

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A coordinated law enforcement operation across 25 African countries has led to the arrest of 14 suspected cybercriminals, INTERPOL&nbsp; announced &nbsp;Friday. The exercise, conducted in partnership with AFRIPOL, enabled investigators to identify 20,674 cyber networks that were linked to financial losses of more than $40 million. "The four-month Africa Cyber Surge II operation was launched in April 2023 and focused on identifying cybercriminals and compromised infrastructure," the agency said. As part of the operation, three suspects were arrested in Cameroon in connection with an online scam involving the fraudulent sale of works of art worth $850,000. Another suspect was arrested in Nigeria for defrauding a Gambian victim. Also arrested were two money mules linked to scams initiated through messaging platforms. The cyber networks comprised 3,786 command-and-control (C2) servers, 14,134 victim IP addresses tied to data stealer infections, 1,415 phishing links and domains, 939

Due to a plausibility check error, the digital signature, which was only intended for private customer accounts (MSA), also worked in the Azure Active Directory for business customers.&nbsp; Embracing the Zero Trust Revolution Acc

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new "mass-spreading" social engineering campaign is targeting users of the Zimbra Collaboration email server with an aim to collect their login credentials for use in follow-on operations. The activity, active since April 2023 and still ongoing, targets a wide range of small and medium businesses and governmental entities, most of which are located in Poland, Ecuador, Mexico, Italy, and Russia. It has not been attributed to any known threat actor or group. "Initially, the target receives an email with a phishing page in the attached HTML file," ESET researcher Viktor Šperka&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "The email warns the target about an email server update, account deactivation, or similar issue and directs the user to click on the attached file." The messages also spoof the from address to appear as if they are coming from a Zimbra administrator in a likely attempt to convince the recipients into opening the attachment.

Microsoft on Thursday disclosed that it found a new version of the&nbsp; BlackCat &nbsp;ransomware (aka ALPHV and Noberus) that embeds tools like Impacket and RemCom to facilitate lateral movement and remote code execution. "The&nbsp; Impacket tool &nbsp;has credential dumping and remote service execution modules that could be used for broad deployment of the BlackCat ransomware in target environments," the company's threat intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). "This BlackCat version also has the&nbsp; RemCom hacktool &nbsp;embedded in the executable for remote code execution. The file also contains hardcoded compromised target credentials that actors use for lateral movement and further ransomware deployment." RemCom, billed as an open-source alternative to PsExec, has been put to use by Chinese and Iranian nation-state threat actors like&nbsp; Dalbit &nbsp;and&nbsp; Chafer &nbsp;(aka Remix Kitten) to move across the victim environments in the past.

Google has announced plans to add a new feature in the upcoming version of its Chrome web browser to alert users when an extension they have installed has been removed from the Chrome Web Store. The feature, set for release alongside Chrome 117, allows users to be notified when an add-on has been unpublished by a developer, taken down for violating Chrome Web Store policy, or marked as malware. The tech giant said it intends to highlight such extensions under a "Safety check" category in the "Privacy and security" section of the browser settings page. "When a user clicks 'Review,' they will be taken to their extensions and given the choice to either remove the extension or hide the warning if they wish to keep the extension installed," Oliver Dunk, a developer relations engineer for Chrome extensions,&nbsp; said .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undetected attack method called&nbsp; NoFilter &nbsp;has been found to abuse the Windows Filtering Platform ( WFP ) to achieve privilege escalation in the Windows operating system. "If an attacker has the ability to execute code with admin privilege and the target is to perform&nbsp; LSASS Shtinkering , these privileges are not enough," Ron Ben Yizhak, a security researcher at Deep Instinct, told The Hacker News. "Running as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" is required. The techniques described in this research can escalate from admin to SYSTEM." The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;were presented at the DEF CON security conference over the weekend. The starting point of the&nbsp; research &nbsp;is an in-house tool called RPC Mapper the cybersecurity company used to map remote procedure call ( RPC ) methods, specifically those that invoke&nbsp; WinAPI , leading to the discovery of a method named "BfeRpcOpenToken," which is part of WFP.

An ongoing cyber attack campaign originating from China is targeting the Southeast Asian gambling sector to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons on compromised systems.&nbsp; Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne said the tactics, techniques, and procedures point to the involvement of a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; Bronze Starlight &nbsp;(aka Emperor Dragonfly or Storm-0401), which has been linked to the use of&nbsp; short-lived &nbsp; ransomware families &nbsp;as a smokescreen to conceal its espionage motives.

New Apple iOS 16 Exploit Enables Stealthy Cellular Access Under Fake Airplane Mode<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-apple-ios-16-exploit-enables.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have documented a novel post-exploit persistence technique on iOS 16 that could be abused to fly under the radar and maintain access to an Apple device even when the victim believes it is offline. The method "tricks the victim into thinking their device's Airplane Mode works when in reality the attacker (following successful device exploit) has planted an artificial Airplane Mode which edits the UI to display Airplane Mode icon and cuts internet connection to all apps except the attacker application," Jamf Threat Labs researchers Hu Ke and Nir Avraham said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Airplane Mode , as the name implies, allows users to turn off wireless features in their devices, effectively preventing them from connecting to Wi-Fi networks, cellular data, and Bluetooth as well as sending or receiving calls and text messages. The approach devised by Jamf, in a nutshell, provides an illusion to the user that the Airplane Mode is

New LABRAT Campaign Exploits GitLab Flaw for Cryptojacking and Proxyjacking Activities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-labrat-campaign-exploits-gitlab.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new, financially motivated operation dubbed&nbsp; LABRAT &nbsp;has been observed weaponizing a now-patched critical flaw in GitLab as part of a cryptojacking and proxyjacking campaign. "The attacker utilized undetected signature-based tools, sophisticated and stealthy cross-platform malware, command-and-control (C2) tools which bypassed firewalls, and kernel-based rootkits to hide their presence," Sysdig&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Furthermore, the attacker abused a legitimate service,&nbsp; TryCloudflare , to obfuscate their C2 network." Proxyjacking &nbsp;allows the attacker to rent the compromised host out to a proxy network, making it possible to monetize the unused bandwidth. Cryptojacking, on the other hand, refers to the abuse of the system resources to mine cryptocurrency. A notable aspect of the campaign is the use of compiled binaries written in Go and .NET to fly under the radar, with LABRAT also providing backdoor access to the infected systems.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hitherto undocumented threat actor operating for nearly a decade and codenamed&nbsp; MoustachedBouncer has been attributed to cyber espionage attacks aimed at foreign embassies in Belarus. "Since 2020, MoustachedBouncer has most likely been able to perform adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks at the ISP level, within Belarus, in order to compromise its targets," ESET security researcher Matthieu Faou&nbsp; said , describing the group as skilled and advanced. The adversary, active since at least 2014, is assessed to be aligned with Belarusian interests, likely employing a lawful interception system such as&nbsp; SORM &nbsp;to conduct its AitM attacks as well as deploy disparate tools called NightClub and Disco. Both the Windows malware frameworks support additional spying plugins including a screenshotter, an audio recorder, and a file stealer. The oldest sample of NightClub dates back to November 19, 2014, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal from Ukraine. Embassy staff from four differ

Google has announced plans to add support for quantum-resistant encryption algorithms in its Chrome browser, starting with version 116. "Chrome will begin supporting&nbsp; X25519Kyber768 &nbsp;for establishing symmetric secrets in&nbsp; TLS , starting in Chrome 116, and available behind a flag in Chrome 115," Devon O'Brien&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post published Thursday. Kyber was&nbsp; chosen &nbsp;by the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the candidate for general encryption in a bid to tackle future cyber attacks posed by the advent of quantum computing.&nbsp; Kyber-768 &nbsp;is roughly the security equivalent of&nbsp; AES-192 . The encryption algorithm has already been adopted by&nbsp; Cloudflare ,&nbsp; Amazon Web Services , and IBM. X25519Kyber768 is a hybrid algorithm that combines the output of&nbsp; X25519 , an elliptic curve algorithm widely used for key agreement in TLS, and Kyber-768 to create a strong session key to encrypt TLS connections.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Chinese threat actor known as APT31 (aka Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, or Violet Typhoon) has been linked to a set of advanced backdoors that are capable of exfiltrating harvested sensitive information to Dropbox. The malware is part of a broader collection of&nbsp; more than 15 implants &nbsp;that have been put to use by the adversary in attacks targeting industrial organizations in Eastern Europe in 2022. "The attackers aimed to establish a permanent channel for data exfiltration, including data stored on air-gapped systems," Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis spotlighting APT31's previously undocumented tradecraft. The intrusions employ a three-stage malware stack, each focused on disparate aspects of the attack chain: setting up persistence, gathering sensitive data, and transmitting the information to a remote server under the threat actor's control. Some variants of the second-stage backdoors also come with features designed to look up file names in the Microso

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been linked to a cyber attack on a power generation company in southern Africa with a new variant of the SystemBC malware called DroxiDat as a precursor to a suspected ransomware attack. "The proxy-capable backdoor was deployed alongside Cobalt Strike Beacons in a south African nation's critical infrastructure," Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT),&nbsp; said . The Russian cybersecurity company said the attack, which took place in late March 2023, was in its early stages and involved the use of DroxiDat to profile the system and proxy network traffic using the&nbsp; SOCKS5 protocol &nbsp;to and from command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. SystemBC &nbsp;is a C/C++-based commodity malware and remote administrative tool that was&nbsp; first seen in 2019 . Its main feature is to set up&nbsp; SOCKS5 proxies &nbsp;on victim computers that can then be used by threat actors to tunnel malicious traffic associ

A set of 16 high-severity security flaws have been disclosed in the&nbsp; CODESYS V3 &nbsp;software development kit (SDK) that could result in remote code execution and denial-of-service under specific conditions, posing risks to operational technology (OT) environments. The flaws, tracked from CVE-2022-47378 through CVE-2022-47393 and dubbed&nbsp; CoDe16 , carry a CVSS score of 8.8 with the exception of CVE-2022-47391, which has a severity rating of 7.5. Twelve of the flaws are buffer overflow vulnerabilities. "Exploitation of the discovered vulnerabilities, which affect all versions of CODESYS V3 prior to version 3.5.19.0, could put operational technology (OT) infrastructure at risk of attacks, such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial-of-service (DoS)," Vladimir Tokarev of the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Community&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; added &nbsp;a recently patched security flaw in Microsoft's .NET and Visual Studio products to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38180 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.5), the high-severity flaw relates to a case denial-of-service (DoS) impacting .NET and Visual Studio. It was&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;by Microsoft as part of its August 2023 Patch Tuesday updates shipped earlier this week, tagging it with an "Exploitation More Likely" assessment. While exact details surrounding the nature of exploitation are unclear, the Windows maker has acknowledged the existence of a proof-of-concept (PoC) in its advisory. It also said that attacks leveraging the flaw can be pulled off without any additional privileges or user interaction. "Proof-of-concept exploit code is available, or an attack demonstration is not practical for most systems," the company

New Attack Alert: Freeze[.]rs Injector Weaponized for XWorm Malware Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-attack-alert-freezers-injector.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors are using a legitimate Rust-based injector called&nbsp; Freeze[.]rs &nbsp;to deploy a commodity malware called XWorm in victim environments. The novel attack chain, detected by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs on July 13, 2023, is initiated via a phishing email containing a booby-trapped PDF file. It has also been used to introduce Remcos RAT by means of a crypter called SYK Crypter, which was first documented by Morphisec in May 2022. "This file redirects to an HTML file and utilizes the 'search-ms' protocol to access an LNK file on a remote server," security researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . "Upon clicking the LNK file, a PowerShell script executes Freeze[.]rs and SYK Crypter for further offensive actions." Freeze[.]rs, released on May 4, 2023, is a&nbsp; open-source red teaming tool &nbsp;from Optiv that functions as a payload creation tool used for circumventing security solutions and executing shellcode in a stealthy manner.

Attackers continue to target Microsoft identities to gain access to connected Microsoft applications and federated SaaS applications.

The attacker group Nobelium, linked with the SolarWinds attacks, has been documented using native functionality like the creation of Federated Trusts&nbsp; [1] &nbsp;to enable persistent access to a Microsoft tenant. This article demonstrates an additional native functionality that when leveraged by an attacker enables persistent access to a Microsoft cloud tenant and lateral movement capabilities to another tenant. This attack vector enables an attacker operating in a compromised tenant to abuse a misconfigured Cross-Tenant Synchronization (CTS) configuration and gain access to other connected tenants or deploy a rogue CTS configuration to maintain persistence within the te

A widely used Chinese language input app for Windows and Android has been found vulnerable to serious security flaws that could allow a malicious interloper to decipher the text typed by users. The findings from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which carried out an analysis of the encryption mechanism used in Tencent's Sogou Input Method , an app that has over 455 million monthly active users across Windows, Android, and iOS. The vulnerabilities are rooted in EncryptWall, the service's custom encryption system, allowing network eavesdroppers to extract the textual content and access sensitive data. "The Windows and Android versions of Sogou Input Method contain vulnerabilities in this encryption system, including a vulnerability to a CBC&nbsp; padding oracle attack , which allow network eavesdroppers to recover the plaintext of encrypted network transmissions, revealing sensitive information including what users have typed," the researchers&nbsp; said .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are increasingly using a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit dubbed EvilProxy to pull off account takeover attacks aimed at high-ranking executives at prominent companies. According to Proofpoint, an ongoing hybrid campaign has leveraged the service to target thousands of Microsoft 365 user accounts, sending approximately 120,000 phishing emails to hundreds of organizations worldwide between March and June 2023. Nearly 39% of the hundreds of compromised users are said to be C-level executives, including CEOs (9%) and CFOs (17%). The attacks have also singled out personnel with access to financial assets or sensitive information. At least 35% of all compromised users had additional account protections enabled. The campaigns are seen as a response to the increased adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in enterprises, prompting threat actors to evolve their tactics to bypass new security layers by incorporating adversary-in-the-middle ( AitM ) phishing kits to

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Interpol has announced the takedown of a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform called 16Shop, in addition to the arrests of three individuals in Indonesia and Japan. 16Shop specialized in the sales of phishing kits that other cybercriminals can purchase to mount phishing attacks on a large scale, ultimately facilitating the theft of credentials and payment details from users of popular services such as Apple, PayPal, American Express, Amazon, and Cash App, among others. "Victims typically receive an email with a pdf file or link that redirects to a site requesting the victims' credit card or other personally identifiable information," Interpol&nbsp; said . "This information is then stolen and used to extract money from the victims." No less than 70,000 users across 43 countries are estimated to have been compromised via services offered on 16Shop. The law enforcement operation has also led to the arrest of the site's administrator, a 21-year-old Indonesian

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a trio of side-channel attacks that could be exploited to leak sensitive data from modern CPUs. Called&nbsp; Collide+Power &nbsp;( CVE-2023-20583 ),&nbsp; Downfall &nbsp;( CVE-2022-40982 ), and&nbsp; Inception &nbsp;( CVE-2023-20569 ), the novel methods follow the disclosure of another newly discovered security vulnerability affecting AMD's Zen 2 architecture-based processors known as&nbsp; Zenbleed &nbsp;(CVE-2023-20593). "Downfall attacks target a critical weakness found in billions of modern processors used in personal and cloud computers,"&nbsp; Daniel Moghimi , senior research scientist at Google,&nbsp; said . "This vulnerability [...] enables a user to access and steal data from other users who share the same computer." In a hypothetical attack scenario, a malicious app installed on a device could weaponize the method to steal sensitive information like passwords and encryption keys, effectively undermining Intel's Software Guard eXtensions ( SGX

Hackers associated with China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) have been linked to attacks in 17 different countries in Asia, Europe, and North America from 2021 to 2023. Cybersecurity firm Recorded Future attributed the intrusion set to a nation-state group it tracks under the name&nbsp; RedHotel &nbsp;(previously Threat Activity Group-22 or TAG-22), which overlaps with a cluster of activity broadly monitored as&nbsp; Aquatic Panda ,&nbsp; Bronze University , Charcoal Typhoon,&nbsp; Earth Lusca , and&nbsp; Red Scylla &nbsp;(or Red Dev 10). Active since 2019, some of the prominent sectors targeted by the prolific actor encompass academia, aerospace, government, media, telecommunications, and research. A majority of the victims during the period were government organizations.

Validate security continuously across your full stack with Pen Testing as a Service. In today's modern security operations center (SOC), it's a battle between the defenders and the cybercriminals. Both are using tools and expertise – however, the cybercriminals have the element of surprise on their side, and a host of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that have evolved. These external threat actors have now been further emboldened in the era of AI with open-source tools like ChatGPT. With the potential of an attack leading to a breach within minutes, CISOs now are looking to prepare all systems and assets for cyber resilience and rapid response when needed. With tools and capabilities to validate security continuously – including penetration testing as a service – DevSecOps teams can remediate critical vulnerabilities fast due to the easy access to tactical support to the teams that need it the most.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has introduced a new security feature in Android 14 that allows IT administrators to disable support for 2G cellular networks in their managed device fleet. The search giant said it's introducing a second user setting to turn off support, at the model level, for&nbsp; null-ciphered cellular connections . "The Android Security Model assumes that all networks are hostile to keep users safe from network packet injection, tampering, or eavesdropping on user traffic," Roger Piqueras Jover, Yomna Nasser, and Sudhi Herle&nbsp; said . "Android does not rely on link-layer encryption to address this threat model. Instead, Android establishes that all network traffic should be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)." 2G networks, in particular, employ weak encryption and lack mutual authentication,&nbsp; rendering &nbsp;them&nbsp; susceptible &nbsp;to over-the-air interception and traffic decryption attacks by impersonating a real 2G tower.

The U.K. Electoral Commission on Tuesday disclosed a "complex" cyber attack on its systems that went undetected for over a year, allowing the threat actors to access years worth of voter data belonging to 40 million people. "The incident was identified in October 2022 after suspicious activity was detected on our systems," the regulator&nbsp; said . "It became clear that hostile actors had first accessed the systems in August 2021." The intrusion enabled unauthorized access to the Commission's servers hosting email, control systems, and copies of the electoral registers it maintains for research purposes. The identity of the intruders are presently unknown. The registers included the name and address of anyone in the U.K. who registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, as well as the names of those registered as overseas voters. However, they did not contain information of those who qualified to register anonymously and addresses of overseas electors regi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Exposed Kubernetes (K8s) clusters are being exploited by malicious actors to deploy cryptocurrency miners and other backdoors. Cloud security firm Aqua, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News, said a majority of the clusters belonged to small to medium-sized organizations, with a smaller subset tied to bigger companies, spanning financial, aerospace, automotive, industrial, and security sectors. In total, Kubernetes clusters belonging to more than 350 organizations, open-source projects, and individuals were discovered, 60% of which were the target of an active crypto-mining campaign. The publicly-accessible clusters, per Aqua, are said to suffer from two different kinds of misconfigurations: allowing anonymous access with high privileges and running kubectl proxy with the flags "--address=`0.0.0.0` --accept-hosts `.*`" "Housing a wide array of sensitive and valuable assets, Kubernetes clusters can store customer data, financial records, intellectual property, a

Tactical similarities have been unearthed between the double extortion ransomware group known as Rhysida and Vice Society , including in their targeting of education and healthcare sectors. "As Vice Society was observed deploying a variety of commodity ransomware payloads, this link does not suggest that Rhysida is exclusively used by Vice Society, but shows with at least medium confidence that Vice Society operators are now using Rhysida ransomware," Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. Vice Society , tracked by Microsoft under the name Storm-0832, has a&nbsp; pattern &nbsp;of employing already existing ransomware binaries that are sold on criminal forums to pull off their attacks. The financially motivated gang has also been observed resorting to pure extortion-themed attacks wherein the data is exfiltrated without encrypting them. First observed in May 2023, the&nbsp; Rhysida &nbsp;ransomware group is known to rely on phishing attacks and Cobalt Strike to breach targets' networks and

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators associated with the QakBot (aka QBot) malware have set up 15 new command-and-control (C2) servers as of late June 2023. The findings are a continuation of the malware's infrastructure analysis from Team Cymru, and arrive a little over two months after Lumen Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that 25% of its C2 servers are only active for a single day. "QakBot has a history of taking an extended break each summer before returning sometime in September, with this year's spamming activities ceasing around 22 June 2023," the cybersecurity firm&nbsp; said . "But are the QakBot operators actually on vacation when they aren't spamming, or is this 'break' a time for them to refine and update their infrastructure and tools?" QakBot's C2 network, like in the case of Emotet and IcedID, is&nbsp; characterized &nbsp;by a tiered architecture in which C2 nodes communicate with upstream Tier 2 (T2) C2 nodes hosted on VPS providers geolocated in Russia.

Hackers Abusing Cloudflare Tunnels for Covert Communications<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/hackers-abusing-cloudflare-tunnels-for.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has revealed that threat actors are abusing Cloudflare Tunnels to establish covert communication channels from compromised hosts and retain persistent access. "Cloudflared is functionally very similar to ngrok," Nic Finn, a senior threat intelligence analyst at GuidePoint Security, said . "However, Cloudflared differs from ngrok in that it provides a lot more usability for free, including the ability to host TCP connectivity over cloudflared." A command-line tool for Cloudflare Tunnel, cloudflared allows users to create secure connections between an origin web server and Cloudflare's nearest data center so as to hide the web server IP addresses as well as block volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and brute-force login attacks. For a threat actor with elevated access on an infected host, this feature presents a lucrative approach to set up a foothold by generating a token required to establish the tunnel from the victim machine.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Introduced in 1999, Microsoft Active Directory is the default identity and access management service in Windows networks, responsible for assigning and enforcing security policies for all network endpoints. With it, users can access various resources across networks. As things tend to do, times, they are a'changin' – and a few years back, Microsoft introduced Azure Active Directory, the cloud-based version of AD to extend the AD paradigm, providing organizations with an Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solution across both the cloud and on-prem apps. (Note that as of July 11th 2023, this service was renamed to&nbsp; Microsoft Entra ID , but for the sake of simplicity, we'll refer to it as Azure AD in this post) Both Active Directory and Azure AD are critical to the functioning of on-prem, cloud-based, and hybrid ecosystems, playing a key role in uptime and business continuity.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor is using a variant of the Yashma ransomware to target various entities in English-speaking countries, Bulgaria, China, and Vietnam at least since June 4, 2023. Cisco Talos, in a new write-up, attributed the operation with moderate confidence to an adversary of likely Vietnamese origin. "The threat actor uses an uncommon technique to deliver the ransom note," security researcher Chetan Raghuprasad&nbsp; said . "Instead of embedding the ransom note strings in the binary, they download the ransom note from the actor-controlled GitHub repository by executing an embedded batch file." Yashma,&nbsp; first described &nbsp;by the BlackBerry research and intelligence team in May 2022, is a rebranded version of another ransomware strain called Chaos. A month prior to its emergence, the Chaos ransomware builder was leaked in the wild. A notable aspect of the ransom note is its resemblance to the well-known WannaCry ransomware, possibly done so in an attempt to obs

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a set of 11 living-off-the-land binaries-and-scripts ( LOLBAS ) that could be maliciously abused by threat actors to conduct post-exploitation activities.&nbsp; "LOLBAS is an attack method that uses binaries and scripts that are already part of the system for malicious purposes," Pentera security researcher Nir Chako&nbsp; said . "This makes it hard for security teams to distinguish between legitimate and malicious activities, since they are all performed by trusted system utilities." To that end, the Israeli cybersecurity company said it uncovered nine LOLBAS downloaders and three executors that could enable adversaries to download and execute "more robust malware" on infected hosts. This includes: MsoHtmEd.exe, Mspub.exe, ProtocolHandler.exe, ConfigSecurityPolicy.exe, InstallUtil.exe, Mshta.exe, Presentationhost.exe, Outlook.exe, MSAccess.exe, scp.exe, and sftp.exe.&nbsp; "In a complete attack chain, a hacker will us

New Malware Campaign Targets Inexperienced Cyber Criminals with OpenBullet Configs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-malware-campaign-targets.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware campaign has been observed making use of malicious OpenBullet configuration files to target inexperienced cyber criminals with the goal of delivering a remote access trojan (RAT) capable of stealing sensitive information. Bot mitigation company Kasada&nbsp; said &nbsp;the activity is designed to "exploit trusted criminal networks," describing it as an instance of advanced threat actors "preying on beginner hackers." OpenBullet &nbsp;is a legitimate&nbsp; open-source pen testing tool &nbsp;used for automating credential stuffing attacks. It takes in a&nbsp; configuration file &nbsp;that's tailored to a specific website and can combine it with a password list procured through other means to log successful attempts. "OpenBullet can be used with Puppeteer, which is a headless browser that can be used for automating web interactions," the company&nbsp; said . "This makes it very easy to launch credential stuffing attacks without having to deal with browser windows popping u

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two different North Korean nation-state actors have been linked to a cyber intrusion against the major Russian missile engineering company NPO Mashinostroyeniya. Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne&nbsp; said &nbsp;it identified "two instances of North Korea related compromise of sensitive internal IT infrastructure," including a case of an email server compromise and the deployment of a Windows backdoor dubbed OpenCarrot. The breach of the Linux email server has been attributed to&nbsp; ScarCruft . OpenCarrot, on the other hand, is a known implant&nbsp; previously identified &nbsp;as used by the Lazarus Group. The attacks were flagged in mid-May 2022. A rocket design bureau based in Reutov, NPO Mashinostroyeniya was&nbsp; sanctioned &nbsp;by the U.S. Treasury Department in July 2014 in&nbsp; connection &nbsp;to "Russia's continued attempts to destabilize eastern Ukraine and its ongoing occupation of Crimea."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In today's interconnected world, evolving security solutions to meet growing demand is more critical than ever. Collaboration across multiple solutions for intelligence gathering and information sharing is indispensable. The idea of multiple-source intelligence gathering stems from the concept that threats are rarely isolated. Hence, their detection and prevention require a comprehensive understanding of the broader landscape. A comprehensive and robust security framework should be established by aggregating resources, knowledge, and expertise from various sources. This collaborative effort allows for the analysis of diverse data sets, the identification of emerging patterns, and the timely dissemination of crucial information.&nbsp; In this article, we discuss a versatile security platform that can operate in two distinct roles within a security ecosystem. This platform can function as a subscriber, actively collecting and aggregating security data from various endpoints and other so

New 'Deep Learning Attack' Deciphers Laptop Keystrokes with 95% Accuracy<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-deep-learning-attack-deciphers.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics has devised a "deep learning-based acoustic side-channel attack" that can be used to classify laptop keystrokes that are recorded using a nearby phone with 95% accuracy. "When trained on keystrokes recorded using the video conferencing software Zoom, an accuracy of 93% was achieved, a new best for the medium," researchers Joshua Harrison, Ehsan Toreini, and Maryam Mehrnezhad&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new study published last week. Side-channel attacks&nbsp; refer &nbsp;to a class of&nbsp; security exploits &nbsp;that aim to glean insights from a system by monitoring and measuring its physical effects during the processing of sensitive data. Some of the common observable effects include runtime behavior, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, acoustics, and cache accesses. Although a completely side-channel-free implementation does not exist, practical attacks of this kind can have damaging consequences for user privacy and security as they could be weaponized by a ma

New SkidMap Linux Malware Variant Targeting Vulnerable Redis Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-skidmap-redis-malware-variant.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Vulnerable&nbsp; Redis services &nbsp;have been targeted by a "new, improved, dangerous" variant of a malware called SkidMap that's engineered to target a wide range of Linux distributions. "The malicious nature of this malware is to adapt to the system on which it is executed," Trustwave security researcher Radoslaw Zdonczyk&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. Some of the Linux distribution SkidMap sets its eyes on include Alibaba, Anolis, openEuler, EulerOS, Stream, CentOS, RedHat, and Rocky. SkidMap was&nbsp; first disclosed &nbsp;by Trend Micro in September 2019 as a cryptocurrency mining botnet with capabilities to load malicious kernel modules that can obfuscate its activities as well as monitor the miner process. The operators of the malware have also been found camouflaging their backup command-and-control (C2) IP address on the Bitcoin blockchain, evocative of another botnet malware known as&nbsp; Glupteba .

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is warning about cyber crooks masquerading as legitimate non-fungible token (NFT) developers to steal cryptocurrency and other digital assets from unsuspecting users. In these fraudulent schemes, criminals either obtain direct access to NFT developer social media accounts or create look-alike accounts to promote "exclusive" new NFT releases, often employing misleading advertising campaigns that create a sense of urgency to pull them off. "Links provided in these announcements are phishing links directing victims to a spoofed website that appears to be a legitimate extension of a particular NFT project," the FBI&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory last week. The replica websites urge potential targets to connect their cryptocurrency wallets and purchase the NFT, only for the threat actors to siphon the funds and NFTs to wallets under their control.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are using an open-source rootkit called&nbsp; Reptile &nbsp;to target Linux systems in South Korea. "Unlike other rootkit malware that typically only provide concealment capabilities, Reptile goes a step further by offering a reverse shell, allowing threat actors to easily take control of systems," the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. "Port knocking is a method where the malware opens a specific port on an infected system and goes on standby. When the threat actor sends a magic packet to the system, the received packet is used as a basis to establish a connection with the C&amp;C server." A rootkit is a malicious software program that's designed to provide privileged, root-level access to a machine while concealing its presence. At least four different campaigns have leveraged Reptile since 2022. The first use of the rootkit was&nbsp; recorded &nbsp;by Trend Micro in May 2022 in connection with an intrusion

Microsoft on Friday disclosed that it has addressed a critical security flaw impacting Power Platform , but not before it came under criticism for its failure to swiftly act on it. "The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to Custom Code functions used for Power Platform custom connectors," the tech giant&nbsp; said . "The potential impact could be unintended information disclosure if secrets or other sensitive information were embedded in the Custom Code function." The company further noted that no customer action is required and that it found no evidence of active exploitation of the vulnerability in the wild. Tenable, which initially discovered and reported the shortcoming to Redmond on March 30, 2023,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the problem could enable limited, unauthorized access to cross-tenant applications and sensitive data. The cybersecurity firm said the flaw arises as a result of insufficient access control to Azure Function hosts, leading to a scenario where a t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new high-severity security flaw in PaperCut print management software for Windows that could result in remote code execution under specific circumstances. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-39143 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.4), the flaw impacts PaperCut NG/MF prior to version 22.1.3. It has been described as a combination of a path traversal and file upload vulnerability. "CVE-2023-39143 enables unauthenticated attackers to potentially read, delete, and upload arbitrary files to the PaperCut MF/NG application server, resulting in remote code execution in certain configurations," Horizon3.ai's Naveen Sunkavally&nbsp; said . The cybersecurity firm said that file upload leading to remote code execution is possible when the external device integration setting is enabled, which is on by default in some installations of PaperCut. Earlier this April, another remote code execution vulnerability in the same product (CVE-2023-27350, CVSS score: 9.8) and an infor

A married couple from New York City has pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in connection with the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency stock exchange Bitfinex, resulting in the theft of about 120,000 bitcoin. The development comes more than a year after Ilya Lichtenstein, 35, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 33, were&nbsp; arrested in February 2022 , following the seizure of roughly 95,000 of the stolen crypto assets that were held by the defendants. The funds were valued at $3.6 billion at the time. Since then, the U.S. government said it has since seized another approximately $475 million tied to the breach. "Lichtenstein used a number of advanced hacking tools and techniques to gain access to Bitfinex's network," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)&nbsp; said . "Once inside their systems, Lichtenstein fraudulently authorized more than 2,000 transactions in which 119,754 bitcoin was transferred from Bitfinex to a cryptocurrency wallet in Lichtenstein's control."

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new bunch of malicious packages on the npm package registry that are designed to exfiltrate sensitive developer information. Software supply chain firm Phylum, which first identified the "test" packages on July 31, 2023, said they "demonstrated increasing functionality and refinement," hours after which they were removed and re-uploaded under different, legitimate-sounding package names. While the end goal of the undertaking is not clear, it's suspected to be a highly targeted campaign&nbsp; aimed at the cryptocurrency sector &nbsp;based on references to modules such as "rocketrefer" and "binarium." All the packages were published by the npm user malikrukd4732. A common feature across all the modules is the ability to launch JavaScript ("index.js") that's equipped to exfiltrate valuable information to a remote server.

A four-year-old critical security flaw impacting Fortinet FortiOS SSL has emerged as one of the most routinely and frequently exploited vulnerabilities in 2022.

The continued weaponization of&nbsp; CVE-2018-13379 , which was also one among the most exploited bugs in&nbsp; 2020 &nbsp;and&nbsp; 2021 , suggests a failure on the part of organizations to apply patches in a timely manner, the authorities said.

Malicious Apps Use Sneaky Versioning Technique to Bypass Google Play Store Scanners<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/malicious-apps-use-sneaky-versioning.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are leveraging a technique called versioning to evade Google Play Store's malware detections and target Android users. "Campaigns using versioning commonly target users' credentials, data, and finances," Google Cybersecurity Action Team (GCAT)&nbsp; s aid &nbsp;in its August 2023 Threat Horizons Report shared with The Hacker News. While versioning is not a new phenomenon, it's sneaky and hard to detect. In this method, a developer releases an initial version of an app on the Play Store that passes Google's pre-publication checks, but is later updated with a malware component. This is achieved by pushing an update from an attacker-controlled server to serve malicious code on the end user device using a method called dynamic code loading (DCL), effectively turning the app into a backdoor. Earlier this May, ESET&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;a screen recording app named "iRecorder - Screen Recorder" that remained innocuous for nearly a year after it was first

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new version of malware called&nbsp; Rilide &nbsp;that targets Chromium-based web browsers to steal sensitive data and steal cryptocurrency. "It exhibits a higher level of sophistication through modular design, code obfuscation, adoption to the&nbsp; Chrome Extension Manifest V3 , and additional features such as the ability to exfiltrate stolen data to a Telegram channel or interval-based screenshot captures," Trustwave security researcher Pawel Knapczyk&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. Rilide was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by the cybersecurity company in April 2023, uncovering two different attack chains that made use of Ekipa RAT and Aurora Stealer to deploy rogue browser extensions capable of data and crypto theft. It's sold on dark web forums by an actor named "friezer" for $5,000. The malware is equipped with a wide range of features that allow it to disable other browser add-ons, harvest browsing history and cookies,

Hundreds of Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway servers have been breached by malicious actors to deploy web shells, according to the Shadowserver Foundation. The non-profit&nbsp; said &nbsp;the attacks take advantage of&nbsp; CVE-2023-3519 , a critical code injection vulnerability that could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution.

The frequency and complexity of cyber threats are constantly evolving. At the same time, organizations are now collecting sensitive data that, if compromised, could result in severe financial and reputational damage.&nbsp; According to Cybersecurity Ventures , the cost of cybercrime is predicted to hit $8 trillion in 2023 and will grow to $10.5 trillion by 2025. There is also increasing public and regulatory scrutiny over data protection. Compliance regulations (such as PCI DSS and ISO 27001), as well as the need for a better understanding of your cybersecurity risks, are driving the need to conduct regular penetration tests.&nbsp; Pen testing helps to identify security flaws in your IT infrastructure before threat actors can detect and exploit them. This gives you visibility into the risks posed by potential attacks and enables you to take swift corrective action to address them. Here, we outline key factors to consider before, during, and post the penetration testing process. Pre-Penetrati

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A sophisticated Facebook phishing campaign has been observed exploiting a zero-day flaw in Salesforce's email services, allowing threat actors to craft targeted phishing messages using the company's domain and infrastructure. "Those phishing campaigns cleverly evade conventional detection methods by chaining the Salesforce vulnerability and legacy quirks in Facebook's Web Games platform," Guardio Labs researchers Oleg Zaytsev and Nati Tal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The email messages masquerade as coming from Meta, while being sent from an email address with a "@salesforce.com" domain. They seek to trick recipients into clicking on a link by claiming that their Facebook accounts are undergoing a "comprehensive investigation" due to "suspicions of engaging in impersonation." The goal is to direct users to a rogue landing page that's designed to capture the victim's account credentials and two-factor aut

Various European customers of different banks are being targeted by an Android banking trojan called&nbsp; SpyNote &nbsp;as part of an aggressive campaign detected in June and July 2023.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Data Security Posture Management is an approach to securing cloud data by ensuring that sensitive data always has the correct security posture - regardless of where it's been duplicated or moved to. So, what is DSPM? Here's a quick example: Let's say you've built an excellent&nbsp; security posture &nbsp;for your cloud data. For the sake of this example, your data is in production, it's protected behind a firewall, it's not publicly accessible, and your IAM controls have limited access properly. Now along comes a developer and replicates that data into a lower environment. What happens to that fine security posture you've built?&nbsp; Well, it's gone - and now the data is only protected by the security posture in that lower environment. So if that environment is exposed or improperly secured - so is all that sensitive data you've been trying to protect. Security postures just don't travel with their data .

Researchers Expose Space Pirates' Cyber Campaign Across Russia and Serbia<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/researchers-expose-space-pirate-cyber.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor known as&nbsp; Space Pirates &nbsp;has been linked to attacks against at least 16 organizations in Russia and Serbia over the past year by employing novel tactics and adding new cyber weapons to its arsenal. "The cybercriminals' main goals are still espionage and theft of confidential information, but the group has expanded its interests and the geography of its attacks," Positive Technologies&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep dive report published last week. Targets comprise government agencies, educational institutions, private security companies, aerospace manufacturers, agricultural producers, defense, energy, and healthcare firms in Russia and Serbia. Space Pirates was&nbsp; first exposed &nbsp;by the Russian cybersecurity company in May 2022, highlighting its attacks on the aerospace sector in the nation. The group, said to be active since at least late 2019, has links to another adversary tracked by Symantec as&nbsp; Webworm . Positive Technologies' analysis of the attack infrast

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A nation-state actor with links to China is suspected of being behind a series of attacks against industrial organizations in Eastern Europe that took place last year to siphon data stored on air-gapped systems. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky attributed the intrusions with medium to high confidence to a hacking crew called&nbsp; APT31 , which is also tracked under the monikers Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, and Violet Typhoon (formerly Zirconium), citing commonalities in the tactics observed. The attacks entailed the use of more than 15 distinct implants and their variants, broken down into three broad categories based on their ability to establish persistent remote access, gather sensitive information, and transmit the collected data to actor-controlled infrastructure. "One of the implant types appeared to be a sophisticated modular malware, aimed at profiling removable drives and contaminating them with a worm to exfiltrate data from isolated, or air-gapped, networks of indus

Organizations in Italy are the target of a new phishing campaign that leverages a new strain of malware called&nbsp; WikiLoader &nbsp;with an ultimate aim to install a banking trojan, stealer, and spyware referred to as&nbsp; Ursnif &nbsp;(aka Gozi). "It is a sophisticated downloader with the objective of installing a second malware payload," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. "The malware uses multiple mechanisms to evade detection and was likely developed as a malware that can be rented out to select cybercriminal threat actors." WikiLoader is so named due to the malware making a request to Wikipedia and checking that the response has the string "The Free." The enterprise security firm said it first detected the malware in the wild on December 27, 2022, in connection with an intrusion set mounted by a threat actor it tracks as&nbsp; TA544 , which is also known as Bamboo Spider and Zeus Panda.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The P2PInfect peer-to-peer (P2) worm has been observed employing previously undocumented initial access methods to breach susceptible Redis servers and rope them into a botnet. "The malware compromises exposed instances of the Redis data store by exploiting the replication feature," Cado Security researchers Nate Bill and Matt Muir&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "A common attack pattern against Redis in cloud environments is to exploit this feature using a malicious instance to enable replication. This is achieved via connecting to an exposed Redis instance and issuing the SLAVEOF command." The Rust-based malware was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, calling out the malware's ability to exploit a critical Lua sandbox escape vulnerability ( CVE-2022-0543 , CVSS score: 10.0) to obtain a foothold into Redis instances.

Threat actors associated with the hacking crew known as Patchwork have been spotted targeting universities and research organizations in China as part of a recently observed campaign. The activity, according to&nbsp; KnownSec 404 Team , entailed the use of a backdoor codenamed&nbsp; EyeShell . Patchwork , also known by the names Operation Hangover and Zinc Emerson, is suspected to be a threat group that operates on behalf of India. Active since at least December 2015, attack chains mounted by the outfit have a narrow focus and tend to single out Pakistan and China with custom implants such as BADNEWS via spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. The adversarial collective has been found to share tactical overlaps with other cyber-espionage groups with an Indian connection, including&nbsp; SideWinder &nbsp;and the&nbsp; DoNot Team .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Demand for Virtual CISO services is soaring. According to Gartner, the use of vCISO services among small and mid-size businesses and non-regulated enterprises was expected to grow by a whopping 1900% in just one year, from only 1% in 2021 to 20% in 2022! Offering vCISO services can be especially attractive for MSPs and MSSPs. By addressing their customers' needs for proactive cyber resilience, they can generate a growing amount of recurring revenue from existing and new customers. And all while differentiating themselves from the competition. vCISO services also enable upselling of additional products and services the MSP or MSSP specializes in. However, not all MSPs and MSSPs fully understand how to provide vCISO services . Some may be unsure about which services are expected from them. Others may not realize they are already providing vCISO services and have the potential to effortlessly broaden their offerings into a complete vCISO suite or package it differently to make it more

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Android malware strain called&nbsp; CherryBlos &nbsp;has been observed making use of optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to gather sensitive data stored in pictures. CherryBlos, per&nbsp; Trend Micro , is distributed via bogus posts on social media platforms and comes with capabilities to steal cryptocurrency wallet-related credentials and act as a&nbsp; clipper &nbsp;to substitute wallet addresses when a victim copies a string matching a predefined format is copied to the clipboard. Once installed, the apps seek users' permissions to grant it accessibility permissions, which allows it to automatically grant itself additional permissions as required. As a defense evasion measure, users attempting to kill or uninstall the app by entering the Settings app are redirected back to the home screen. Besides displaying fake overlays on top of legitimate crypto wallet apps to steal credentials and make fraudulent fund transfers to an attacker-controlled address, CherryBlos utilizes OCR to recog

Apple has announced plans to require developers to submit reasons to use certain APIs in their apps starting later this year with the release of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS Sonoma, tvOS 17, and watchOS 10 to prevent their abuse for data collection. "This will help ensure that apps only use these APIs for their intended purpose," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. "As part of this process, you'll need to select one or more approved reasons that accurately reflect how your app uses the API, and your app can only use the API for the reasons you've selected." The APIs that&nbsp; require &nbsp;reasons for use relate to the following - File timestamp APIs System boot time APIs Disk space APIs Active keyboard APIs, and User defaults APIs The iPhone maker said it's making the move to ensure that such APIs are not abused by app developers to collect device signals to carry out&nbsp; fingerprinting , which could be employed to&nbsp; uniquely identify users &nbsp;across different a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday disclosed details of a "novel persistent backdoor" called&nbsp; SUBMARINE &nbsp;deployed by threat actors in connection with the hack on Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances. "SUBMARINE comprises multiple artifacts — including a SQL trigger, shell scripts, and a loaded library for a Linux daemon — that together enable execution with root privileges, persistence, command and control, and cleanup," the agency&nbsp; said . The findings come from an analysis of malware samples obtained from an unnamed organization that had been compromised by threat actors exploiting a critical flaw in ESG devices,&nbsp; CVE-2023-2868 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), which allows for remote command injection. Evidence gathered so far shows that the attackers behind the activity, a suspected China nexus-actor tracked by Mandiant as&nbsp; UNC4841 , leveraged the flaw as a zero-day in October 2022 to gain initial access to victim envir

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ivanti has disclosed yet another security flaw impacting Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron Core, that it said has been weaponized as part of an exploit chain by malicious actors in the wild. The new vulnerability, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-35081 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), impacts supported versions 11.10, 11.9, and 11.8, as well as those that are currently end-of-life (EoL). "CVE-2023-35081 enables an authenticated administrator to perform arbitrary file writes to the EPMM server," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "This vulnerability can be used in conjunction with&nbsp; CVE-2023-35078 , bypassing administrator authentication and ACLs restrictions (if applicable)." A successful exploit could allow a threat actor to write arbitrary files on the appliance, thereby enabling the malicious party to execute OS commands on the appliance as the tomcat user.

IcedID Malware Adapts and Expands Threat with Updated BackConnect Module<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/icedid-malware-adapts-and-expands.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors linked to the malware loader known as IcedID have made updates to the BackConnect (BC) module that's used for post-compromise activity on hacked systems, new findings from Team Cymru reveal. IcedID, also called BokBot , is a strain of malware similar to&nbsp; Emotet &nbsp;and&nbsp; QakBot &nbsp;that started off as a banking trojan in 2017, before switching to the role of an initial access facilitator for other payloads. Recent versions of the malware have been&nbsp; observed &nbsp;removing functionality related to online banking fraud to prioritize ransomware delivery. The BackConnect (BC) module,&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Netresec in October 2022, relies on a proprietary command-and-control (C2) protocol to exchange commands between a server and the infected host. The protocol, which comes with a VNC component for remote access, has also been identified in other malware such as the now-discontinued&nbsp; BazarLoader &nbsp;and QakBot. In December 2022, Team Cymru&nbsp; reported &nbsp;the discovery of 11 BC C2s a

An ongoing cyber attack campaign has set its sights on Korean-speaking individuals by employing U.S. Military-themed document lures to trick them into running malware on compromised systems.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As part of&nbsp; Checkmarx's mission &nbsp;to help organizations develop and deploy secure software, the Security Research team started looking at the security posture of major car manufacturers. Porsche has a well-established Vulnerability Reporting Policy (Disclosure Policy) [1] , it was considered in scope for our research, so we decided to start there, and see what we could find. What we found is an attack scenario that results from chaining security issues found on different Porsche's assets, a website and a GraphQL API, that could lead to data exfiltration. Data exfiltration is an attack technique that can impact businesses and organizations, regardless of size. When malicious users breach a company's or organization's systems and exfiltrate data, it can be a jarring and business-critical moment. Porsche has a diverse online presence - deploying several microsites, websites, and web applications. The Porsche Experience [2] is one website that allows registered users to

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A legitimate Windows search feature is being exploited by malicious actors to download arbitrary payloads from remote servers and compromise targeted systems with remote access trojans such as AsyncRAT and Remcos RAT. The novel attack technique, per Trellix, takes advantage of the " search-ms: " URI protocol handler, which offers the ability for applications and HTML links to launch custom local searches on a device, and the " search: " application protocol, a mechanism for calling the desktop search application on Windows. "Attackers are directing users to websites that exploit the 'search-ms' functionality using JavaScript hosted on the page," security researchers Mathanraj Thangaraju and Sijo Jacob&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday write-up. "This technique has even been extended to HTML attachments, expanding the attack surface." In such attacks, threat actors have been observed creating deceptive emails that embed hyperlinks or&nbsp; HTML attachme

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Russian nation-state actor known as&nbsp; BlueBravo &nbsp;has been observed targeting diplomatic entities throughout Eastern Europe with the goal of delivering a new backdoor called GraphicalProton, exemplifying the continuous evolution of the threat. The phishing campaign is characterized by the use of legitimate internet services (LIS) for command-and-control (C2) obfuscation, Recorded Future said in a new report published Thursday. The activity was observed between March and May 2023. BlueBravo , also known by the names APT29, Cloaked Ursa, and Midnight Blizzard (formerly Nobelium), is attributed to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and has in the past&nbsp; used &nbsp;Dropbox, Firebase, Google Drive, Notion, and Trello to evade detection and stealthily establish communications with infected hosts. To that end, GraphicalProton is the latest addition to a long list of malware targeting diplomatic organizations after&nbsp; GraphicalNeutrino &nbsp;(aka SNOWYAMBER),&nbsp; HALFRIG, and QUARTERRIG .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Users of Metabase, a popular business intelligence and data visualization software package, are being advised to update to the latest version following the discovery of an "extremely severe" flaw that could result in pre-authenticated remote code execution on affected installations. Tracked as CVE-2023-38646 , the issue impacts open-source editions prior to 0.46.6.1 and Metabase Enterprise versions before 1.46.6.1. "An unauthenticated attacker can run arbitrary commands with the same privileges as the Metabase server on the server you are running Metabase on," Metabase said in an advisory released last week. The issue has also been addressed in the following older versions - 0.45.4.1 and 1.45.4.1 0.44.7.1 and 1.44.7.1, and 0.43.7.2 and 1.43.7.2 While there is no evidence that the issue has been exploited in the wild, data gathered by the Shadowserver Foundation shows that 5,488 out of the total 6,936 Metabase instances are vulnerable as of July 26, 202

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity agencies in Australia and the U.S. have&nbsp; published &nbsp;a joint cybersecurity advisory warning against security flaws in web applications that could be exploited by malicious actors to orchestrate data breach incidents and steal confidential data. This includes a specific class of bugs called Insecure Direct Object Reference ( IDOR ), a type of access control flaw that occurs when an application utilizes user-supplied input or an identifier for direct access to an internal resource, such as a database record, without any additional validations. A&nbsp; typical example &nbsp;of an IDOR flaw is the ability of a user to trivially change the URL (e.g., https://example[.]site/details.php?id= 12345 ) to obtain unauthorized data of another transaction (i.e., https://example[.]site/details.php?id= 67890 ).

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed two high-severity security flaws in the Ubuntu kernel that could pave the way for local privilege escalation attacks. Cloud security firm Wiz, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News, said the easy-to-exploit shortcomings have the potential to impact 40% of Ubuntu users. "The impacted Ubuntu versions are prevalent in the cloud as they serve as the default operating systems for multiple [cloud service providers]," security researchers Sagi Tzadik and Shir Tamari said. The&nbsp; vulnerabilities &nbsp;– tracked as CVE-2023-32629 and 2023-2640 (CVSS scores: 7.8) and dubbed&nbsp; GameOver(lay) &nbsp;– are present in a module called&nbsp; OverlayFS &nbsp;and arise as a result of inadequate permissions checks in certain scenarios, enabling a local attacker to gain elevated privileges.

A new malvertising campaign has been observed leveraging ads on Google Search and Bing to target users seeking IT tools like AnyDesk, Cisco AnyConnect VPN, and WinSCP, and trick them into downloading trojanized installers with an aim to breach enterprise networks and likely carry out future ransomware attacks.

Nitrogen was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by eSentire in June 2023, detailing an infection chain that redirects users to compromised WordPress sites hosting malicious ISO image files that ultimately culminate in the delivery of Python scripts and Cobalt Strike Beacons onto the targeted system. Then earlier this month, Trend Micro&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;a similar attack sequence in which a fraudulent WinSCP application functioned as a stepping stone for a BlackCat ransomware attack.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As cloud applications are built, tested and updated, they wind their way through an ever-complex series of different tools and teams. Across hundreds or even thousands of technologies that make up the patchwork quilt of development and cloud environments, security processes are all too often applied in only the final phases of software development.&nbsp; Placing security at the very end of the production pipeline puts both devs and security on the back foot. Developers want to build and ship secure apps; security teams want to support this process by strengthening application security. However, today's security processes are legacy approaches that once worked brilliantly for the tight constraints of on-prem production, but struggle in quasi-public, ever-shifting cloud environments. As a result, security is an afterthought, and any attempt to squeeze siloed security into agile SDLC can&nbsp; swell the cost of patching by 600% . A new cloud security operating model is long overdue. Shift-le

A city court in Moscow on Wednesday convicted Group-IB co-founder and CEO Ilya Sachkov of "high treason" and jailed him for 14 years in a "strict regime colony" over accusations of passing information to foreign spies. "The court found Sachkov guilty under Article 275 of the Russian Criminal Code (high treason) sentencing him to 14 years of incarceration in a maximum-security jail, restriction of freedom for one year and a fine of 500,000 rubles (about $5,550)," state news agency TASS&nbsp; reported . Sachkov, who has been in custody&nbsp; since September 2021 &nbsp;and denied wrongdoing, had been accused of handing over classified information to foreign intelligence in 2011, which the prosecutors said caused reputational damage to Russia's national interests. The exact nature of the charges is unclear.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday approved new rules that require publicly traded companies to publicize details of a cyber attack within four days of identifying that it has a "material" impact on their finances, marking a major shift in how computer breaches are disclosed. "Whether a company loses a factory in a fire — or millions of files in a cybersecurity incident — it may be material to investors," SEC chair Gary Gensler&nbsp; said . "Currently, many public companies provide cybersecurity disclosure to investors. I think companies and investors alike, however, would benefit if this disclosure were made in a more consistent, comparable, and decision-useful way." To that end, the new obligations mandate that companies reveal the incident's nature, scope, and timing, as well as its impact. This disclosure, however, may be delayed by an additional period of up to 60 days should it be determined that giving out such specific

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A deeper analysis of a recently discovered malware called&nbsp; Decoy Dog &nbsp;has revealed that it's a significant upgrade over the&nbsp; Pupy RAT , an open-source remote access trojan it's modeled on. "Decoy Dog has a full suite of powerful, previously unknown capabilities – including the ability to move victims to another controller, allowing them to maintain communication with compromised machines and remain hidden for long periods of time," Infoblox&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. "Some victims have actively communicated with a Decoy Dog server for over a year." Other new features allow the malware to execute arbitrary Java code on the client and connect to emergency controllers using a mechanism that's similar to a traditional DNS domain generation algorithm ( DGA ), with the Decoy Dog domains engineered to respond to replayed DNS queries from breached clients. The sophisticated toolkit was&nbsp; first discovered &nbsp;by the cybersecurity firm in early April 2023 after

A new study conducted by Uptycs has uncovered a stark increase in the distribution of information stealing (a.k.a. infostealer or stealer) malware. Incidents have more than doubled in Q1 2023, indicating an alarming trend that threatens global organizations. According to the new Uptycs' whitepaper,&nbsp; Stealers are Organization Killers , a variety of new info stealers have emerged this year, preying on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. Telegram has notably been used extensively by these malware authors for command, control, and data exfiltration. What is a Stealer? A stealer is a type of malware that targets its victim by stealing sensitive information that can include passwords, login credentials, and other personal data. After collecting such data, the stealer sends it to the threat actor's command and control (C2) system. RedLine and Vidar, two well-known stealers, took advantage of log-providing services to infiltrate private systems. RedLine primarily targets credenti

Tax-paying individuals in Mexico and Chile have been targeted by a Mexico-based cybercrime group that goes by the name&nbsp; Fenix &nbsp;to breach targeted networks and steal valuable data. A key hallmark of the operation entails cloning official portals of the Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT) in Mexico and the Servicio de Impuestos Internos (SII) in Chile and redirecting potential victims to those sites.&nbsp; "These fake websites prompt users to download a supposed security tool, claiming it will enhance their portal navigation safety," Metabase Q security researchers Gerardo Corona and Julio Vidal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a recent analysis. "However, unbeknownst to the victims, this download actually installs the initial stage of malware, ultimately enabling the theft of sensitive information such as credentials."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A severe privilege escalation issue impacting MikroTik RouterOS could be weaponized by remote malicious actors to execute arbitrary code and seize full control of vulnerable devices. Cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-30799 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.1), the shortcoming is expected to put approximately 500,000 and 900,000 RouterOS systems at risk of exploitation via their web and/or Winbox interfaces, respectively, VulnCheck disclosed in a Tuesday report. "CVE-2023-30799 does require authentication," security researcher Jacob Baines&nbsp; said . "In fact, the vulnerability itself is a simple privilege escalation from admin to 'super-admin' which results in access to an arbitrary function. Acquiring credentials to RouterOS systems is easier than one might expect." This is because the Mikrotik RouterOS operating system does not offer any protection against password brute-force attacks and ships with a well-known default "admin" user, with its password being an empty string

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
North Korean nation-state actors affiliated with the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) have been attributed to the&nbsp; JumpCloud hack &nbsp;following an operational security (OPSEC) blunder that exposed their actual IP address. Google-owned threat intelligence firm Mandiant attributed the activity to a threat actor it tracks under the name UNC4899, which likely shares overlaps with clusters already being monitored as Jade Sleet and TraderTraitor, a group with a history of striking blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. UNC4899 also overlaps with&nbsp; APT43 , another hacking crew associated with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) that was unmasked earlier this March as conducting a series of campaigns to gather intelligence and siphon cryptocurrency from targeted companies. The adversarial collective's modus operandi is characterized by the use of Operational Relay Boxes ( ORBs ) using L2TP IPsec tunnels along with commercial VPN providers to disguise the attacker's

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The financially motivated threat actors behind the&nbsp; Casbaneiro &nbsp;banking malware family have been observed making use of a User Account Control ( UAC ) bypass technique to gain full administrative privileges on a machine, a sign that the threat actor is evolving their tactics to avoid detection and execute malicious code on compromised assets. "They are still heavily focused on Latin American financial institutions, but the changes in their techniques represent a significant risk to multi-regional financial organizations as well," Sygnia&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement shared with The Hacker News. Casbaneiro , also known as Metamorfo and Ponteiro, is best known for its banking trojan, which first emerged in mass email spam campaigns targeting the Latin American financial sector in 2018. Infection chains typically begin with a phishing email pointing to a booby-trapped attachment that, when launched, activates a series of steps that culminate in the deployment of the banking malware

As the number of people using macOS keeps going up, so does the desire of hackers to take advantage of flaws in Apple's operating system.&nbsp; What Are the Rising Threats to macOS? There is a common misconception among macOS fans that Apple devices are immune to hacking and malware infection. However, users have been facing more and more dangers recently. Inventive attackers are specifically targeting Mac systems, as seen with the "Geacon" Cobalt Strike tool attack. This tool enables them to perform malicious actions such as data theft, privilege elevation, and remote device control, placing the security and privacy of Mac users at grave risk. Earlier this year, researchers also uncovered the MacStealer malware, which also stole sensitive data from Apple users. Documents, iCloud keychain data, browser cookies, credit card credentials – nothing is safe from the prying eyes.&nbsp; But that's not all.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A set of five security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the Terrestrial Trunked Radio ( TETRA ) standard for radio communication used widely by government entities and critical infrastructure sectors, including what's believed to be an intentional backdoor that could have potentially exposed sensitive information. The issues, discovered by Midnight Blue in 2021 and held back until now, have been collectively called&nbsp; TETRA:BURST . There is no conclusive evidence to determine that the vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild to date. "Depending on infrastructure and device configurations, these vulnerabilities allow for real time decryption, harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks, message injection, user deanonymization, or session key pinning," the Netherlands-based cybersecurity company&nbsp; said . Standardized by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in 1995, TETRA is used in more than 100 countries and as a police radio communication system

How do you overcome today's talent gap in cybersecurity? This is a crucial issue — particularly when you find executive leadership or the board asking pointed questions about your security team's ability to defend the organization against new and current threats. This is why many security leaders find themselves turning to managed security services like MDR ( managed detection and response ), which can offer an immediate solution. The right MDR partner can act as an extension of your existing team, while offering a fast and budget-friendly option for uplevelling security at organizations of virtually any size. Here's a look at common staffing challenges that MDR helps solve: Overcoming Cybersecurity Talent Challenges From stopping ransomware to securing the attack surface of the environment, most security teams have more to do than they can manage.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new security vulnerability has been discovered in AMD's Zen 2 architecture-based processors that could be exploited to extract sensitive data such as encryption keys and passwords. Discovered by Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy, the flaw – codenamed&nbsp; Zenbleed &nbsp;and tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-20593 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.5) – allows data exfiltration at the rate of 30 kb per core, per second. The issue is part of a broader category of weaknesses called&nbsp; speculative execution attacks , in which the optimization technique widely used in modern CPUs is abused to access cryptographic keys from CPU registers. "Under specific microarchitectural circumstances, a register in 'Zen 2' CPUs may not be written to 0 correctly," AMD&nbsp; explained &nbsp;in an advisory. "This may cause data from another process and/or thread to be stored in the YMM register , which may allow an attacker to potentially access sensitive information."

Apple has&nbsp; rolled out security updates &nbsp;to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and Safari to address several security vulnerabilities, including one actively exploited zero-day bug in the wild. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38606 , the shortcoming resides in the kernel and permits a malicious app to modify sensitive kernel state potentially. The company said it was addressed with improved state management. "Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited against versions of iOS released before iOS 15.7.1," the tech giant noted in its advisory. It's worth noting that CVE-2023-38606 is the third security vulnerability discovered in connection with&nbsp; Operation Triangulation , a sophisticated mobile cyber espionage campaign targeting iOS devices since 2019 using a zero-click exploit chain. The other two zero-days,&nbsp; CVE-2023-32434 and CVE-2023-32435 , were patched by Apple last month. Kaspersky researchers Valentin Pashkov, Mikhail Vinogradov, Georgy Kuc

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows Installers for the Atera remote monitoring and management software could act as a springboard to launch privilege escalation attacks. The flaws, discovered by Mandiant on February 28, 2023, have been assigned the identifiers&nbsp; CVE-2023-26077 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-26078 , with the issues remediated in versions 1.8.3.7 and 1.8.4.9 released by Atera on April 17, 2023, and June 26, 2023, respectively. "The ability to initiate an operation from a NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context can present potential security risks if not properly managed," security researcher Andrew Oliveau&nbsp; said . "For instance, misconfigured&nbsp; Custom Actions &nbsp;running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM can be exploited by attackers to execute local privilege escalation attacks." Successful exploitation of such weaknesses could pave the way for the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

Google has announced that it intends to add support for Message Layer Security ( MLS ) to its Messages service for Android and open source implementation of the specification.

The healthcare industry is under a constant barrage of cyberattacks. It has traditionally been one of the most frequently targeted industries, and things haven't changed in 2023. The U.S. Government's Office for Civil Rights reported&nbsp; 145 data breaches &nbsp;in the United States during the first quarter of this year. That follows 707 incidents a year ago, during which over 50 million records were stolen. Health records often include names, birth dates, social security numbers, and addresses. This treasure trove of data is used in identity theft, tax fraud, and other crimes. It is the high value of the data that makes healthcare applications such a promising target. The healthcare industry was hesitant to adopt SaaS applications. However, SaaS applications lead to better collaboration among medical professionals, leading to improved patient outcomes. That, combined with SaaS's ability to reduce costs and improve financial performance, has led to the industry fully embracing SaaS solutions

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a now-patched flaw in OpenSSH that could be potentially exploited to run arbitrary commands remotely on compromised hosts under specific conditions. "This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable OpenSSH's forwarded ssh-agent," Saeed Abbasi, manager of vulnerability research at Qualys,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis last week. The vulnerability is being tracked under the CVE identifier&nbsp; CVE-2023-38408 &nbsp;(CVSS score: N/A). It impacts all versions of OpenSSH before&nbsp; 9.3p2 . OpenSSH is a popular connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol that's used for encrypting all traffic to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. Successful exploitation requires the presence of certain libraries on the victim system and that the SSH authentication agent is&nbsp; forwarded &nbsp;to an attacker-controlled system. SSH agent is a&nbsp; background program &nbsp;that maintains users' keys

Cybersecurity researchers said they have discovered what they say is the first open-source software supply chain attacks specifically targeting the banking sector. "These attacks showcased advanced techniques, including targeting specific components in web assets of the victim bank by attaching malicious functionalities to it," Checkmarx&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "The attackers employed deceptive tactics such as creating a fake LinkedIn profile to appear credible and customized command-and-control (C2) centers for each target, exploiting legitimate services for illicit activities." The npm packages have since been reported and taken down. The names of the packages were not disclosed. In the first attack, the malware author is said to have uploaded a couple of packages to the npm registry in early April 2023 by posing as an employee of the target bank. The modules came with a preinstall script to activate the infection sequence. To complete the rus

The recent attack against&nbsp; Microsoft's email infrastructure &nbsp;by a Chinese nation-state actor referred to as Storm-0558 is said to have a broader scope than previously thought. According to cloud security company Wiz, the inactive Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key used to forge Azure Active Directory (Azure AD or AAD) tokens to gain illicit access to Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Outlook.com could also have allowed the adversary to forge access tokens for various types of Azure AD applications. This&nbsp; includes &nbsp;every application that supports personal account authentication, such as OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams; customers applications that support the "Login with Microsoft functionality," and multi-tenant applications in certain conditions.

Regardless of the country, local government is essential in most citizens' lives. It provides many day-to-day services and handles various issues. Therefore, their effects can be far-reaching and deeply felt when security failures occur. In early 2023, Oakland, California, &nbsp;fell victim to a ransomware attack . Although city officials have not disclosed how the attack occurred, experts suspect a phishing email is the most likely cause. As a result, city officials brought down their servers to contain the attack. Governments have been the target to many ransomware attacks &nbsp;and breaches. As most local governments maintain a small IT staff, there is potential for shared passwords, reused credentials, and a lack of multi-factor authentication security, exposing vulnerabilities for a breach.&nbsp; Oakland is Breached It was first noticed on a Wednesday evening in early February; when Oakland, California city officials quickly took most services' backend servers offline and posted a m

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Several distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnets have been observed exploiting a critical flaw in Zyxel devices that came to light in April 2023 to gain remote control of vulnerable systems. "Through the capture of exploit traffic, the attacker's IP address was identified, and it was determined that the attacks were occurring in multiple regions, including Central America, North America, East Asia, and South Asia," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . The flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-28771 (CVSS score: 9.8), is a command injection bug affecting multiple firewall models that could potentially allow an unauthorized actor to execute arbitrary code by sending a specifically crafted packet to the targeted appliance. Last month, the Shadowserver Foundation&nbsp; warned &nbsp;that the flaw was being "actively exploited to build a Mirai-like botnet" at least since May 26, 2023, an indication of how abuse of&nbsp; servers running unpatched software &nbsp;is on the rise.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an advisory on Thursday warning that the newly disclosed critical security flaw in Citrix NetScaler Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Gateway devices is being abused to drop web shells on vulnerable systems. "In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day to drop a web shell on a critical infrastructure organization's non-production environment NetScaler ADC appliance," the agency&nbsp; said . "The web shell enabled the actors to perform discovery on the victim's active directory (AD) and collect and exfiltrate AD data. The actors attempted to move laterally to a domain controller but network segmentation controls for the appliance blocked movement." The shortcoming in question is&nbsp; CVE-2023-3519 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), a code injection bug that could result in unauthenticated remote code execution. Citrix, earlier this week, released patches for the issue and

Two more security flaws have been disclosed in AMI MegaRAC Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) software that, if successfully exploited, could allow threat actors to remotely commandeer vulnerable servers and deploy malware. "These new vulnerabilities range in severity from High to Critical, including unauthenticated remote code execution and unauthorized device access with superuser permissions," Eclypsium researchers Vlad Babkin and Scott Scheferman said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "They can be exploited by remote attackers having access to Redfish remote management interfaces, or from a compromised host operating system." To make matters worse, the shortcomings could also be weaponized to drop persistent firmware implants that are immune to operating system reinstalls and hard drive replacements, brick motherboard components, cause physical damage through overvolting attacks, and induce indefinite reboot loops.

Mallox ransomware activities in 2023 have witnessed a 174% increase when compared to the previous year, new findings from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 reveal. "Mallox ransomware, like many other ransomware threat actors, follows the double extortion trend: stealing data before encrypting an organization's files, and then threatening to publish the stolen data on a leak site as leverage to convince victims to pay the ransom fee," security researchers Lior Rochberger and Shimi Cohen&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report shared with The Hacker News. Mallox is linked to a threat actor that's also linked to&nbsp; other ransomware strains , such as TargetCompany, Tohnichi, Fargo, and, most recently, Xollam. It first burst onto the scene in June 2021. Some of the prominent sectors targeted by Mallox are manufacturing, professional and legal services, and wholesale and retail. A notable aspect of the group is its pattern of exploiting poorly secured MS-SQL servers via&nbsp; dictionary attacks &nbsp;as

Multiple security flaws have been disclosed in Apache OpenMeetings, a web conferencing solution, that could be potentially exploited by malicious actors to seize control of admin accounts and run malicious code on susceptible servers. "Attackers can bring the application into an unexpected state, which allows them to take over any user account, including the admin account," Sonar vulnerability researcher Stefan Schiller&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.

If it seems like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) has been around forever, it's because it has (at least compared to the many technologies that rise and fall within just a few years.) The initial version, known as "Remote Desktop Protocol 4.0," was released in 1996 as part of the Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server edition and allowed users to remotely access and control Windows-based computers over a network connection.&nbsp; In the intervening decades, RDP has become a widely used protocol for remote access and administration of Windows-based systems. RDP plays a crucial role in enabling remote work, IT support, and system management and has served as the foundation for various remote desktop and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solutions.&nbsp; The downside of RDP's widespread use is that a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in an RDP gateway can have severe consequences, potentially leading to significant damage and compromising the security and integrity of the affec

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new cloud targeting, peer-to-peer (P2P) worm called&nbsp; P2PInfect &nbsp;that targets vulnerable Redis instances for follow-on exploitation. "P2PInfect exploits Redis servers running on both Linux and Windows Operating Systems making it more scalable and potent than other worms," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers William Gamazo and Nathaniel Quist&nbsp; said .

The first known instance of P2PInfect was detected on July 11, 2023. A notable characteristic of the worm is its ability to infects vulnerable Redis instances by exploiting a critical Lua sandbox escape vulnerability,&nbsp; CVE-2022-0543 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 10.0), which has been previously exploited to deliver multiple&nbsp; malware families &nbsp;such as&nbsp; Muhstik ,&nbsp; Redigo , and&nbsp; HeadCrab &nbsp;over the past ye

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Attack surfaces are growing faster than security teams can keep up. To stay ahead, you need to know what's exposed and where attackers are most likely to strike. With cloud migration dramatically increasing the number of internal and external targets, prioritizing threats and managing your attack surface from an attacker's perspective has never been more important. Let's look at why it's growing, and how to monitor and manage it properly with tools like&nbsp; Intruder . What is your attack surface? First, it's important to understand that your attack surface is the sum of your digital assets that are 'exposed' – whether the digital assets are secure or vulnerable, known or unknown, in active use or not. This attack surface changes continuously over time, and includes digital assets that are on-premises, in the cloud, in subsidiary networks, and in third-party environments. In short, it's anything that a hacker can attack.&nbsp; What is attack surface managemen

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have&nbsp; released &nbsp;a set of recommendations to address security concerns with 5G standalone network slicing and harden them against possible threats. "The threat landscape in 5G is dynamic; due to this, advanced monitoring, auditing, and other analytical capabilities are required to meet certain levels of network slicing service level requirements over time," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Security Agency (NSA)&nbsp; said . 5G is the fifth-generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, offering increased data speeds and lower latency. Network slicing is an architectural model that allows mobile service providers to partition their network up into several independent "slices" in order to create virtual networks that cater to different clients and use cases. The latest advisory builds upon guidance&nbsp; previously issued &nbsp;by the agencies in December 2022, warning

APT41, also tracked under the names Axiom, Blackfly, Brass Typhoon (formerly Barium), Bronze Atlas, HOODOO, Wicked Panda, and Winnti, is known to be operational since at least 2007, targeting a wide range of industries to conduct intellectual property theft.

On April 5, 2023, the FBI and Dutch National Police&nbsp; announced the takedown of Genesis Market , one of the largest dark web marketplaces.

You can read the FBI's warrant&nbsp; here &nbsp;for details specific to this case. In light of these events, I'd like to discuss how OSINT can assist with dark web investigations. The Dark Web's anonymity attracts a variety of users, from whistleblowers and political activists to cybercriminals and terrorists. There are several techniques that can be used to try and identify the individuals behind these sites and personas. Technical Vulnerabilities While not considered OSINT, there have been instances when technical vulnerabilities have existed in the technology used to host dark websites.

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a privilege escalation vulnerability in Google Cloud that could enable malicious actors tamper with application images and infect users, leading to supply chain attacks. The issue, dubbed&nbsp; Bad.Build , is rooted in the&nbsp; Google Cloud Build service , according to cloud security firm Orca, which discovered and reported the issue. "By abusing the flaw and enabling an impersonation of the default Cloud Build service, attackers can manipulate images in the Google Artifact Registry and inject malicious code," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement shared with The Hacker News. "Any applications built from the manipulated images are then affected and, if the malformed applications are meant to be deployed on customer's environments, the risk crosses from the supplying organization's environment to their customers' environments, constituting a major supply chain risk."

An unidentified threat actor compromised an application used by multiple entities in Pakistan to deliver&nbsp; ShadowPad , a successor to the PlugX backdoor that's commonly associated with&nbsp; Chinese hacking crews . Targets included a Pakistan government entity, a public sector bank, and a telecommunications provider, according to Trend Micro. The infections took place between mid-February 2022 and September 2022. The cybersecurity company said the incident could be the result of a supply-chain attack, in which a legitimate piece of software used by targets of interest is trojanized to deploy malware capable of gathering sensitive information from compromised systems. The attack chain takes the form of a malicious installer for&nbsp; E-Office , an application developed by the National Information Technology Board (NITB) of Pakistan to help government departments go paperless.

Data associated with a subset of registered customers of VirusTotal, including their names and email addresses, were exposed after an employee inadvertently uploaded the information to the malware scanning platform. The security incident, which comprises a database of 5,600 names in a 313KB file, was first disclosed by&nbsp; Der Spiegel &nbsp;and&nbsp; Der Standard &nbsp;yesterday. Launched in 2004, VirusTotal is a popular service that analyzes suspicious files and URLs to detect types of malware and malicious content using antivirus engines and website scanners. It was acquired by Google in 2012 and became a subsidiary of Google Cloud's Chronicle unit in 2018. When reached for comment, Google confirmed the leak and said it took immediate steps to remove the data. "We are aware of the unintentional distribution of a small segment of customer group administrator emails and organization names by one of our employees on the VirusTotal platform," a Google Cloud spokesperson told The Hacker

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The financially motivated threat actor known as FIN8 has been observed using a "revamped" version of a backdoor called&nbsp; Sardonic &nbsp;to deliver the&nbsp; BlackCat ransomware . According to the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, the development is an attempt on the part of the e-crime group to diversify its focus and maximize profits from infected entities. The intrusion attempt took place in December 2022. FIN8 is being tracked by the cybersecurity company under the name Syssphinx. Known to be active since at least 2016, the adversary was originally attributed to attacks targeting point-of-sale (PoS) systems using malware such as PUNCHTRACK and BADHATCH. The group resurfaced after more than a year in March 2021 with an updated version of BADHATCH, following it up with a completely new bespoke implant called Sardonic , which was disclosed by Bitdefender in August 2021.

Conor Brian Fitzpatrick , the owner of the now-defunct BreachForums website, has pleaded guilty to charges related to his operation of the cybercrime forum as well as having child pornography images. The development,&nbsp; first reported &nbsp;by DataBreaches.net last week, comes nearly four months after Fitzpatrick (aka pompompurin) was&nbsp; formally charged &nbsp;in the U.S. with conspiracy to commit access device fraud and possession of child pornography. BreachForums, launched in March 2022, operated as an illegal marketplace that allowed its members to trade hacked or stolen databases, enabling other criminal actors to gain unauthorized access to target systems. It was shut down in March 2023 shortly after&nbsp; Fitzpatrick's arrest &nbsp;in New York. As many as 888 databases consisting of 14 billion individual records are estimated to have been found in total. The forum had over 333,000 members prior to its takedown.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are actively exploiting a recently disclosed critical security flaw in the WooCommerce Payments WordPress plugin as part of a massive targeted campaign. The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-28121 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), is a case of authentication bypass that enables unauthenticated attackers to impersonate arbitrary users and perform some actions as the impersonated user, including an administrator, potentially leading to site takeover. "Large-scale attacks against the vulnerability, assigned CVE-2023-28121, began on Thursday, July 14, 2023 and continued over the weekend, peaking at 1.3 million attacks against 157,000 sites on Saturday, July 16, 2023," Wordfence security researcher Ram Gall&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday post. Versions 4.8.0 through 5.6.1 of WooCommerce Payments are vulnerable. The plugin is installed on over 600,000 sites. Patches for the bug were released by WooCommerce back in March 2023, with WordPress issuing auto-updates to sites using affected versions of

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A little over a week after&nbsp; JumpCloud reset API keys of customers &nbsp;impacted by a security incident, the company said the intrusion was the work of a sophisticated nation-state actor. The adversary "gained unauthorized access to our systems to target a small and specific set of our customers," Bob Phan, chief information security officer (CISO) at JumpCloud,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post-mortem report. "The attack vector used by the threat actor has been mitigated." The U.S. enterprise software firm said it identified anomalous activity on June 27, 2023, on an internal orchestration system, which it traced back to a spear-phishing campaign mounted by the attacker on June 22. While JumpCloud said it took security steps to shield its network by rotating credentials and rebuilding its systems, it wasn't until July 5 when it detected "unusual activity" in the commands framework for a small set of customers, prompting a forced-rotation of all admin API keys.

Threat actors are taking advantage of Android's&nbsp; WebAPK technology &nbsp;to trick unsuspecting users into installing malicious web apps on Android phones that are designed to capture sensitive personal information.

The application impersonates PKO Bank Polski, a multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in Warsaw. Details of the campaign were&nbsp; first shared &nbsp;by Polish cybersecurity firm RIFFSEC.

Cybercriminals Exploit Microsoft Word Vulnerabilities to Deploy LokiBot Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/cybercriminals-exploit-microsoft-word.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft Word documents exploiting known remote code execution flaws are being used as phishing lures to drop malware called&nbsp; LokiBot &nbsp;on compromised systems. "LokiBot, also known as Loki PWS, has been a well-known information-stealing Trojan active since 2015," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . "It primarily targets Windows systems and aims to gather sensitive information from infected machines." The cybersecurity company, which spotted the campaign in May 2023, said the attacks take advantage of&nbsp; CVE-2021-40444 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2022-30190 &nbsp;(aka Follina) to achieve code execution. The Word file that weaponizes CVE-2021-40444 contains an external GoFile link embedded within an XML file that leads to the download of an HTML file, which exploits Follina to download a next-stage payload, an injector module written in Visual Basic that decrypts and launches LokiBot. The injector also features evasion techniques to check for the presence of debuggers a

The Russia-linked threat actor known as Gamaredon has been observed conducting data exfiltration activities within an hour of the initial compromise. "As a vector of primary compromise, for the most part, emails and messages in messengers (Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal) are used, in most cases, using previously compromised accounts," the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis of the group published last week. Gamaredon , also called Aqua Blizzard, Armageddon, Shuckworm, or UAC-0010, is a&nbsp; state-sponsored actor &nbsp;with ties to the SBU Main Office in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. The group is estimated to have infected thousands of government computers. It is also one of the&nbsp; many Russian hacking crews &nbsp;that have maintained an&nbsp; active presence &nbsp;since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war in February 2022, leveraging phishing campaigns to deliver PowerShell backdoors such as GammaSteel to conduct recon

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
With generative artificial intelligence (AI) becoming all the rage these days, it's perhaps not surprising that the technology has been repurposed by malicious actors to their own advantage, enabling avenues for accelerated cybercrime. According to findings from SlashNext, a new generative AI cybercrime tool called&nbsp; WormGPT &nbsp;has been advertised on underground forums as a way for adversaries to launch sophisticated phishing and business email compromise ( BEC ) attacks. "This tool presents itself as a blackhat alternative to GPT models, designed specifically for malicious activities," security researcher Daniel Kelley&nbsp; said . "Cybercriminals can use such technology to automate the creation of highly convincing fake emails, personalized to the recipient, thus increasing the chances of success for the attack." The author of the software has described it as the "biggest enemy of the well-known ChatGPT" that "lets you do all sorts of illegal stuff.

Microsoft on Friday said a validation error in its source code allowed for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tokens to be forged by a malicious actor known as&nbsp; Storm-0558 &nbsp;using a Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key to breach two dozen organizations. "Storm-0558 acquired an inactive MSA consumer signing key and used it to forge authentication tokens for Azure AD enterprise and MSA consumer to access OWA and Outlook.com," the tech giant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deeper analysis of the campaign. "The method by which the actor acquired the key is a matter of ongoing investigation." "Though the key was intended only for MSA accounts, a validation issue allowed this key to be trusted for signing Azure AD tokens. This issue has been corrected." It's not immediately clear if the token validation issue was exploited as a "zero-day vulnerability" or if Microsoft was already aware of the problem before it came under in-the-wild abuse.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in various services, including Honeywell Experion distributed control system (DCS) and QuickBlox, that, if successfully exploited, could result in severe compromise of affected systems. Dubbed Crit.IX, the nine flaws in the Honeywell Experion DCS platform allow for "unauthorized remote code execution, which means an attacker would have the power to take over the devices and alter the operation of the DCS controller, whilst also hiding the alterations from the engineering workstation that manages the controller," Armis said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. Put differently, the issues relate to lack of encryption and adequate authentication mechanisms in a proprietary protocol called Control Data Access (CDA) that's used to communicate between Experion Servers and C300 controllers, effectively enabling a threat actor to take over the devices and alter the operation of the DCS controller.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As security practices continue to evolve, one primary concern persists in the minds of security professionals—the risk of employees unintentionally or deliberately exposing vital information. Insider threats, whether originating from deliberate actions or accidental incidents, pose a significant challenge to safeguarding sensitive data. To effectively address insider risks, organizations must adopt a holistic approach that encompasses technical, procedural, and human elements. While access controls, encryption, and monitoring systems are crucial for identifying and mitigating unauthorized access and suspicious activities, the increasing prevalence of cloud-based environments and the surge in SaaS application usage demand a fresh perspective on Insider Risk Management from a SaaS security standpoint. Stay ahead of the game by embracing the SaaS security lens. Join us for an enlightening webinar where we will demonstrate how security practitioners can proactively adapt their approach

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
All-In-One Security (AIOS), a WordPress plugin installed on over one million sites, has issued a security update after a bug introduced in version 5.1.9 of the software caused users' passwords being added to the database in plaintext format. "A malicious site administrator (i.e. a user already logged into the site as an admin) could then have read them," UpdraftPlus, the maintainers of AIOS,&nbsp; said . "This would be a problem if those site administrators were to try out those passwords on other services where your users might have used the same password. If those other services' logins are not protected by two-factor authentication, this could be a risk to the affected website." The issue surfaced nearly three weeks ago when a user of the plugin&nbsp; reported &nbsp;the behavior, stating they were "absolutely shocked that a security plugin is making such a basic security 101 error." AIOS also noted that the updates remove the existing logged data from th

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious actor has been linked to a cloud credential stealing campaign in June 2023 that's focused on Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, marking the adversary's expansion in targeting beyond Amazon Web Services (AWS). The findings come from&nbsp; SentinelOne &nbsp;and&nbsp; Permiso , which said the "campaigns share similarity with tools attributed to the notorious TeamTNT cryptojacking crew," although it emphasized that "attribution remains challenging with script-based tools." They also overlap with an ongoing TeamTNT campaign&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by Aqua called Silentbob that leverages misconfigured cloud services to drop malware as part of what's said to be a testing effort, while also linking&nbsp; SCARLETEEL &nbsp;attacks to the threat actor, citing infrastructure commonalities.

A new malware strain has been found covertly targeting small office/home office (SOHO) routers for more than two years, infiltrating over 70,000 devices and creating a botnet with 40,000 nodes spanning 20 countries. Lumen Black Lotus Labs has dubbed the malware&nbsp; AVrecon , making it the third such strain to focus on SOHO routers after&nbsp; ZuoRAT &nbsp;and&nbsp; HiatusRAT &nbsp;over the past year. "This makes AVrecon one of the largest SOHO router-targeting botnets ever seen," the company&nbsp; said . "The purpose of the campaign appears to be the creation of a covert network to quietly enable a range of criminal activities from password spraying to digital advertising fraud." A majority of the infections are located in the U.K. and the U.S., followed by Argentina, Nigeria, Brazil, Italy, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Russia, and South Africa, among others. AVrecon was&nbsp; first highlighted &nbsp;by Kaspersky senior security researcher Ye (Seth) Jin in May 2021, indicating that the malware has

Government entities, military organizations, and civilian users in Ukraine and Poland have been targeted as part of a series of campaigns designed to steal sensitive data and gain persistent remote access to the infected systems. The intrusion set, which stretches from April 2022 to July 2023, leverages phishing lures and decoy documents to deploy a downloader malware called PicassoLoader, which acts as a conduit to launch Cobalt Strike Beacon and njRAT. "The attacks used a multistage infection chain initiated with malicious Microsoft Office documents, most commonly using Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint file formats," Cisco Talos researcher Vanja Svajcer&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "This was followed by an executable downloader and payload concealed in an image file, likely to make its detection more difficult."

In a sign that cybersecurity researchers continue to be under the radar of malicious actors, a proof-of-concept (PoC) has been discovered on GitHub, concealing a backdoor with a "crafty" persistence method. "In this instance, the PoC is a wolf in sheep's clothing, harboring malicious intent under the guise of a harmless learning tool," Uptycs researchers Nischay Hegde and Siddartha Malladi&nbsp; said .

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has alerted of two security flaws impacting Rockwell Automation ControlLogix EtherNet/IP (ENIP) communication module models that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution and denial-of-service (DoS). "The results and impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities vary depending on the ControlLogix system configuration, but they could lead to denial or loss of control, denial or loss of view, theft of operational data, or manipulation of control for disruptive or destructive consequences on the industrial process for which the ControlLogix system is responsible," Draogos&nbsp; said . The list of flaws is as follows - CVE-2023-3595 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8) - An out-of-bounds write flaw impacting 1756 EN2* and 1756 EN3* products that could result in arbitrary code execution with persistence on the target system through maliciously crafted common industrial protocol ( CIP ) messages.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unnamed Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agency in the U.S. detected anomalous email activity in mid-June 2023, leading to Microsoft's discovery of a new China-linked&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;targeting two dozen organizations. The details come from a joint cybersecurity advisory released by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on July 12, 2023. "In June 2023, a Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agency identified suspicious activity in their Microsoft 365 (M365) cloud environment," the authorities&nbsp; said . "Microsoft determined that advanced persistent threat (APT) actors accessed and exfiltrated unclassified Exchange Online Outlook data." While the name of the government agency was not revealed,&nbsp; CNN &nbsp;and&nbsp; the Washington Post &nbsp;reported it was the U.S. State Department, citing people familiar with the matter.

Ransomware has emerged as the only cryptocurrency-based crime to grow in 2023, with cybercriminals extorting nearly $175.8 million more than they did a year ago, according to findings from Chainalysis. "Ransomware attackers are on pace for their second-biggest year ever, having extorted at least $449.1 million through June," the blockchain analytics firm&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a midyear crypto crime report shared with The Hacker News. "If this pace continues, ransomware attackers will extort $898.6 million from victims in 2023, trailing only 2021's $939.9 million." In contrast, crypto scams have pulled in 77% less revenue than they did through June of 2022, largely driven by the abrupt exit of&nbsp; VidiLook , which pays users VDL tokens in return for watching digital ads that then can be exchanged for large rewards.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Tuesday&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that it repelled a cyber attack staged by a Chinese nation-state actor targeting two dozen organizations, some of which include government agencies, in a cyber espionage campaign designed to acquire confidential data. The attacks, which commenced on May 15, 2023, entailed access to email accounts affecting approximately 25 entities and a small number of related individual consumer accounts. The tech giant attributed the campaign to Storm-0558, describing it as a nation-state activity group based out of China that primarily singles out government agencies in Western Europe. "They focus on espionage, data theft, and credential access," Microsoft&nbsp; said . "They are also known to use custom malware that Microsoft tracks as Cigril and Bling, for credential access." The breach is said to have been detected a month later on June 16, 2023, after an unidentified customer reported the anomalous email activity to the company. Microsoft sai

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a novel rootkit signed by Microsoft that's engineered to communicate with an actor-controlled attack infrastructure. Trend Micro has attributed the activity cluster to the same actor that was previously identified as behind the&nbsp; FiveSys rootkit , which came to light in October 2021. "This malicious actor originates from China and their main victims are the gaming sector in China," Trend Micro's Mahmoud Zohdy, Sherif Magdy, and Mohamed Fahmy&nbsp; said . Their malware seems to have passed through the Windows Hardware Quality Labs ( WHQL ) process for getting a valid signature. Multiple variants of the rootkit spanning eight different clusters have been discovered, with 75 such drivers signed using Microsoft's WHQL program in 2022 and 2023. Trend Micro's analysis of some of the samples has revealed the presence of debug messages in the source code, indicating that the operation is still in the development and testing phas

Python-Based PyLoose Fileless Attack Targets Cloud Workloads for Cryptocurrency Mining<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/python-based-pyloose-fileless-attack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new fileless attack dubbed&nbsp; PyLoose &nbsp;has been observed striking cloud workloads with the goal of delivering a cryptocurrency miner, new findings from Wiz reveal. "The attack consists of Python code that loads an XMRig Miner directly into memory using&nbsp; memfd , a known Linux fileless technique," security researchers Avigayil Mechtinger, Oren Ofer, and Itamar Gilad&nbsp; said . "This is the first publicly documented Python-based fileless attack targeting cloud workloads in the wild." The cloud security firm said it found nearly 200 instances where the attack method was employed for cryptocurrency mining. No other details about the threat actor are currently known other than the fact that they possess sophisticated capabilities.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Microsoft Windows policy loophole has been observed being exploited primarily by native Chinese-speaking threat actors to forge signatures on kernel-mode drivers. "Actors are leveraging multiple open-source tools that alter the signing date of kernel mode drivers to load malicious and unverified drivers signed with expired certificates," Cisco Talos said in an&nbsp; exhaustive two-part report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News. "This is a major threat, as access to the kernel provides complete access to a system, and therefore total compromise." Following responsible disclosure, Microsoft&nbsp; said &nbsp;it has taken steps to block all certificates to mitigate the threat. It further stated that its investigation found "the activity was limited to the abuse of several developer program accounts and that no Microsoft account compromise has been identified."

MITRE ATT&amp;CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a widely adopted framework and knowledge base that outlines and categorizes the&nbsp; tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in cyberattacks . Created by the nonprofit organization MITRE, this framework provides security professionals with insights and context that can help them comprehend, identify, and mitigate cyber threats effectively. The techniques and tactics in the framework are organized in a dynamic matrix. This makes navigation easy and also provides a holistic view of the entire spectrum of adversary behaviors. As a result, the framework is more actionable and usable than if it were a static list. The MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework can be found here:&nbsp; https://attack.mitre.org/ Look Out: MI

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud environments continue to be at the receiving end of an ongoing advanced attack campaign dubbed SCARLETEEL, with the threat actors now setting their sights on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Fargate. "Cloud environments are still their primary target, but the tools and techniques used have adapted to bypass new security measures, along with a more resilient and stealthy command and control architecture," Sysdig security researcher Alessandro Brucato said in a new report shared with The Hacker News. SCARLETEEL was&nbsp; first exposed &nbsp;by the cybersecurity company in February 2023, detailing a sophisticated attack chain that culminated in the theft of proprietary data from AWS infrastructure and the deployment of cryptocurrency miners to profit off the compromised systems' resources illegally. A follow-up analysis by Cado Security&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;potential links to a prolific cryptojacking group known as&nbsp; TeamTNT , although Sysdig told The Hacker News that it "could be some

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A developing piece of ransomware called&nbsp; Big Head &nbsp;is being distributed as part of a malvertising campaign that takes the form of bogus Microsoft Windows updates and Word installers. Big Head was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs last month, when it discovered multiple variants of the ransomware that are designed to encrypt files on victims' machines in exchange for a cryptocurrency payment. "One Big Head ransomware variant displays a fake Windows Update, potentially indicating that the ransomware was also distributed as a fake Windows Update," Fortinet researchers said at the time. "One of the variants has a Microsoft Word icon and was likely distributed as counterfeit software." A majority of the Big Head samples have been submitted so far from the U.S., Spain, France, and Turkey. In a new analysis of the .NET-based ransomware, Trend Micro detailed its inner workings, calling out its ability to deploy three encrypted binaries: 1.exe to propag

Apple has released&nbsp; Rapid Security Response &nbsp;updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Safari web browser to&nbsp; address &nbsp;a zero-day flaw that it said has been actively exploited in the wild. The WebKit bug, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-37450 , could allow threat actors to achieve arbitrary code execution when processing specially crafted web content. The iPhone maker said it addressed the issue with improved checks. Credited with discovering and reporting the flaw is an anonymous researcher. As with most cases like this, there are scant details about the nature and the scale of the attacks and the identity of the threat actor behind them. But Apple noted in a terse advisory that it's "aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited." The updates, iOS 16.5.1 (a), iPadOS 16.5.1 (a), macOS Ventura 13.4.1 (a), and Safari 16.5.2, are available for devices running the following operating system versions: iOS 16.5.1 and iPadOS 16.5.1 macOS Ventura 13.4.1 macOS Big

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Businesses operating in the Latin American (LATAM) region are the target of a new Windows-based banking trojan called&nbsp; TOITOIN &nbsp;since May 2023. "This sophisticated campaign employs a trojan that follows a multi-staged infection chain, utilizing specially crafted modules throughout each stage," Zscaler researchers Niraj Shivtarkar and Preet Kamal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "These modules are custom designed to carry out malicious activities, such as injecting harmful code into remote processes, circumventing User Account Control via COM Elevation Moniker, and evading detection by Sandboxes through clever techniques like system reboots and parent process checks." The six-stage endeavor has all the hallmarks of a well-crafted attack sequence, beginning with a phishing email containing an embedded link that points to a ZIP archive hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance to evade domain-based detections. The email messages leverage an invoice-themed lure to t

Global Retailers Must Keep an Eye on Their SaaS Stack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/global-retailers-must-keep-eye-on-their.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Brick-and-mortar retailers and e-commerce sellers may be locked in a fierce battle for market share, but one area both can agree on is the need to secure their SaaS stack. From communications tools to order management and fulfillment systems, much of today's critical retail software lives in SaaS apps in the cloud. Securing those applications is crucial to ongoing operations, chain management, and business continuity.&nbsp; Breaches in retail send out seismic shockwaves. Ten years later, many still remember one national retailer that had 40 million credit card records stolen. Those attacks have continued. According to&nbsp; Verizon's &nbsp;Data Breach Investigations Report, last year saw 629 cybersecurity incidents in the sector. Clearly, retailers must take concrete steps to secure their SaaS stack.&nbsp; And yet, securing applications is complicated. Retailers tend to have multiple tenants of apps, which leads to confusion over which instances of the application were already secured and whic

The threat actors behind the RomCom RAT have been suspected of phishing attacks targeting the&nbsp; upcoming NATO Summit &nbsp;in Vilnius as well as an identified organization supporting Ukraine abroad. The findings come from the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team, which&nbsp; found &nbsp;two malicious documents submitted from a Hungarian IP address on July 4, 2023. RomCom, also tracked under the names Tropical Scorpius, UNC2596, and Void Rabisu, was recently observed staging cyber attacks against politicians in Ukraine who are working closely with Western countries and a U.S.-based healthcare organization involved with aiding refugees fleeing the war-torn country. Attack chains mounted by the group are geopolitically motivated and have employed spear-phishing emails to point victims to cloned websites hosting trojanized versions of popular software. Targets include militaries, food supply chains, and IT companies. The latest lure documents identified by BlackBerry impersonate Ukrainia

Hackers Steal $20 Million by Exploiting Flaw in Revolut's Payment Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/hackers-steal-20-million-by-exploiting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors exploited an unknown flaw in Revolut's payment systems to steal more than $20 million of the company's funds in early 2022. The development was&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by the Financial Times, citing multiple unnamed sources with knowledge of the incident. The breach has not been disclosed publicly. The fault stemmed from discrepancies between Revolut's U.S. and European systems, causing funds to be erroneously refunded using its own money when some transactions were declined. The problem was first detected in late 2021. But before it could be closed, the report said organized criminal groups leveraged the loophole by "encouraging individuals to try to make expensive purchases that would go on to be declined." The refunded amounts would then be withdrawn from ATMs. The exact technical details associated with the flaw are currently unclear. About $23 million was stolen in total, with some funds recovered by pursuing those who had withdrawn cash. The mass

Two file management apps on the Google Play Store have been discovered to be spyware, putting the privacy and security of up to 1.5 million Android users at risk. These apps engage in deceptive behaviour and secretly send sensitive user data to malicious servers in China. Pradeo, a leading mobile security company, has uncovered this alarming infiltration. The report shows that both spyware apps, namely File Recovery and Data Recovery (com.spot.music.filedate) with over 1 million installs, and File Manager (com.file.box.master.gkd) with over 500,000 installs, are developed by the same group. These seemingly harmless Android apps use similar malicious tactics and automatically launch when the device reboots without user input. Contrary to what they claim on the Google Play Store, where both apps assure users that no data is collected, Pradeo's analytics engine has found that various personal information is collected without users' knowledge. Stolen data includes contact list

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have issued a warning about an emerging and advanced form of voice phishing ( vishing ) known as " Letscall ." This technique is currently targeting individuals in South Korea. The criminals behind "Letscall" employ a multi-step attack to deceive victims into downloading malicious apps from a counterfeit Google Play Store website. Once the malicious software is installed, it redirects incoming calls to a call center under the control of the criminals. Trained operators posing as bank employees then extract sensitive information from unsuspecting victims. To facilitate the routing of voice traffic, "Letscall" utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as voice over IP (VOIP) and WebRTC. It also makes use of Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) and Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) protocols, including Google STUN servers, to ensure high-quality phone or video calls and bypass NAT and firewall restrictions.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Progress Software has announced the discovery and patching of a critical SQL injection vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer, popular software used for secure file transfer. In addition, Progress Software has patched two other high-severity vulnerabilities. The identified SQL injection vulnerability, tagged as CVE-2023-36934 , could potentially allow unauthenticated attackers to gain unauthorized access to the MOVEit Transfer database. SQL injection vulnerabilities are a well-known and dangerous security flaw that allows attackers to manipulate databases and run any code they want. Attackers can send specifically designed payloads to certain endpoints of the affected application, which could change or expose sensitive data in the database. The reason CVE-2023-36934 is so critical is that it can be exploited without having to be logged in. This means that even attackers without valid credentials can potentially exploit the vulnerability. However, as of now, there have been no reports of

Mastodon, a popular decentralized social network, has released a security update to fix critical vulnerabilities that could expose millions of users to potential attacks. Mastodon is known for its federated model, consisting of thousands of separate servers called "instances," and it has over 14 million users across more than 20,000 instances. The most critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-36460 , allows hackers to exploit a flaw in the media attachments feature, creating and overwriting files in any location the software could access on an instance. This software vulnerability could be used for DoS and arbitrary remote code execution attacks, posing a significant threat to users and the broader Internet ecosystem. If an attacker gains control over multiple instances, they could cause harm by instructing users to download malicious applications or even bring down the entire Mastodon infrastructure. Fortunately, there is no evidence of this vulnerability being exploited so fa

CISOs, security leaders, and SOC teams often struggle with limited visibility into all connections made to their company-owned assets and networks. They are hindered by a lack of open-source intelligence and powerful technology required for proactive, continuous, and effective discovery and protection of their systems, data, and assets. As advanced threat actors constantly search for easily exploitable vulnerabilities around the clock, CISOs are in pursuit of improved methods to reduce threat exposures and safeguard their assets, users, and data from relentless cyber-attacks and the severe consequences of breaches. In response to this need, an emerging solution addressing the most critical priorities at the initial stage of the attack chain has provided security leaders with a new tool to manage their most pressing threat exposures at their origin.

Ransomware attacks are a major problem for organizations everywhere, and the severity of this problem continues to intensify. Recently, Microsoft's Incident Response team investigated the BlackByte 2.0 ransomware attacks and exposed these cyber strikes' terrifying velocity and damaging nature. The findings indicate that hackers can complete the entire attack process, from gaining initial access to causing significant damage, in just five days. They waste no time infiltrating systems, encrypting important data, and demanding a ransom to release it. This shortened timeline poses a significant challenge for organizations trying to protect themselves against these harmful operations. BlackByte ransomware is used in the final stage of the attack, using an 8-digit number key to encrypt the data. To carry out these attacks, hackers use a powerful combination of tools and techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a newly identified security flaw in the Linux kernel that could allow a user to gain elevated privileges on a target host. Dubbed&nbsp; StackRot &nbsp;( CVE-2023-3269 , CVSS score: 7.8), the flaw impacts Linux versions 6.1 through 6.4. There is no evidence that the shortcoming has been exploited in the wild to date. "As StackRot is a Linux kernel vulnerability found in the memory management subsystem, it affects almost all kernel configurations and requires minimal capabilities to trigger," Peking University security researcher Ruihan Li&nbsp; said . "However, it should be noted that maple nodes are freed using RCU callbacks, delaying the actual memory deallocation until after the RCU grace period. Consequently, exploiting this vulnerability is considered challenging." Following&nbsp; responsible disclosure &nbsp;on June 15, 2023, it has been&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;in stable versions 6.1.37, 6.3.11, and 6.4.1 as of July 1, 2023, after a two-week effort led by Linus Tor

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As technology advances and organizations become more reliant on data, the risks associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks also increase. The introduction of data privacy laws, such as the GDPR, has made it mandatory for organizations to disclose breaches of personal data to those affected. As such, it has become essential for businesses to protect themselves from the financial and reputational costs of cyber incidents. One solution to help organizations protect themselves is cyber insurance, despite the rising costs of cyber insurance, where the average&nbsp; price in the U.S. rose 79% &nbsp;in the second quarter of 2022. Also, with strict eligibility requirements that have emerged in response to risk and sharp spikes in successful breaches during and post-COVID-19, cyber insurance remains essential for organizations to protect sensitive customer information and their own data from falling into the wrong hands. While cyber insurance is not a one-size-fits-all solution and may not cover

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed an attack infrastructure that's being used as part of a "potentially massive campaign" against cloud-native environments. "This infrastructure is in early stages of testing and deployment, and is mainly consistent of an aggressive cloud worm, designed to deploy on exposed JupyterLab and Docker APIs in order to deploy&nbsp; Tsunami malware , cloud credentials hijack, resource hijack, and further infestation of the worm," cloud security firm Aqua&nbsp; said . The activity, dubbed&nbsp; Silentbob &nbsp;in reference to an AnonDNS domain set up by the attacker, is said to be linked to the infamous cryptojacking group tracked as&nbsp; TeamTNT , citing overlaps in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). However, the involvement of an "advanced copycat" hasn't been ruled out.

A suspected senior member of a French-speaking hacking crew known as OPERA1ER has been arrested as part of an international law enforcement operation codenamed Nervone, Interpol has announced.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A sophisticated stealer-as-a-ransomware threat dubbed&nbsp; RedEnergy &nbsp;has been spotted in the wild targeting energy utilities, oil, gas, telecom, and machinery sectors in Brazil and the Philippines through their LinkedIn pages. The malware "possesses the ability to steal information from various browsers, enabling the exfiltration of sensitive data, while also incorporating different modules for carrying out ransomware activities," Zscaler researchers Shatak Jain and Gurkirat Singh&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a recent analysis. The goal, the researchers noted, is to couple data theft with encryption with the goal of inflicting maximum damage to the victims. The starting point for the multi-stage attack is a&nbsp; FakeUpdates &nbsp;(aka SocGholish) campaign that tricks users into downloading JavaScript-based malware under the guise of web browser updates. What makes it novel is the use of reputable LinkedIn pages to target victims, redirecting users clicking on the website URLs to a bogus landing page

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Secrets are meant to be hidden or, at the very least, only known to a specific and limited set of individuals (or systems). Otherwise, they aren't really secrets. In personal life, a secret revealed can damage relationships, lead to social stigma, or, at the very least, be embarrassing. In a developer's or application security engineer's professional life, the consequences of exposing secrets can lead to breaches of security, data leaks, and, well, also be embarrassing. And while there are tools available for detecting source code and code repositories, there are few options for identifying secrets in plain text, documents, emails, chat logs, content management systems, and more. What Are Secrets? In the context of applications, secrets are sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, cryptographic keys, and other confidential data that an application needs to function but should not be exposed to unauthorized users.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The npm registry for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment is susceptible to what's called a&nbsp; manifest confusion &nbsp;attack that could potentially allow threat actors to conceal malware in project dependencies or perform arbitrary script execution during installation. "A npm package's manifest is published independently from its tarball," Darcy Clarke, a former GitHub and npm engineering manager,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published last week. "Manifests are never fully validated against the tarball's contents." "The ecosystem has broadly assumed the contents of the manifest and tarball are consistent," Clarke added. The problem, at its core, stems from the fact that the manifest and package metadata are decoupled and that they are never cross-referenced against one another, thereby leading to unexpected behavior and misuse when there is a mismatch. As a result, a threat actor could exploit this loophole to publish a module with a ma

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Swedish data protection watchdog has warned companies against using Google Analytics due to risks posed by U.S. government surveillance, following similar moves by&nbsp; Austria, France , and&nbsp; Italy &nbsp;last year. The development comes in the aftermath of an audit initiated by the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) against four companies CDON, Coop, Dagens Industri, and Tele2. "In its audits, IMY considers that the data transferred to the U.S. via Google's statistics tool is personal data because the data can be linked with other unique data that is transferred," IMY&nbsp; said . "The authority also concludes that the technical security measures that the companies have taken are not sufficient to ensure a level of protection that essentially corresponds to that guaranteed within the EU/EEA." The data protection authority also fined $1.1 million for Swedish telecom service provider Tele2 and less than $30,000 for local online marketplace CDON failing to

The threat actors behind the&nbsp; DDoSia &nbsp;attack tool have come up with a new version that incorporates a new mechanism to retrieve the list of targets to be bombarded with junk HTTP requests in an attempt to bring them down. The updated variant, written in Golang, "implements an additional security mechanism to conceal the list of targets, which is transmitted from the [command-and-control] to the users," cybersecurity company Sekoia&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up. DDoSia is attributed to a pro-Russian hacker group called&nbsp; NoName(057)16 . Launched in 2022 and a successor of the&nbsp; Bobik botnet , the attack tool is&nbsp; designed &nbsp;for staging distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets primarily located in Europe as well as Australia, Canada, and Japan.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An e-crime actor of Mexican provenance has been linked to an Android mobile malware campaign targeting financial institutions globally, but with a specific focus on Spanish and Chilean banks, from June 2021 to April 2023. The activity is being attributed to an actor codenamed&nbsp; Neo_Net , according to security researcher Pol Thill. The findings were published by SentinelOne following a Malware Research Challenge in collaboration with vx-underground. "Despite using relatively unsophisticated tools, Neo_Net has achieved a high success rate by tailoring their infrastructure to specific targets, resulting in the theft of over 350,000 EUR from victims' bank accounts and compromising Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of thousands of victims," Thill&nbsp; said . Some of the major targets include banks such as Santander, BBVA, CaixaBank, Deutsche Bank, Crédit Agricole, and ING.

No less than 330,000 FortiGate firewalls are still unpatched and vulnerable to CVE-2023-27997, a critical security flaw affecting Fortinet devices that has come under active exploitation in the wild. Cybersecurity firm Bishop Fox, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;published last week, said that out of nearly 490,000 Fortinet SSL-VPN interfaces exposed on the internet, about 69 percent remain unpatched. CVE-2023-27997 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), also called XORtigate, is a critical vulnerability impacting Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy SSL-VPN appliances that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands via specifically crafted requests. Patches were released by Fortinet last month in versions 6.0.17, 6.2.15, 6.4.13, 7.0.12, and 7.2.5, although the company&nbsp; acknowledged &nbsp;that the flaw may have been "exploited in a limited number of cases" in attacks targeting government, manufacturing, and critical infrastructure sectors.

A Chinese nation-state group has been observed targeting Foreign Affairs ministries and embassies in Europe using&nbsp; HTML smuggling techniques &nbsp;to deliver the PlugX remote access trojan on compromised systems. Cybersecurity firm Check Point said the activity, dubbed&nbsp; SmugX , has been ongoing since at least December 2022. "The campaign uses new delivery methods to deploy (most notably – HTML Smuggling) a new variant of PlugX, an implant commonly associated with a wide variety of Chinese threat actors," Check Point&nbsp; said . "Although the payload itself remains similar to the one found in older PlugX variants, its delivery methods result in low detection rates, which until recently helped the campaign fly under the radar." The exact identity of the threat actor behind the operation is a little hazy, although existing clues point in the direction of&nbsp; Mustang Panda , which also shares overlaps with clusters tracked as Earth Preta, RedDelta, and Check Point's own d

In yet another sign of a lucrative crimeware-as-a-service ( CaaS ) ecosystem, cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new Windows-based information stealer called&nbsp; Meduza Stealer &nbsp;that's actively being developed by its author to evade detection by software solutions. "The Meduza Stealer has a singular objective: comprehensive data theft," Uptycs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "It pilfers users' browsing activities, extracting a wide array of browser-related data." "From critical login credentials to the valuable record of browsing history and meticulously curated bookmarks, no digital artifact is safe. Even crypto wallet extensions, password managers, and 2FA extensions are vulnerable." Despite the similarity in features, Meduza boasts of a "crafty" operational design that eschews the use of obfuscation techniques and promptly terminates its execution on compromised hosts should a connection to the attacker's server fail. It's

BlackCat Operators Distributing Ransomware Disguised as WinSCP via Malvertising<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/blackcat-operators-distributing.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the&nbsp; BlackCat ransomware &nbsp;have been observed employing malvertising tricks to distribute rogue installers of the WinSCP file transfer application. "Malicious actors used malvertising to distribute a piece of malware via cloned webpages of legitimate organizations," Trend Micro researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. "In this case, the distribution involved a webpage of the well-known application WinSCP, an open-source Windows application for file transfer." Malvertising &nbsp; refers &nbsp;to the use of&nbsp; SEO poisoning techniques &nbsp;to spread malware via online advertising. It typically involves hijacking a chosen set of keywords to display bogus ads on Bing and Google search results pages with the goal of redirecting unsuspecting users to sketchy pages. The idea is to trick users searching for applications like WinSCP into downloading malware, in this instance, a backdoor that contains a&nbsp; Cobalt Strike Beacon &nbsp;that connects to a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have pulled back the curtain on an updated version of an Apple macOS malware called RustBucket that comes with improved&nbsp;capabilities to establish persistence and avoid detection by security software. "This variant of RustBucket, a malware family that targets macOS systems, adds persistence capabilities not previously observed," Elastic Security Labs researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week, adding it's "leveraging a dynamic network infrastructure methodology for command-and-control." RustBucket is the work of a North Korean threat actor known as BlueNoroff, which is part of a larger intrusion set tracked under the name&nbsp; Lazarus Group , an elite hacking unit supervised by the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), the country's primary intelligence agency. The malware came to light in April 2023, when Jamf Threat Labs&nbsp; described &nbsp;it as an AppleScript-based backdoor capable of retrieving a second-stage payload from a remote server. Elas

Charming Kitten, the nation-state actor affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has been attributed to a bespoke spear-phishing campaign that delivers an updated version of a fully-featured PowerShell backdoor called POWERSTAR. "There have been improved operational security measures placed in the malware to make it more difficult to analyze and collect intelligence," Volexity researchers Ankur Saini and Charlie Gardner said in a report published this week. The threat actor is something of an expert when it comes to employing social engineering to lure targets, often crafting tailored fake personas on social media platforms and engaging in sustained conversations to build rapport before sending a malicious link. It's also tracked under the names APT35, Cobalt Illusion, Mint Sandstorm (formerly Phosphorus), and Yellow Garuda.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Meta's WhatsApp has rolled out updates to its proxy feature, allowing more flexibility in the kind of content that can be shared in conversations. This includes the ability to send and receive images, voice notes, files, stickers and GIFs, WhatsApp told The Hacker News. The new features were&nbsp; first reported &nbsp;by BBC Persian. Some of the other improvements include streamlined steps to simplify the setup process as well as the introduction of shareable links to "share functioning/valid proxy addresses to their contacts for easy and automatic installation." Support for&nbsp; proxy servers &nbsp;was officially launched by the messaging service&nbsp; earlier this January , thereby helping users circumvent government-imposed censorship and internet shutdowns and obtain indirect access to WhatsApp. The company has also made available a&nbsp; reference implementation &nbsp;for setting up a proxy server with ports 80, 443 or 5222 available and domain name that points to the server's IP address. &amp;

Cybercriminals Hijacking Vulnerable SSH Servers in New Proxyjacking Campaign<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/cybercriminals-hijacking-vulnerable-ssh.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An active financially motivated campaign is targeting vulnerable SSH servers to covertly ensnare them into a proxy network. "This is an active campaign in which the attacker leverages SSH for remote access, running malicious scripts that stealthily enlist victim servers into a peer-to-peer (P2P) proxy network, such as Peer2Profit or Honeygain," Akamai researcher Allen West said in a Thursday report. Unlike cryptojacking, in which a compromised system's resources are used to illicitly mine cryptocurrency, proxyjacking offers the ability for threat actors to leverage the victim's unused bandwidth to covertly run different services as a P2P node. This offers two-fold benefits: It not only enables the attacker to monetize the extra bandwidth with a significantly reduced resource load that would be necessary to carry out cryptojacking, it also reduces the chances of discovery. "It is a stealthier alternative to cryptojacking and has serious implications that ca

MITRE has released its annual list of the Top 25 "most dangerous software weaknesses" for the year 2023. "These weaknesses lead to serious vulnerabilities in software," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&nbsp; said . "An attacker can often exploit these vulnerabilities to take control of an affected system, steal data, or prevent applications from working." The&nbsp; list &nbsp;is based on an&nbsp; analysis &nbsp;of public vulnerability data in the National Vulnerability Data ( NVD ) for root cause mappings to CWE weaknesses for the previous two years. A total of 43,996 CVE entries were examined and a score was attached to each of them based on prevalence and severity. Coming out top is Out-of-bounds Write, followed by Cross-site Scripting, SQL Injection, Use After Free, OS Command Injection, Improper Input Validation, Out-of-bounds Read, Path Traversal, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian state-sponsored group dubbed MuddyWater has been attributed to a previously unseen command-and-control (C2) framework called&nbsp; PhonyC2 &nbsp;that's been put to use by the actor since 2021. Evidence shows that the custom made, actively developed framework has been leveraged in the&nbsp; February 2023 attack on Technion , an Israeli research institute, cybersecurity firm Deep Instinct said in a report shared with The Hacker News. What's more, additional links have been unearthed between the Python 3-based program and other attacks carried out by MuddyWater, including the&nbsp; ongoing exploitation of PaperCut servers . "It is structurally and functionally similar to&nbsp; MuddyC3 , a previous MuddyWater&nbsp; custom C2 framework &nbsp;that was written in Python 2," security researcher Simon Kenin said. "MuddyWater is continuously updating the PhonyC2 framework and changing TTPs to avoid detection." MuddyWater, also known as Mango Sandstorm (previously Mercury), is a cyber

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have shared the inner workings of an Android malware family called&nbsp; Fluhorse . The malware "represents a significant shift as it incorporates the malicious components directly within the Flutter code," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Axelle Apvrille&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. Fluhorse was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Check Point in early May 2023, detailing its attacks on users located in East Asia through rogue apps masquerading as ETC and VPBank Neo, which are popular in Taiwan and Vietnam. The initial intrusion vector for the malware is phishing. The ultimate goal of the app is to steal credentials, credit card details, and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes received as SMS to a remote server under the control of the threat actors. The latest findings from Fortinet, which reverse-engineered a&nbsp; Fluhorse sample &nbsp;uploaded to VirusTotal on June 11, 2023, suggest that the malware has evolved, incorporating additional sophistication b

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cyber threat intelligence is an effective weapon in the ongoing battle to protect digital assets and infrastructure - especially when combined with AI. But AI is only as good as the data feeding it. Access to unique, underground sources is key. Threat Intelligence offers tremendous value to people and companies. At the same time, its ability to address organizations' cybersecurity needs and the benefits it offers vary by company, industry, and other factors. A common challenge with cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is that the data it produces can be vast and overwhelming, creating confusion and inefficiencies among security teams' threat exposure management efforts. Additionally, organizations have different levels of security maturity, which can make access to and understanding of CTI data difficult. Enter generative AI. Many cybersecurity companies – and more specifically, threat intelligence companies – are bringing generative AI to market to simplify threat intelligence a

Tracked as CVE-2023-2982 (CVSS score: 9.8), the authentication bypass flaw impacts all versions of the plugin, including and prior to 7.6.4. It was addressed on June 14, 2023, with the release of version 7.6.5 following responsible disclosure on June 2, 2023. "The vulnerability makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to any account on a site including accounts used to administer the site, if the attacker knows, or can find, the associated email address," Wordfence researcher István Márton&nbsp; said . The issue is rooted in the fact that the encryption key used to secure the information during login using social media accounts is hard-coded, thus leading to a scenario where attackers could create a valid request with a properl

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Windows-based information stealer called&nbsp; ThirdEye &nbsp;has been discovered in the wild with capabilities to harvest sensitive data from infected hosts. Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, which&nbsp; made the discovery , said it found the malware in an executable that masqueraded as a&nbsp; PDF file &nbsp;with a Russian name "CMK Правила оформления больничных листов.pdf.exe," which translates to "CMK Rules for issuing sick leaves.pdf.exe." The arrival vector for the malware is presently unknown, although the nature of the lure points to it being used in a phishing campaign. The very&nbsp; first ThirdEye sample &nbsp;was uploaded to VirusTotal on April 4, 2023, with relatively fewer features. The evolving stealer, like&nbsp; other malware families &nbsp;of its kind, is equipped to gather system metadata, including BIOS release date and vendor, total/free disk space on the C drive, currently running processes, register usernames, and volume information. The amassed details are then tra

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Drones that don't have any known security weaknesses could be the target of electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) attacks, potentially enabling a threat actor to achieve arbitrary code execution and compromise their functionality and safety. The research comes from IOActive, which&nbsp; found &nbsp;that it is "feasible to compromise the targeted device by injecting a specific EM glitch at the right time during a firmware update." "This would allow an attacker to gain code execution on the main processor, gaining access to the Android OS that implements the core functionality of the drone," Gabriel Gonzalez, director of hardware security at the company, said in a report published this month. The&nbsp; study , which was undertaken to determine the current security posture of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), was carried out on&nbsp; Mavic Pro , a popular quadcopter drone manufactured by DJI that employs various security features like signed and encrypted firmware, Trusted Executi

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have exposed the workings of a scam ring called CryptosLabs that's estimated to have made €480 million in illegal profits by targeting users in French-speaking individuals in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg since April 2018. The syndicate's massive fake investment schemes primarily involve impersonating 40 well-known banks, fin-techs, asset management firms, and crypto platforms, setting up a scam infrastructure spanning over 350 domains hosted on more than 80 servers, Group-IB&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep-dive report. The Singapore-headquartered company described the criminal outfit as "operated by a hierarchy of kingpins, sales agents, developers, and call center operators" who are recruited to ensnare potential victims by promising high returns on their capital. "CryptoLabs made their scam schemes more convincing through region-focused tactics, such as hiring French-speaking callers as 'managers' and creating fake landing pages, socia

5 Things CISOs Need to Know About Securing OT Environments<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/5-things-cisos-need-to-know-about.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For too long the cybersecurity world focused exclusively on information technology (IT), leaving operational technology (OT) to fend for itself. Traditionally, few industrial enterprises had dedicated cybersecurity leaders. Any security decisions that arose fell to the plant and factory managers, who are highly skilled technical experts in other areas but often lack cybersecurity training or knowledge. In more recent years, an uptick in cyberattacks against industrial facilities and the trend of IT/OT convergence driven by Industry 4.0 have highlighted the vacuum of ownership around OT security.&nbsp; According to a new Fortinet report , most organizations are looking to Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) to solve the problem. Fortunately, CISOs are no strangers to change or difficult challenges. The position itself is less than 20 years old, yet in those two decades CISOs have navigated some of the most disruptive cybersecurity events that were truly watershed moments in techno

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A ransomware threat called 8Base that has been operating under the radar for over a year has been attributed to a "massive spike in activity" in May and June 2023. "The group utilizes encryption paired with 'name-and-shame' techniques to compel their victims to pay their ransoms," VMware Carbon Black researchers Deborah Snyder and Fae Carlisle&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "8Base has an opportunistic pattern of compromise with recent victims spanning across varied industries." 8Base, according to statistics gathered by&nbsp; Malwarebytes &nbsp;and&nbsp; NCC Group , has been linked to 67 attacks as of May 2023, with about 50% of the victims&nbsp; operating &nbsp;in the business services, manufacturing, and construction sectors. A majority of the targeted companies are located in the U.S. and Brazil. With very little known about the operators of the ransomware, its origins remain something of a cipher.

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Gentoo Soko that could lead to remote code execution (RCE) on vulnerable systems. "These SQL injections happened despite the use of an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library and prepared statements," SonarSource researcher Thomas Chauchefoin&nbsp; said , adding they could result in RCE on Soko because of a "misconfiguration of the database." The&nbsp; two &nbsp; issues , which were discovered in the search feature of Soko, have been collectively tracked as CVE-2023-28424 (CVSS score: 9.1).

Soko is a Go software module that powers&nbsp; packages.gentoo.org , offering users an easy way to search through different Portage packages that are available for Gentoo Linux distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new process injection technique dubbed Mockingjay could be exploited by threat actors to bypass security solutions to execute malicious code on compromised systems. "The injection is executed without space allocation, setting permissions or even starting a thread," Security Joes researchers Thiago Peixoto, Felipe Duarte, and Ido Naor&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The uniqueness of this technique is that it requires a vulnerable DLL and copying code to the right section." Process injection is an&nbsp; attack method &nbsp;that allows adversaries to inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses and elevate privileges. In doing so, it could allow for the execution of arbitrary code in the memory space of a separate live process. Some of the well-known process injection techniques include dynamic link library (DLL) injection, portable executable injection, thread execution hijacking, process hollowing, and process doppelgänging, amon

New Ongoing Campaign Targets npm Ecosystem with Unique Execution Chain<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-ongoing-campaign-targets-npm.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new ongoing campaign aimed at the npm&nbsp;ecosystem that leverages a unique execution chain to deliver an unknown payload to targeted systems. "The packages in question seem to be published in pairs, each pair working in unison to fetch additional resources which are subsequently decoded and/or executed," software supply chain security firm Phylum&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report released last week. To that end, the order in which the pair of packages are installed is paramount to pulling off a successful attack, as the first of the two modules are designed to store locally a token retrieved from a remote server. The campaign was first discovered on June 11, 2023. The second package subsequently passes this token as a parameter alongside the operating system type to an&nbsp; HTTP GET request &nbsp;to acquire a second script from the remote server. A successful execution returns a Base64-encoded string that is immediately executed but only if that string is

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the business environment becomes increasingly connected, organizations' attack surfaces continue to expand, making it challenging to map and secure both known and unknown assets. In particular, unknown assets present security challenges related to shadow IT, misconfigurations, ineffective scan coverage, among others. Given attack surface sprawl and evolving threats, many organizations are embracing&nbsp; attack surface management (ASM) &nbsp;tools to discover and address critical exposures. Asset discovery is an important capability to have, and one that's helping to drive the adoption of attack surface management tools and services. That said, asset discovery is only one aspect of effective attack surface management. Making the attack surface as impenetrable as possible takes offensive security that goes far beyond the discovery phase. Why Asset Discovery Isn't Enough&nbsp; Given the complexity and ever-expanding scale of the digital infrastructure at most companies, cataloging all the known

A new Android malware campaign has been observed pushing the Anatsa banking trojan to target banking customers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria, and Switzerland since the start of March 2023.

Researchers Find Way to Recover Cryptographic Keys by Analyzing LED Flickers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/researchers-find-way-to-recover.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's an ingenious&nbsp; side-channel attack , a group of academics has found that it's possible to recover secret keys from a device by analyzing video footage of its power LED. "Cryptographic computations performed by the CPU change the power consumption of the device which affects the brightness of the device's power LED," researchers from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Cornell University&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a study. By taking advantage of this observation, it's possible for threat actors to leverage video camera devices such as an iPhone 13 or an internet-connected surveillance camera to extract the cryptographic keys from a smart card reader­. Specifically, video-based cryptanalysis is accomplished by obtaining video footage of rapid changes in an LED's brightness and exploiting the video camera's&nbsp; rolling shutter &nbsp;effect to capture the physical emanations. "This is caused by the fact that the power LED is connected directly to the pow

Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Falls Victim to JokerSpy macOS Backdoor Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/japanese-cryptocurrency-exchange-falls.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown cryptocurrency exchange located in Japan was the target of a new attack earlier this month to deploy an Apple macOS backdoor called JokerSpy. Elastic Security Labs, which is monitoring the intrusion set under the name&nbsp; REF9134 ,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the attack led to the installation of Swiftbelt, a Swift-based enumeration tool inspired by an open-source utility called&nbsp; SeatBelt . JokerSky was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Bitdefender last week, describing it as a sophisticated toolkit designed to breach macOS machines. Very little is known about the threat actor behind the operation other than the fact that the attacks leverage a set of programs written in Python and Swift that come with capabilities to gather data and execute arbitrary commands on compromised hosts. A primary component of the toolkit is a self-signed multi-architecture binary known as xcc that's engineered to check for FullDiskAccess and ScreenRecording permissions. The file is signed as XProtectCheck, indicating an

Security and IT teams are routinely forced to adopt software before fully understanding the security risks. And AI tools are no exception. Employees and business leaders alike are flocking to generative AI software and similar programs, often unaware of the major SaaS security vulnerabilities they're introducing into the enterprise. A February 2023&nbsp; generative AI survey of 1,000 executives &nbsp;revealed that 49% of respondents use ChatGPT now, and 30% plan to tap into the ubiquitous generative AI tool soon. Ninety-nine percent of those using ChatGPT claimed some form of cost-savings, and 25% attested to reducing expenses by $75,000 or more. As the researchers conducted this survey a mere three months after ChatGPT's general availability, today's ChatGPT and AI tool usage is undoubtedly higher.&nbsp; Security and risk teams are already overwhelmed protecting their SaaS estate (which has now become the operating system of business) from common vulnerabilities such as misconfigurati

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has&nbsp; added &nbsp;a batch of six flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. This comprises three vulnerabilities that Apple patched this week ( CVE-2023-32434, CVE-2023-32435, and CVE-2023-32439 ), two flaws in VMware ( CVE-2023-20867 &nbsp;and&nbsp; CVE-2023-20887 ), and one shortcoming impacting Zyxel devices ( CVE-2023-27992 ). CVE-2023-32434 and CVE-2023-32435, both of which allow code execution, are said to have been exploited as zero-days to deploy spyware as part of a years-long cyber espionage campaign that commenced in 2019. Dubbed Operation Triangulation, the activity culminates in the deployment of&nbsp; TriangleDB &nbsp;that's designed to harvest a wide range of information from compromised devices, such as creating, modifying, removing, and stealing files, listing and terminating processes, gathering credentials from iCloud Keychain, and tracking a user's location.

A U.K. citizen who took part in the massive July 2020 hack of Twitter has been sentenced to five years in prison in the U.S. Joseph James O'Connor (aka PlugwalkJoe), 24, was awarded the sentence on Friday in the Southern District of New York, a little over a month&nbsp; after &nbsp;he&nbsp; pleaded guilty &nbsp;to the criminal schemes. He was&nbsp; arrested &nbsp;in Spain in July 2021. The infamous Twitter breach allowed the defendant and his co-conspirators to obtain unauthorized access to backend tools used by Twitter, abusing them to hijack 130 popular accounts to perpetrate a crypto scam that netted them about $120,000 in illegal profits. "In other instances, the co-conspirators sold access to Twitter accounts to others," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)&nbsp; said . "O'Connor communicated with others regarding purchasing unauthorized access to a variety of Twitter accounts, including accounts associated with public figures around the world."

Cybercrime Group 'Muddled Libra' Targets BPO Sector with Advanced Social Engineering<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/cybercrime-group-muddled-libra-targets.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor known as&nbsp; Muddled Libra &nbsp;is targeting the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry with persistent attacks that leverage advanced social engineering ploys to gain initial access. "The attack style defining Muddled Libra appeared on the cybersecurity radar in late 2022 with the release of the 0ktapus phishing kit, which offered a prebuilt hosting framework and bundled templates," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. Libra is the&nbsp; designation &nbsp;given by the cybersecurity company for cybercrime groups. The "muddled" moniker for the threat actor stems from the prevailing ambiguity with regards to the use of the 0ktapus framework. 0ktapus , also known as Scatter Swine, refers to an intrusion set that first came to light in August 2022 in connection with smishing attacks against over 100 organizations, including Twilio and Cloudflare.

The case for browser fingerprinting: personalizing user experience, improving fraud detection, and optimizing login security Have you ever heard of browser fingerprinting? You should! It's an online user identification technique that collects information about a visitor's web browser and its configuration preferences to associate individual browsing sessions with a single website visitor.&nbsp; With browser fingerprinting, many pieces of data can be collected about a user's web browser and device, such as screen resolution, location, language, and operating system. When you stitch these pieces together, they reveal a unique combination of information that forms every user's visitor ID or "digital fingerprint." Websites can use the visitor ID in various ways, including personalizing the user's experience, improving fraud detection, and optimizing login security.

Powerful JavaScript Dropper PindOS Distributes Bumblebee and IcedID Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/powerful-javascript-dropper-pindos.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new strain of JavaScript dropper has been observed delivering next-stage payloads like Bumblebee and IcedID. Cybersecurity firm Deep Instinct is tracking the malware as&nbsp; PindOS , which contains the name in its " User-Agent " string. Both&nbsp; Bumblebee &nbsp;and IcedID serve as loaders, acting as a vector for other malware on compromised hosts, including ransomware. A recent report from Proofpoint&nbsp; highlighted &nbsp;IcedID's abandoning of banking fraud features to solely focus on malware delivery. Bumblebee , notably, is a replacement for another loader called&nbsp; BazarLoader , which has been attributed to the now-defunct TrickBot and Conti groups. A report from Secureworks in April 2022&nbsp; found &nbsp;evidence of collaboration between several actors in the Russian cybercrime ecosystem, including that of&nbsp; Conti ,&nbsp; Emotet , and IcedID. Deep Instinct's source code analysis of PindOS shows that it contains comments in Russian, raising the possibility of a continued partnership between

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) on Thursday released guidance to help organizations detect and prevent infections of a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) bootkit called&nbsp; BlackLotus . To that end, the agency is&nbsp; recommending &nbsp;that "infrastructure owners take action by hardening user executable policies and monitoring the integrity of the boot partition." BlackLotus is an&nbsp; advanced &nbsp;crimeware solution that was first spotlighted in October 2022 by Kaspersky. A UEFI bootkit capable of bypassing Windows Secure Boot protections, samples of the malware have since emerged in the wild. This is accomplished by taking advantage of a known Windows flaw called Baton Drop ( CVE-2022-21894 , CVSS score: 4.4) discovered in vulnerable&nbsp; boot loaders &nbsp;not added into the&nbsp; Secure Boot DBX revocation list . The vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft in January 2022. This loophole could be exploited by threat actors to replace fully patched boot loaders with vulnerable v

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Internet-facing Linux systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being targeted as part of a new campaign designed to illicitly mine cryptocurrency. "The threat actors behind the attack use a backdoor that deploys a wide array of tools and components such as rootkits and an IRC bot to steal device resources for mining operations," Microsoft threat intelligence researcher Rotem Sde-Or&nbsp; said . "The backdoor also installs a patched version of OpenSSH on affected devices, allowing threat actors to hijack SSH credentials, move laterally within the network, and conceal malicious SSH connections." To pull off the scheme, misconfigured Linux hosts are brute-forced to gain initial access, following which the threat actors move to disable shell history and fetch a trojanized version of OpenSSH from a remote server. The rogue OpenSSH package is configured to install and launch the backdoor, a shell script that allows the attackers to distribute additional payloads a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new phishing campaign codenamed&nbsp; MULTI#STORM &nbsp;has set its sights on India and the U.S. by leveraging JavaScript files to deliver remote access trojans on compromised systems. "The attack chain ends with the victim machine infected with multiple unique RAT (remote access trojan) malware instances, such as Warzone RAT and Quasar RAT," Securonix researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov&nbsp; said . "Both are used for command-and-control during different stages of the infection chain." The multi-stage attack chain commences when an email recipient clicks the embedded link pointing to a password-protected ZIP file ("REQUEST.zip") hosted on Microsoft OneDrive with the password "12345." Extracting the archive file reveals a heavily obfuscated JavaScript file ("REQUEST.js") that, when double clicked, activates the infection by executing two PowerShell commands that are responsible for retrieving two separate payloads from OneDri

Alert: Million of GitHub Repositories Likely Vulnerable to RepoJacking Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/alert-million-of-github-repositories.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Millions of software repositories on GitHub are likely vulnerable to an attack called RepoJacking , a new study has revealed. This includes repositories from organizations such as Google, Lyft, and several others, Massachusetts-based cloud-native security firm Aqua&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report. The supply chain vulnerability, also known as dependency repository hijacking, is a&nbsp; class of attacks &nbsp;that makes it possible to take over&nbsp;retired organization or user names and publish trojanized versions of repositories to run malicious code. "When a repository owner changes their username, a link is created between the old name and the new name for anyone who downloads dependencies from the old repository," researchers Ilay Goldman and Yakir Kadkoda said. "However, it is possible for anyone to create the old username and break this link." Alternatively, a similar scenario could arise when a repository ownership is transferred to another user and the original account

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Chinese cyber espionage actor known as&nbsp; Camaro Dragon &nbsp;has been observed leveraging a new strain of self-propagating malware that spreads through compromised USB drives. "While their primary focus has traditionally been Southeast Asian countries, this latest discovery reveals their global reach and highlights the alarming role USB drives play in spreading malware," Check Point said in new research shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company, which found evidence of USB malware infections in Myanmar, South Korea, Great Britain, India, and Russia, said the findings are the result of a cyber incident that it investigated at an unnamed European hospital in early 2023. The probe found that the entity was not directly targeted by the adversary but rather suffered a breach via an employee's USB drive, which became infected when it was plugged into a colleague's computer at a conference in Asia.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Why Data Exfiltration Detection is Paramount? The world is witnessing an exponential rise in ransomware and data theft employed to extort companies. At the same time, the industry faces numerous critical vulnerabilities in database software and company websites. This evolution paints a dire picture of data exposure and exfiltration that every security leader and team is grappling with. This article highlights this challenge and expounds on the benefits that Machine Learning algorithms and Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) approaches bring to the table. Data exfiltration often serves as the final act of a cyberattack, making it the last window of opportunity to detect the breach before the data is made public or is used for other sinister activities, such as espionage. However, data leakage isn't only an aftermath of cyberattacks, it can also be a consequence of human error. While prevention of data exfiltration through security controls is ideal, the escalating complexity a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical security flaw has been disclosed in the WordPress "Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce" plugin that's&nbsp; installed &nbsp;on more than 30,000 websites. "This vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker to gain access to the accounts of users who have abandoned their carts, who are typically customers but can extend to other high-level users when the right conditions are met," Defiant's Wordfence&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. Tracked as CVE-2023-2986, the shortcoming has been rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS scoring system. It impacts all versions of the plugin, including and prior to versions 5.14.2. The problem, at its core, is a case of authentication bypass that arises as a result of insufficient encryption protections that are applied when customers are notified when they have abandoned their shopping carts on e-commerce sites without completing the purchase. Specifically, the encryption key is hard-coded in the plugin, thereby allowing

The North Korean threat actor known as ScarCruft has been observed using an information-stealing malware with previous undocumented wiretapping features as well as a backdoor developed using Golang that exploits the Ably real-time messaging service. "The threat actor sent their commands through the Golang backdoor that is using the Ably service," the AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC) said in a technical report. "The API key value required for command communication was saved in a GitHub repository." ScarCruft is a state-sponsored outfit with links to North Korea's Ministry of State Security (MSS). It's known to be active since at least 2012. Attack chains mounted by the group entail the use of spear-phishing lures to deliver RokRAT , although it has leveraged a wide range of other custom tools to harvest sensitive information.

More details have emerged about the spyware implant that's delivered to iOS devices as part of a campaign called Operation Triangulation. Kaspersky, which&nbsp; discovered the operation &nbsp;after becoming one of the targets at the start of the year, said the malware has a lifespan of 30 days, after which it gets automatically uninstalled unless the time period is extended by the attackers. The Russian cybersecurity company has codenamed the backdoor&nbsp; TriangleDB . "The implant is deployed after the attackers obtain root privileges on the target iOS device by exploiting a kernel vulnerability," Kaspersky researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today. "It is deployed in memory, meaning that all traces of the implant are lost when the device gets rebooted. Therefore, if the victim reboots their device, the attackers have to reinfect it by sending an iMessage with a malicious attachment, thus launching the whole exploitation chain again."

When we do quarterly&nbsp; planning , my team categorizes our goals within four evergreen outcomes: Reduce the risk of information security incidents Increase trust in Vanta's information security program Reduce the friction caused by information security controls Use security expertise to support the business In this article, I'm going to focus on number three: reducing friction. Declaring your intentions There is value in making "reducing friction" an explicit goal of your security program. It sets the right tone with your counterparts across the organization, and is one step toward building a positive security culture. The first time I presented those outcomes in a company-wide forum, I received a Slack message from a senior leader who had just joined the company: "fantastic to hear about the security's teams focus on removing invisible security controls. Excellent philosophy for the security team [...] its just awesome too many security teams vi

Critical 'nOAuth' Flaw in Microsoft Azure AD Enabled Complete Account Takeover<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/critical-noauth-flaw-in-microsoft-azure.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security shortcoming in Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) Open Authorization ( OAuth ) process could have been exploited to achieve full account takeover, researchers said. California-based identity and access management service Descope, which discovered and reported the issue in April 2023, dubbed it&nbsp; nOAuth . "nOAuth is an authentication implementation flaw that can affect Microsoft Azure AD multi-tenant OAuth applications," Omer Cohen, chief security officer at Descope,&nbsp; said . The misconfiguration has to do with how a malicious actor can modify email attributes under "Contact Information" in the Azure AD account and exploit the "Log in with Microsoft" feature to hijack a victim account. To pull off the attack, all an adversary has to do is to create and access an Azure AD admin account and modify their email address to that of a victim and take advantage of the single sign-on scheme on a vulnerable app or website.

Foreign affairs ministries in the Americas have been targeted by a Chinese state-sponsored actor named&nbsp; Flea &nbsp;as part of a recent campaign that spanned from late 2022 to early 2023. The cyber attacks, per Broadcom's Symantec, involved a new backdoor codenamed Graphican. Some of the other targets included a government finance department and a corporation that markets products in the Americas as well as one unspecified victim in an European country. "Flea used a large number of tools in this campaign," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News, describing the threat actor as "large and well-resourced." "As well as the new Graphican backdoor, the attackers leveraged a variety of living-off-the-land tools, as well as tools that have been previously linked to Flea."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware called&nbsp; Condi &nbsp;has been observed exploiting a security vulnerability in TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800) Wi-Fi routers to rope the devices into a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet. Fortinet FortiGuard Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;the campaign has ramped up since the end of May 2023. Condi is the work of a threat actor who goes by the online alias zxcr9999 on Telegram and runs a Telegram channel called Condi Network to advertise their warez. "The Telegram channel was started in May 2022, and the threat actor has been monetizing its botnet by providing DDoS-as-a-service and selling the malware source code," security researchers Joie Salvio and Roy Tay said. An analysis of the malware artifact reveals its ability to terminate other competing botnets on the same host. It, however, lacks a persistence mechanism, meaning the program cannot survive a system reboot. To get around this limitation, the malware deletes multiple binaries that are used to shut down or reboot the

Three security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in operational technology (OT) products from Wago and Schneider Electric. The flaws, per Forescout, are part of a&nbsp; broader &nbsp; set &nbsp;of&nbsp; shortcomings &nbsp;collectively called&nbsp; OT:ICEFALL , which now comprises a total of 61 issues spanning 13 different vendors. "OT:ICEFALL demonstrates the need for tighter scrutiny of, and improvements to, processes related to secure design, patching and testing in OT device vendors," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The most severe of the flaws is&nbsp; CVE-2022-46680 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), which concerns the plaintext transmission of credentials in the ION/TCP protocol used by power meters from Schneider Electric. Successful exploitation of the bug could enable threat actors to gain control of vulnerable devices. It's worth noting that CVE-2022-46680 is one among the 56 flaws&nbsp; originally unearthed &nbsp;by Forescout in June 2022. The other two new security holes ( CVE-2023

Despite each franchise being independently owned and operated, they share subscriptions to SaaS applications, or use multiple tenants of the same application. Each app is typically segmented by store. Corporate IT and Security has access to the entire database, while each franchise has visibility into its own data.&nbsp; These SaaS apps cover everything from CRMs to supply chains to marketing and HR.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A highly targeted cyber attack against an East Asian IT company involved the deployment of a custom malware written in Golang called&nbsp; RDStealer . "The operation was active for more than a year with the end goal of compromising credentials and data exfiltration," Bitdefender security researcher Victor Vrabie&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. Evidence gathered by the Romanian cybersecurity firm shows that the campaign started in early 2022. The target was an unspecified IT company located in East Asia. In the early phases, the operation relied on readily available remote access trojans like AsyncRAT and Cobalt Strike, before transitioning to bespoke malware in late 2021 or early 2022 in a bid to thwart detection. A primary evasion tactic concerns the use of Microsoft Windows folders that are likely to be excluded from scanning by security software (e.g., System32 and Program Files) to store the backdoor payloads.

"The number of available logs containing compromised ChatGPT accounts reached a peak of 26,802 in May 2023," the Singapore-headquartered company&nbsp; said . "The Asia-Pacific region has experienced the highest concentration of ChatGPT credentials being offered for sale over the past year." Other countries with the most number of compromised ChatGPT credentials include Pakistan, Brazil, Vietnam, Egypt, the U.S., France, Morocco, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. A further analysis has revealed that the majority of logs containing ChatGPT accounts have been breached by the notorious Raccoon info steal

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Individuals in the Pakistan region have been targeted using two rogue Android apps available on the Google Play Store as part of a new targeted campaign. Cybersecurity firm Cyfirma attributed the campaign with moderate confidence to a threat actor known as&nbsp; DoNot Team , which is also tracked as APT-C-35 and Viceroy Tiger. The espionage activity involves duping Android smartphone owners into downloading a program that's used to extract contact and location data from unwitting victims. "The motive behind the attack is to gather information via the stager payload and use the gathered information for the second-stage attack, using malware with more destructive features," the company&nbsp; said . DoNot Team &nbsp;is a suspected India-nexus threat actor that has a reputation for carrying out attacks against various countries in South Asia. It has been active since at least 2016.

New Mystic Stealer Malware Targets 40 Web Browsers and 70 Browser Extensions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-mystic-stealer-malware-targets-40.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new information-stealing malware called&nbsp; Mystic Stealer &nbsp;has been found to steal data from about 40 different web browsers and over 70 web browser extensions. First advertised on April 25, 2023, for $150 per month, the malware also targets cryptocurrency wallets, Steam, and Telegram, and employs extensive mechanisms to resist analysis. "The code is heavily obfuscated making use of polymorphic string obfuscation, hash-based import resolution, and runtime calculation of constants,"&nbsp; InQuest &nbsp;and&nbsp; Zscaler &nbsp;researchers said in an analysis published last week. Mystic Stealer, like many other crimeware solutions that are offered for sale, focuses on pilfering data and is implemented in the C programming language. The control panel has been developed using Python. Updates to the malware in May 2023 incorporate a loader component that allows it to retrieve and execute next-stage payloads fetched from a command-and-control (C2) server, making it a more formidable threat.

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a set of malicious artifacts that they say is part of a sophisticated toolkit targeting Apple macOS systems. "As of now, these samples are still largely undetected and very little information is available about any of them," Bitdefender researchers Andrei Lapusneanu and Bogdan Botezatu&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a preliminary report published on Friday. The Romanian firm's analysis is based on an examination of four samples that were uploaded to VirusTotal by an unnamed victim. The earliest sample dates back to April 18, 2023. Two of the three malicious programs are said to be generic Python-based backdoors that are designed to target Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. The payloads have been collectively dubbed&nbsp; JokerSpy . The first constituent is shared.dat, which, once launched, runs an operating system check (0 for Windows, 1 for macOS, and 2 for Linux) and establishes contact with a remote server to fetch additional instructions for execut

Microsoft on Friday attributed a string of service outages aimed at Azure, Outlook, and OneDrive earlier this month to an uncategorized cluster it tracks under the name&nbsp; Storm-1359 .

While there is no evidence that any customer data was accessed or compromised, the company noted the attacks "temporarily impacted availability" of some services.

From Cryptojacking to DDoS Attacks: Diicot Expands Tactics with Cayosin Botnet<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/from-cryptojacking-to-ddos-attacks.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered previously undocumented payloads associated with a Romanian threat actor named&nbsp; Diicot , revealing its potential for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. "The Diicot name is significant, as it's also the name of the&nbsp; Romanian organized crime and anti-terrorism policing unit ," Cado Security&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. "In addition, artifacts from the group's campaigns contain messaging and imagery related to this organization." Diicot (née Mexals) was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Bitdefender in July 2021, uncovering the actor's use of a Go-based SSH brute-forcer tool called Diicot Brute to breach Linux hosts as part of a cryptojacking campaign. Then earlier this April, Akamai&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;what it described as a "resurgence" of the 2021 activity that's believed to have started around October 2022, netting the actor about $10,000 in illicit profits. "The attackers use a long ch

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor known as&nbsp; ChamelGang &nbsp;has been observed using a previously undocumented implant to backdoor Linux systems, marking a new expansion of the threat actor's capabilities. The malware, dubbed&nbsp; ChamelDoH &nbsp;by Stairwell, is a C++-based tool for communicating via DNS-over-HTTPS ( DoH ) tunneling. ChamelGang was&nbsp; first outed &nbsp;by Russian cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies in September 2021, detailing its attacks on fuel, energy, and aviation production industries in Russia, the U.S., India, Nepal, Taiwan, and Japan. Attack chains mounted by the actor have leveraged vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application to gain initial access and carry out data theft attacks using a passive backdoor called DoorMe. "This is a native&nbsp; IIS module &nbsp;that is registered as a filter through which HTTP requests and responses are processed," Positive Technologies said at the time.

As Threat Actors Continuously Adapt their TTPs in Today's Threat Landscape, So Must You Earlier this year, threat researchers at Cybersixgill released the annual report,&nbsp; The State of the Cybercrime Underground . &nbsp;The research stems from an analysis of Cybersixgill's collected intelligence items throughout 2022, gathered from the deep, dark and clear web. The report examines the continuous evolution of threat actors' tactics, tools, and procedures (TTPs) in the Digital Age – and how organizations can adapt to reduce risk and maintain business resilience. This article summarizes a few of the report's findings, including trends in credit card fraud, observations about cryptocurrency, AI developments and how they're lowering barriers to entry to cybercrime, and the rise of cybercriminal "as-a-service" activities. Further below, I also discuss the need for a new security approach, combining attack surface management (ASM) and cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Thursday unveiled charges against a Russian national for his alleged involvement in deploying LockBit ransomware to targets in the U.S., Asia, Europe, and Africa. Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov, 20, of Chechen Republic has been accused of perpetrating at least five attacks between August 2020 and March 2023. He was arrested in the state of Arizona last month. "Astamirov allegedly participated in a conspiracy with other members of the LockBit ransomware campaign to commit wire fraud and to intentionally damage protected computers and make ransom demands through the use and deployment of ransomware," the DoJ&nbsp; said . Astamirov, as part of his LockBit-related activities, managed various email addresses, IP addresses, and other online accounts to deploy the ransomware and communicate with the victims.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Progress Software on Thursday&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a third vulnerability impacting its MOVEit Transfer application, as the Cl0p cybercrime gang deployed extortion tactics against affected companies. The&nbsp; new flaw , which is being tracked as CVE-2023-35708 , also concerns an SQL injection vulnerability that "could lead to escalated privileges and potential unauthorized access to the environment." The company is urging its customers to disable all HTTP and HTTPs traffic to MOVEit Transfer on ports 80 and 443 to safeguard their environments while a fix is being prepared to address the weakness. The cloud managed file transfer solution has been fully patched. The revelation comes a week after Progress&nbsp; divulged &nbsp;another set of SQL injection vulnerabilities ( CVE-2023-35036 ) that it said could be weaponized to access the application's database content. The vulnerabilities join&nbsp; CVE-2023-34362 , which was&nbsp; exploited &nbsp;as a zero-day by the Clop ransomware gang in data theft attacks

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recently patched security flaw in the popular WinRAR archiving software has been exploited as a zero-day since April 2023, new findings from Group-IB reveal. The vulnerability, cataloged as&nbsp; CVE-2023-38831 , allows threat actors to spoof file extensions, thereby making it possible to launch malicious scripts contained within an archive that masquerades as seemingly innocuous image or text files. It was addressed in&nbsp; version 6.23 &nbsp;released on August 2, 2023, alongside CVE-2023-40477. In attacks discovered by the Singapore-based firm in July 2023, specially crafted ZIP or RAR archive files distributed via trading-related forums such as Forex Station have been used to deliver a variety of malware families such as DarkMe,&nbsp; GuLoader , and&nbsp; Remcos RAT . "After infecting devices, the cybercriminals withdraw money from broker accounts," Group-IB malware analyst Andrey Polovinkin&nbsp; said , adding as many as 130 traders' devices have been compromised as part of the campaign.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented threat cluster has been linked to a software supply chain attack targeting organizations primarily located in Hong Kong and other regions in Asia. The Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, is tracking the activity under its insect-themed moniker Carderbee. The attacks, per the cybersecurity firm, leverage a trojanized version of a legitimate software called EsafeNet Cobra DocGuard Client to deliver a known backdoor called&nbsp; PlugX &nbsp;(aka Korplug) on victim networks. "In the course of this attack, the attackers used malware signed with a legitimate Microsoft certificate," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The use of Cobra DocGuard Client to pull off a supply chain attack was previously highlighted by ESET in its&nbsp; quarterly Threat Report &nbsp;this year, detailing a September 2022 intrusion in which an unnamed gambling company in Hong Kong was compromised via a malicious update pushed by the software.

New LABRAT Campaign Exploits GitLab Flaw for Cryptojacking and Proxyjacking Activities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-labrat-campaign-exploits-gitlab.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new, financially motivated operation dubbed&nbsp; LABRAT &nbsp;has been observed weaponizing a now-patched critical flaw in GitLab as part of a cryptojacking and proxyjacking campaign. "The attacker utilized undetected signature-based tools, sophisticated and stealthy cross-platform malware, command-and-control (C2) tools which bypassed firewalls, and kernel-based rootkits to hide their presence," Sysdig&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Furthermore, the attacker abused a legitimate service,&nbsp; TryCloudflare , to obfuscate their C2 network." Proxyjacking &nbsp;allows the attacker to rent the compromised host out to a proxy network, making it possible to monetize the unused bandwidth. Cryptojacking, on the other hand, refers to the abuse of the system resources to mine cryptocurrency. A notable aspect of the campaign is the use of compiled binaries written in Go and .NET to fly under the radar, with LABRAT also providing backdoor access to the infected systems.

Germany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) has warned of cyber attacks targeting Iranian persons and organizations in the country since the end of 2022. "The cyber attacks were mainly directed against dissident organizations and individuals – such as lawyers, journalists, or human rights activists – inside and outside Iran," the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. The intrusions have been attributed to a threat actor called&nbsp; Charming Kitten , which is also tracked under the names APT35, Mint Sandstorm, TA453 and Yellow Garuda. While Iranian nation-state actors lag behind their Russian and Chinese counterparts in sophistication, they have demonstrated a continued advancement of tools and techniques, adding an arsenal of custom malware to facilitate information gathering and rapidly exploiting n-day security flaws to obtain initial access.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hitherto undocumented threat actor operating for nearly a decade and codenamed&nbsp; MoustachedBouncer has been attributed to cyber espionage attacks aimed at foreign embassies in Belarus. "Since 2020, MoustachedBouncer has most likely been able to perform adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks at the ISP level, within Belarus, in order to compromise its targets," ESET security researcher Matthieu Faou&nbsp; said , describing the group as skilled and advanced. The adversary, active since at least 2014, is assessed to be aligned with Belarusian interests, likely employing a lawful interception system such as&nbsp; SORM &nbsp;to conduct its AitM attacks as well as deploy disparate tools called NightClub and Disco. Both the Windows malware frameworks support additional spying plugins including a screenshotter, an audio recorder, and a file stealer. The oldest sample of NightClub dates back to November 19, 2014, when it was uploaded to VirusTotal from Ukraine. Embassy staff from four differ

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been linked to a cyber attack on a power generation company in southern Africa with a new variant of the SystemBC malware called DroxiDat as a precursor to a suspected ransomware attack. "The proxy-capable backdoor was deployed alongside Cobalt Strike Beacons in a south African nation's critical infrastructure," Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT),&nbsp; said . The Russian cybersecurity company said the attack, which took place in late March 2023, was in its early stages and involved the use of DroxiDat to profile the system and proxy network traffic using the&nbsp; SOCKS5 protocol &nbsp;to and from command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. SystemBC &nbsp;is a C/C++-based commodity malware and remote administrative tool that was&nbsp; first seen in 2019 . Its main feature is to set up&nbsp; SOCKS5 proxies &nbsp;on victim computers that can then be used by threat actors to tunnel malicious traffic associ

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors are using a legitimate Rust-based injector called&nbsp; Freeze[.]rs &nbsp;to deploy a commodity malware called XWorm in victim environments. The novel attack chain, detected by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs on July 13, 2023, is initiated via a phishing email containing a booby-trapped PDF file. It has also been used to introduce Remcos RAT by means of a crypter called SYK Crypter, which was first documented by Morphisec in May 2022. "This file redirects to an HTML file and utilizes the 'search-ms' protocol to access an LNK file on a remote server," security researcher Cara Lin&nbsp; said . "Upon clicking the LNK file, a PowerShell script executes Freeze[.]rs and SYK Crypter for further offensive actions." Freeze[.]rs, released on May 4, 2023, is a&nbsp; open-source red teaming tool &nbsp;from Optiv that functions as a payload creation tool used for circumventing security solutions and executing shellcode in a stealthy manner.

European Bank Customers Targeted in SpyNote Android Trojan Campaign<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/european-bank-customers-targeted-in.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Various European customers of different banks are being targeted by an Android banking trojan called&nbsp; SpyNote &nbsp;as part of an aggressive campaign detected in June and July 2023. "The spyware is distributed through email phishing or smishing campaigns and the fraudulent activities are executed with a combination of remote access trojan (RAT) capabilities and vishing attack," Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical analysis released Monday. SpyNote , also called SpyMax, is similar to other Android banking Trojans in that it requires&nbsp; Android's accessibility permissions &nbsp;in order to grant itself other necessary permissions and gather sensitive data from infected devices. What makes the malware strain notable is its dual functions as spyware and perform bank fraud. The attack chains commence with a bogus SMS message urging users to install a banking app by clicking on the accompanying link, redirecting the victim to the legitimate TeamViewer QuickSupport a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the hacking crew known as Patchwork have been spotted targeting universities and research organizations in China as part of a recently observed campaign. The activity, according to&nbsp; KnownSec 404 Team , entailed the use of a backdoor codenamed&nbsp; EyeShell . Patchwork , also known by the names Operation Hangover and Zinc Emerson, is suspected to be a threat group that operates on behalf of India. Active since at least December 2015, attack chains mounted by the outfit have a narrow focus and tend to single out Pakistan and China with custom implants such as BADNEWS via spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. The adversarial collective has been found to share tactical overlaps with other cyber-espionage groups with an Indian connection, including&nbsp; SideWinder &nbsp;and the&nbsp; DoNot Team . Earlier this May, Meta&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;that it took down 50 accounts on Facebook and Instagram operated by Patchwork, which took advantage of rogue messaging apps uploaded to the

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A legitimate Windows search feature is being exploited by malicious actors to download arbitrary payloads from remote servers and compromise targeted systems with remote access trojans such as AsyncRAT and Remcos RAT. The novel attack technique, per Trellix, takes advantage of the " search-ms: " URI protocol handler, which offers the ability for applications and HTML links to launch custom local searches on a device, and the " search: " application protocol, a mechanism for calling the desktop search application on Windows. "Attackers are directing users to websites that exploit the 'search-ms' functionality using JavaScript hosted on the page," security researchers Mathanraj Thangaraju and Sijo Jacob&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday write-up. "This technique has even been extended to HTML attachments, expanding the attack surface."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Russian nation-state actor known as&nbsp; BlueBravo &nbsp;has been observed targeting diplomatic entities throughout Eastern Europe with the goal of delivering a new backdoor called GraphicalProton, exemplifying the continuous evolution of the threat. The phishing campaign is characterized by the use of legitimate internet services (LIS) for command-and-control (C2) obfuscation, Recorded Future said in a new report published Thursday. The activity was observed between March and May 2023. BlueBravo , also known by the names APT29, Cloaked Ursa, and Midnight Blizzard (formerly Nobelium), is attributed to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and has in the past&nbsp; used &nbsp;Dropbox, Firebase, Google Drive, Notion, and Trello to evade detection and stealthily establish communications with infected hosts. To that end, GraphicalProton is the latest addition to a long list of malware targeting diplomatic organizations after&nbsp; GraphicalNeutrino &nbsp;(aka SNOWYAMBER),&nbsp; HALFRIG, and QUARTERRIG .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Misconfigured and poorly secured Apache Tomcat servers are being targeted as part of a new campaign designed to deliver the&nbsp; Mirai botnet malware &nbsp;and cryptocurrency miners. The findings come courtesy of Aqua, which detected more than 800 attacks against its Tomcat server honeypots over a two-year time period, with 96% of the attacks linked to the Mirai botnet. Of these attack attempts, 20% (or 152) entailed the use of a web shell script dubbed "neww" that originated from 24 unique IP addresses, with 68% of them originating from a single IP address (104.248.157[.]218). "The threat actor scanned for Tomcat servers and launched a brute force attack against it, attempting to gain access to the Tomcat web application manager by trying different combinations of credentials associated with it," Aqua security researcher Nitzan Yaakov&nbsp; said .

Cybersecurity researchers said they have discovered what they say is the first open-source software supply chain attacks specifically targeting the banking sector. "These attacks showcased advanced techniques, including targeting specific components in web assets of the victim bank by attaching malicious functionalities to it," Checkmarx&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "The attackers employed deceptive tactics such as creating a fake LinkedIn profile to appear credible and customized command-and-control (C2) centers for each target, exploiting legitimate services for illicit activities." The npm packages have since been reported and taken down. The names of the packages were not disclosed. In the first attack, the malware author is said to have uploaded a couple of packages to the npm registry in early April 2023 by posing as an employee of the target bank.

The recent attack against&nbsp; Microsoft's email infrastructure &nbsp;by a Chinese nation-state actor referred to as Storm-0558 is said to have a broader scope than previously thought. According to cloud security company Wiz, the inactive Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key used to forge Azure Active Directory (Azure AD or AAD) tokens to gain illicit access to Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Outlook.com could also have allowed the adversary to forge access tokens for various types of Azure AD applications. This&nbsp; includes &nbsp;every application that supports personal account authentication, such as OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams; customers applications that support the "Login with Microsoft functionality," and multi-tenant applications in certain conditions. "Everything in the world of Microsoft leverages Azure Active Directory auth tokens for access," Ami Luttwak, chief technology officer and co-founder of Wiz, said in a statement.

Microsoft Thwarts Chinese Cyber Attack Targeting Western European Governments<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/microsoft-thwarts-chinese-cyber-attack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Tuesday&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that it repelled a cyber attack staged by a Chinese nation-state actor targeting two dozen organizations, some of which include government agencies, in a cyber espionage campaign designed to acquire confidential data. The attacks, which commenced on May 15, 2023, entailed access to email accounts affecting approximately 25 entities and a small number of related individual consumer accounts. The tech giant attributed the campaign to Storm-0558, describing it as a nation-state activity group based out of China that primarily singles out government agencies in Western Europe. "They focus on espionage, data theft, and credential access," Microsoft&nbsp; said . "They are also known to use custom malware that Microsoft tracks as Cigril and Bling, for credential access." The breach is said to have been detected a month later on June 16, 2023, after an unidentified customer reported the anomalous email activity to the company. Microsoft sai

The threat actors behind the RomCom RAT have been suspected of phishing attacks targeting the&nbsp; upcoming NATO Summit &nbsp;in Vilnius as well as an identified organization supporting Ukraine abroad. The findings come from the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team, which&nbsp; found &nbsp;two malicious documents submitted from a Hungarian IP address on July 4, 2023. RomCom, also tracked under the names Tropical Scorpius, UNC2596, and Void Rabisu, was recently observed staging cyber attacks against politicians in Ukraine who are working closely with Western countries and a U.S.-based healthcare organization involved with aiding refugees fleeing the war-torn country. Attack chains mounted by the group are geopolitically motivated and have employed spear-phishing emails to point victims to cloned websites hosting trojanized versions of popular software. Targets include militaries, food supply chains, and IT companies. The latest lure documents identified by BlackBerry impersonate Ukrainia

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed an attack infrastructure that's being used as part of a "potentially massive campaign" against cloud-native environments. "This infrastructure is in early stages of testing and deployment, and is mainly consistent of an aggressive cloud worm, designed to deploy on exposed JupyterLab and Docker APIs in order to deploy&nbsp; Tsunami malware , cloud credentials hijack, resource hijack, and further infestation of the worm," cloud security firm Aqua&nbsp; said . The activity, dubbed&nbsp; Silentbob &nbsp;in reference to an AnonDNS domain set up by the attacker, is said to be linked to the infamous cryptojacking group tracked as&nbsp; TeamTNT , citing overlaps in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). However, the involvement of an "advanced copycat" hasn't been ruled out. Aqua's investigation was prompted in the aftermath of an attack targeting its honeypot in early June 2023, leading to the discovery of four malicious cont

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new ongoing campaign aimed at the npm&nbsp;ecosystem that leverages a unique execution chain to deliver an unknown payload to targeted systems. "The packages in question seem to be published in pairs, each pair working in unison to fetch additional resources which are subsequently decoded and/or executed," software supply chain security firm Phylum&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report released last week. To that end, the order in which the pair of packages are installed is paramount to pulling off a successful attack, as the first of the two modules are designed to store locally a token retrieved from a remote server. The campaign was first discovered on June 11, 2023. The second package subsequently passes this token as a parameter alongside the operating system type to an&nbsp; HTTP GET request &nbsp;to acquire a second script from the remote server. A successful execution returns a Base64-encoded string that is immediately executed but only if that string is

Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Falls Victim to JokerSpy macOS Backdoor Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/japanese-cryptocurrency-exchange-falls.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown cryptocurrency exchange located in Japan was the target of a new attack earlier this month to deploy an Apple macOS backdoor called JokerSpy. Elastic Security Labs, which is monitoring the intrusion set under the name&nbsp; REF9134 ,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the attack led to the installation of Swiftbelt, a Swift-based enumeration tool inspired by an open-source utility called&nbsp; SeatBelt . JokerSky was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Bitdefender last week, describing it as a sophisticated toolkit designed to breach macOS machines. Very little is known about the threat actor behind the operation other than the fact that the attacks leverage a set of programs written in Python and Swift that come with capabilities to gather data and execute arbitrary commands on compromised hosts. A primary component of the toolkit is a self-signed multi-architecture binary known as xcc that's engineered to check for FullDiskAccess and ScreenRecording permissions. The file is signed as XProtectCheck, indicating an

Microsoft Warns of Widescale Credential Stealing Attacks by Russian Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/microsoft-warns-of-widescale-credential.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has disclosed that it's detected a spike in credential-stealing attacks conducted by the Russian state-affiliated hacker group known as Midnight Blizzard. The intrusions, which made use of residential proxy services to obfuscate the source IP address of the attacks, target governments, IT service providers, NGOs, defense, and critical manufacturing sectors, the tech giant's threat intelligence team said. Midnight Blizzard, formerly known as Nobelium , is also tracked under the monikers APT29, Cozy Bear, Iron Hemlock, and The Dukes. The&nbsp; group , which drew worldwide attention for the SolarWinds supply chain compromise in December 2020, has&nbsp; continued &nbsp;to rely on&nbsp; unseen tooling &nbsp;in its targeted attacks aimed at foreign ministries and diplomatic entities. It's a sign of how determined they are to keep their operations up and running despite being exposed, which makes them a particularly formidable actor in the espionage area.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A highly targeted cyber attack against an East Asian IT company involved the deployment of a custom malware written in Golang called&nbsp; RDStealer . "The operation was active for more than a year with the end goal of compromising credentials and data exfiltration," Bitdefender security researcher Victor Vrabie&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. Evidence gathered by the Romanian cybersecurity firm shows that the campaign started in early 2022. The target was an unspecified IT company located in East Asia. In the early phases, the operation relied on readily available remote access trojans like AsyncRAT and Cobalt Strike, before transitioning to bespoke malware in late 2021 or early 2022 in a bid to thwart detection. A primary evasion tactic concerns the use of Microsoft Windows folders that are likely to be excluded from scanning by security software (e.g., System32 and Program Files) to store the backdoor payloads.

New Supply Chain Attack Exploits Abandoned S3 Buckets to Distribute Malicious Binaries<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-supply-chain-attack-exploits.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's a new kind of software supply chain attack aimed at open source projects, it has emerged that threat actors could seize control of expired Amazon S3 buckets to serve rogue binaries without altering the modules themselves. "Malicious binaries steal the user IDs, passwords, local machine environment variables, and local host name, and then exfiltrates the stolen data to the hijacked bucket," Checkmarx researcher Guy Nachshon said. The attack was first observed in the case of an npm package called&nbsp; bignum , which, until version 0.13.0, relied on an Amazon S3 bucket to download pre-built binary versions of an addon named node-pre-gyp during installation. "These binaries were published on a now-expired S3 bucket which has since been claimed by a malicious third party which is now serving binaries containing malware that exfiltrates data from the user's computer," according to a&nbsp; GitHub advisory &nbsp;published on May 24, 2023.

"Dozens" of organizations across the world have been targeted as part of a broad business email compromise ( BEC ) campaign that involved the use of adversary-in-the-middle ( AitM ) techniques to carry out the attacks. "Following a successful phishing attempt, the threat actor gained initial access to one of the victim employee's account and executed an 'adversary-in-the-middle' attack to bypass Office365 authentication and gain persistence access to that account," Sygnia researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Once gaining persistence, the threat actor exfiltrated data from the compromised account and used his access to spread the phishing attacks against other victim's employees along with several external targeted organizations." The findings come less than a week after Microsoft&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;a similar combination of an AitM phishing and a BEC attack aimed at banking and financial services organizations. BEC scam

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korean nation-state threat actor known as&nbsp; Kimsuky &nbsp;has been linked to a social engineering campaign targeting experts in North Korean affairs with the goal of stealing Google credentials and delivering reconnaissance malware. "Further, Kimsuky's objective extends to the theft of subscription credentials from NK News," cybersecurity firm SentinelOne&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "To achieve this, the group distributes emails that lure targeted individuals to log in on the malicious website nknews[.]pro, which masquerades as the authentic NK News site. The login form that is presented to the target is designed to capture entered credentials." NK News , established in 2011, is an American subscription-based news website that provides stories and analysis about North Korea. The disclosure comes days after U.S. and South Korean intelligence agencies&nbsp; issued an alert &nbsp;warning of Kimsuky's use of social engineering tactics to strik

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Brazilian threat actor is targeting more than 30 Portuguese financial institutions with information-stealing malware as part of a long-running campaign that commenced in 2021. "The attackers can steal credentials and exfiltrate users' data and personal information, which can be leveraged for malicious activities beyond financial gain," SentinelOne researchers Aleksandar Milenkoski and Tom Hegel&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity firm, which began tracking "Operation Magalenha" earlier this year, said the intrusions culminate in the deployment of two variants of a backdoor called&nbsp; PeepingTitle &nbsp;so as to "maximize attack potency." The links to Brazil stem from the use of the Brazilian-Portuguese language within the detected artifacts as well as source code overlaps with another banking trojan known as&nbsp; Maxtrilha , which was first disclosed in September 2021. PeepingTitle, like Maxtrilha, is written in the Delphi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
At least eight websites associated with shipping, logistics, and financial services companies in Israel were targeted as part of a watering hole attack. Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity company ClearSky attributed the attacks with low confidence to an Iranian threat actor tracked as&nbsp; Tortoiseshell , which is also called Crimson Sandstorm (previously Curium), Imperial Kitten, and TA456. "The infected sites collect preliminary user information through a script," ClearSky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published Tuesday. Most of the impacted websites have been stripped of the rogue code. Tortoiseshell &nbsp;is known to be active since at least July 2018, with&nbsp; early attacks &nbsp;targeting IT providers in Saudi Arabia. It has also been observed&nbsp; setting up fake hiring websites &nbsp;for U.S. military veterans in a bid to trick them into downloading remote access trojans.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has warned of cyber attacks targeting state bodies in the country as part of an espionage campaign. The&nbsp; intrusion set , attributed to a threat actor tracked by the authority as UAC-0063 since 2021, leverages phishing lures to deploy a variety of malicious tools on infected systems. The origins of the hacking crew are presently unknown. In the attack chain described by the agency, the emails targeted an unspecified ministry and purported to be from the Embassy of Tajikistan in Ukraine. It's suspected that the messages were sent from a previously compromised mailbox. The emails come attached with a Microsoft Word document that, upon enabling macros, launches an encoded VBScript called HATVIBE, which is then used to drop additional malware. This includes a keylogger (LOGPIE), a Python-based backdoor capable of running commands sent from a remote server (CHERRYSPY), and a tool focused on exfiltrating files with specific e

The attacks, which have targeted a variety of sectors in the region, are mainly designed to deliver malware and steal sensitive information, the cybersecurity firm said, adding it detected a four-fold jump in the volume of malicious emails between April 7 and April 10, 2023. Some of the most impacted industry verticals during the four-day time period were networking, manufacturing, and logistics.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government, aviation, education, and telecom sectors located in South and Southeast Asia have come under the radar of a new hacking group as part of a highly-targeted campaign that commenced in mid-2022 and continued into the first quarter of 2023. Symantec, by Broadcom Software, is tracking the activity under its insect-themed moniker&nbsp; Lancefly , with the attacks making use of a "powerful" backdoor called Merdoor. Evidence gathered so far points to the custom implant being utilized as far back as 2018. The ultimate goal of the campaign, based on the tools and the victimology pattern, is assessed to be intelligence gathering. "The backdoor is used very selectively, appearing on just a handful of networks and a small number of machines over the years, with its use appearing to be highly targeted," Symantec&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis shared with The Hacker News. "The attackers in this campaign also have access to an updated version of the ZXShell rootkit."

Bl00dy Ransomware Gang Strikes Education Sector with Critical PaperCut Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/bl00dy-ransomware-gang-strikes.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have warned of attacks carried out by a threat actor known as the&nbsp; Bl00dy Ransomware Gang &nbsp;that attempt to exploit vulnerable PaperCut servers against the education facilities sector in the country. The attacks took place in early May 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in a joint cybersecurity advisory issued Thursday. "The Bl00dy Ransomware Gang gained access to victim networks across the Education Facilities Subsector where PaperCut servers vulnerable to&nbsp; CVE-2023-27350 &nbsp;were exposed to the internet," the agencies&nbsp; said . "Ultimately, some of these operations led to data exfiltration and encryption of victim systems. The Bl00dy Ransomware Gang left ransom notes on victim systems demanding payment in exchange for decryption of encrypted files." CVE-2023-27350 is a now-patched critical security flaw affecting some versions of PaperCut MF a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Iranian nation-state groups have now joined financially motivated actors in actively exploiting a critical flaw in PaperCut print management software, Microsoft disclosed over the weekend. The tech giant's threat intelligence team said it observed both Mango Sandstorm (Mercury) and Mint Sandstorm (Phosphorus) weaponizing CVE-2023-27350 in their operations to achieve initial access. "This activity shows Mint Sandstorm's continued ability to&nbsp; rapidly incorporate [proof-of-concept] exploits &nbsp;into their operations," Microsoft&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets. On the other hand, CVE-2023-27350 exploitation activity associated with Mango Sandstorm is said to be on the lower end of the spectrum, with the state-sponsored group "using tools from prior intrusions to connect to their C2 infrastructure." It's worth noting that&nbsp; Mango Sandstorm &nbsp;is linked to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and&nbsp; Mint Sandstorm &nbsp;is associated with the Islamic

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing phishing campaign with invoice-themed lures is being used to distribute the SmokeLoader malware in the form of a polyglot file, according to the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA). The emails, per the&nbsp; agency , are sent using compromised accounts and come with a ZIP archive that, in reality, is a&nbsp; polyglot file &nbsp;containing a decoy document and a JavaScript file. The JavaScript code is then used to launch an executable that paves for the execution of the&nbsp; SmokeLoader malware . SmokeLoader, first detected in 2011, is a&nbsp; loader &nbsp;whose main objective is to download or load a stealthier or more effective malware onto infected systems. CERT-UA attributed the activity to a threat actor it calls UAC-0006 and characterized it as a financially motivated operation carried out with the goal of stealing credentials and making unauthorized fund transfers.

Meta said it took steps to take down more than 1,000 malicious URLs from being shared across its services that were found to leverage OpenAI's ChatGPT as a lure to propagate about 10 malware families since March 2023. The development comes&nbsp; against &nbsp;the backdrop of&nbsp; fake ChatGPT &nbsp; web browser extensions &nbsp;being increasingly used to steal users' Facebook account credentials with an aim to run unauthorized ads from hijacked business accounts. "Threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools," Meta&nbsp; said . "They would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware." The social media giant said it has blocked several iterations of a multi-pronged malware campaign dubbed&nbsp; Ducktail &nbsp;over the years, adding it issued a cease and desist letter to individuals behind the operation who are located in Vietna

South Korean education, construction, diplomatic, and political institutions are at the receiving end of new attacks perpetrated by a China-aligned threat actor known as the&nbsp; Tonto Team . "Recent cases have revealed that the group is using a file related to anti-malware products to ultimately execute their malicious attacks," the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. Tonto Team, active since at least 2009, has a track record of targeting various sectors across Asia and Eastern Europe. Earlier this year, the group was&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;to an unsuccessful phishing attack on cybersecurity company Group-IB. The attack sequence discovered by ASEC starts with a Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (.CHM) file that executes a binary file to side-load a malicious DLL file (slc.dll) and launch&nbsp; ReVBShell , an open source VBScript backdoor also put to use by another Chinese threat actor called&nbsp; Tick .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A little-known Russian-speaking cyber-espionage group has been linked to a new politically-motivated surveillance campaign targeting high-ranking government officials, telecom services, and public service infrastructures in Tajikistan. The intrusion set, dubbed&nbsp; Paperbug &nbsp;by Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT, has been attributed to a threat actor known as&nbsp; Nomadic Octopus &nbsp;(aka DustSquad). "The types of compromised machines range from individuals' computers to [operational technology] devices," PRODAFT said in a deep dive technical report shared with The Hacker News. "These targets make operation 'Paperbug' intelligence-driven." The ultimate motive behind the attacks is unclear at this stage, but the cybersecurity firm has raised the possibility that it could be the work of opposition forces within the country or, alternatively, an intelligence-gathering mission carried out by Russia or China.

An Iranian nation-state threat actor has been linked to a new wave of phishing attacks targeting Israel that's designed to deploy an updated version of a Windows backdoor called PowerLess . Cybersecurity firm Check Point is tracking the activity cluster under its mythical creature handle&nbsp; Educated Manticore , which exhibits "strong overlaps" with a hacking crew known as APT35, Charming Kitten, Cobalt Illusion, ITG18, Mint Sandstorm (formerly Phosphorus), TA453, and Yellow Garuda. "Like many other actors, Educated Manticore has adopted recent trends and started using ISO images and possibly other archive files to initiate infection chains," the Israeli company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published today. Active since at least 2011, APT35 has cast a&nbsp; wide net of targets &nbsp;by leveraging&nbsp; fake social media personas ,&nbsp; spear-phishing techniques , and&nbsp; N-day vulnerabilities in internet-exposed applications &nbsp;to gain initial access and drop various payloads, includi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Lazarus, the prolific North Korean hacking group behind the cascading&nbsp; supply chain attack targeting 3CX , also breached two critical infrastructure organizations in the power and energy sector and two other businesses involved in financial trading using the trojanized X_TRADER application. The new findings, which come courtesy of&nbsp; Symantec's Threat Hunter Team , confirm earlier suspicions that the X_TRADER application compromise affected more organizations than 3CX. The names of the organizations were not revealed. Eric Chien, director of security response at Broadcom-owned Symantec, told The Hacker News in a statement that the attacks took place between September 2022 and November 2022. "The impact from these infections is unknown at this time – more investigation is required and is on-going," Chien said, adding it's possible that there's "likely more to this story and possibly even other packages that are trojanized."

N.K. Hackers Employ Matryoshka Doll-Style Cascading Supply Chain Attack on 3CX<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/nk-hackers-employ-matryoshka-doll-style.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The supply chain attack targeting 3CX was the result of a prior supply chain compromise associated with a different company, demonstrating a new level of sophistication with North Korean threat actors. Google-owned Mandiant, which is&nbsp; tracking &nbsp;the attack event under the moniker&nbsp; UNC4736 ,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the incident marks the first time it has seen a "software supply chain attack lead to another software supply chain attack." The Matryoshka doll-style cascading attack against 3CX first came to light on March 29, 2023, when it&nbsp; emerged &nbsp;that Windows and macOS versions of its communication software were trojanized to deliver a C/C++-based data miner named ICONIC Stealer by means of a downloader, SUDDENICON, that used icon files hosted on GitHub to extract the server containing the stealer. "The malicious application next attempts to steal sensitive information from the victim user's web browser," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&nbsp; said

Daggerfly Cyberattack Campaign Hits African Telecom Services Providers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/daggerfly-cyberattack-campaign-hits.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Telecommunication services providers in Africa are the target of a new campaign orchestrated by a China-linked threat actor at least since November 2022. The intrusions have been pinned on a hacking crew tracked by Symantec as&nbsp; Daggerfly , and which is also tracked by the broader cybersecurity community as Bronze Highland and Evasive Panda. The campaign makes use of "previously unseen plugins from the MgBot malware framework," the cybersecurity company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The attackers were also seen using a&nbsp; PlugX loader &nbsp;and abusing the legitimate AnyDesk remote desktop software." Daggerfly's use of the&nbsp; MgBot loader &nbsp;(aka BLame or MgmBot) was&nbsp; spotlighted &nbsp;by Malwarebytes in July 2020 as part of phishing attacks aimed at Indian government personnel and individuals in Hong Kong. According to a profile published by Secureworks, the threat actor uses spear-phishing as an initial infection vector to drop MgBot as well as other

Blind Eagle Cyber Espionage Group Strikes Again: New Attack Chain Uncovered<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/blind-eagle-cyber-espionage-group.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The cyber espionage actor tracked as&nbsp; Blind Eagle &nbsp;has been linked to a new multi-stage attack chain that leads to the deployment of the NjRAT remote access trojan on compromised systems. "The group is known for using a variety of sophisticated attack techniques, including custom malware, social engineering tactics, and spear-phishing attacks," ThreatMon&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. Blind Eagle, also referred to as APT-C-36, is a suspected Spanish-speaking group that chiefly strikes private and public sector entities in Colombian. Attacks orchestrated by the group have also targeted Ecuador, Chile, and Spain. Infection chains documented by&nbsp; Check Point &nbsp;and&nbsp; BlackBerry &nbsp;this year have revealed the use of spear-phishing lures to deliver commodity malware families like BitRAT, AsyncRAT, and in-memory Python loaders capable of launching a Meterpreter payload. The latest discovery from ThreatMon entails the use of a JavaScript downloader to execute a PowerShell script hosted

Russia-Linked Hackers Launches Espionage Attacks on Foreign Diplomatic Entities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/russia-linked-hackers-launches.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Russia-linked&nbsp; APT29 &nbsp;(aka Cozy Bear) threat actor has been attributed to an ongoing cyber espionage campaign targeting foreign ministries and diplomatic entities located in NATO member states, the European Union, and Africa. According to Poland's Military Counterintelligence Service and the CERT Polska team, the observed activity shares tactical overlaps with a cluster tracked by Microsoft as&nbsp; Nobelium , which is known for its high-profile&nbsp; attack on SolarWinds &nbsp;in 2020. Nobelium's operations have been attributed to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ), an organization that's tasked with protecting "individuals, society, and the state from foreign threats." That said, the campaign represents an evolution of the Kremlin-backed hacking group's tactics, indicating&nbsp; persistent attempts &nbsp;at improving its cyber weaponry to infiltrate victim systems for intelligence gathering.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Enterprise communications service provider 3CX confirmed that the&nbsp; supply chain attack &nbsp;targeting its desktop application for Windows and macOS was the handiwork of a threat actor with North Korean nexus. The findings are the result of an interim assessment conducted by Google-owned Mandiant, whose services were enlisted after the intrusion came to light late last month. The threat intelligence and incident response unit is tracking the activity under its uncategorized moniker&nbsp; UNC4736 . It's worth noting that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has attributed the attack to a Lazarus sub-group dubbed Labyrinth Chollima, citing tactical overlaps. The&nbsp; attack chain , based on analyses from multiple security vendors, entailed the use of DLL side-loading techniques to load an information stealer known as ICONIC Stealer, followed by a second-stage called&nbsp; Gopuram &nbsp;in selective attacks aimed at crypto companies.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Over one million WordPress websites are estimated to have been infected by an ongoing campaign to deploy malware called&nbsp; Balada Injector &nbsp; since 2017 . The massive campaign, per GoDaddy's Sucuri, "leverages all known and recently discovered theme and plugin vulnerabilities" to breach WordPress sites. The attacks are known to play out in waves once every few weeks. "This campaign is easily identified by its preference for&nbsp; String.fromCharCode &nbsp;obfuscation, the use of freshly registered domain names hosting malicious scripts on random subdomains, and by redirects to various scam sites," security researcher Denis Sinegubko&nbsp; said . The websites include&nbsp; fake tech support , fraudulent lottery wins, and rogue CAPTCHA pages urging users to turn on notifications to 'Please Allow to verify, that you are not a robot,' thereby enabling the actors to send spam ads.

The Iranian nation-state group known as&nbsp; MuddyWater &nbsp;has been observed carrying out destructive attacks on hybrid environments under the guise of a ransomware operation.

A North Korean government-backed threat actor has been linked to attacks targeting government and military personnel, think tanks, policy makers, academics, and researchers in South Korea and the U.S. Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) is&nbsp; tracking &nbsp;the cluster under the name&nbsp; ARCHIPELAGO , which it said is a subset of another threat group tracked by Mandiant under the name&nbsp; APT43 .

The priorities of APT43, and by extension ARCHIPELAGO, are said to align with North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), the primary foreign intelligence service, suggesting overlaps with a group broadly known as&nbsp; Kimsuky .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor known as&nbsp; Arid Viper &nbsp;has been observed using refreshed variants of its malware toolkit in its attacks targeting Palestinian entities since September 2022. Symantec, which is tracking the group under its insect-themed moniker Mantis,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the adversary is "going to great lengths to maintain a persistent presence on targeted networks."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The adversary behind the&nbsp; supply chain attack targeting 3CX &nbsp;deployed a second-stage implant specifically singling out a small number of cryptocurrency companies. Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which has been&nbsp; internally tracking &nbsp;the versatile backdoor under the name&nbsp; Gopuram &nbsp;since 2020, said it observed an increase in the number of infections in March 2023 coinciding with the 3CX breach. Gopuram's primary function is to connect to a command-and-control (C2) server and await further instructions that allow the attackers to interact with the victim's file system, create processes, and launch as many as eight in-memory modules. The backdoor's links to North Korea stem from the fact that it "co-existed on victim machines with&nbsp; AppleJeus , a backdoor attributed to the Korean-speaking threat actor Lazarus," detailing an attack on an unnamed crypto firm located in Southeast Asia in 2020.

3CX Desktop App Supply Chain Attack Leaves Millions at Risk - Urgent Update on the Way!<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/3cx-desktop-app-targeted-in-supply.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
3CX said it's&nbsp; working on a software update &nbsp;for its desktop app after multiple cybersecurity vendors sounded the alarm on what appears to be an active supply chain attack that's using digitally signed and rigged installers of the popular voice and video conferencing software to target downstream customers. "The trojanized 3CX desktop app is the first stage in a multi-stage attack chain that pulls ICO files appended with Base64 data from GitHub and ultimately leads to a third-stage infostealer DLL," SentinelOne researchers&nbsp; said . The cybersecurity firm is tracking the activity under the name SmoothOperator , stating the threat actor registered a massive attack infrastructure as far back as February 2022. There are indications that the attack may have commenced around March 22, 2023. 3CX, the company behind 3CXDesktopApp,&nbsp; claims &nbsp;to have more than 600,000 customers and 12 million users in 190 countries, some of which include well-known names like American Expres

Multiple threat actors, including a nation-state group, exploited a critical three-year-old security flaw in Progress Telerik to break into an unnamed federal entity in the U.S. The&nbsp; disclosure &nbsp;comes from a&nbsp; joint advisory &nbsp;issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC).

Large-scale Cyber Attack Hijacks East Asian Websites for Adult Content Redirects<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/large-scale-cyber-attack-hijacks-east.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A widespread malicious cyber operation has hijacked thousands of websites aimed at East Asian audiences to redirect visitors to adult-themed content since early September 2022. The ongoing campaign entails injecting malicious JavaScript code to the hacked websites, often connecting to the target web server using legitimate FTP credentials the threat actor previously obtained via an unknown method. "In many cases, these were highly secure auto-generated FTP credentials which the attacker was somehow able to acquire and leverage for website hijacking," Wiz&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this month. The fact that the breached websites – owned by both small firms and multinational corporations – utilize different tech stacks and hosting service providers has made it difficult to trace a common attack vector, the cloud security company noted. That having said, one of the common denominators between the websites is that a majority of them are either hosted in China or hosted in

KamiKakaBot Malware Used in Latest Dark Pink APT Attacks on Southeast Asian Targets<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/kamikakabot-malware-used-in-latest-dark.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The&nbsp; Dark Pink &nbsp;advanced persistent threat (APT) actor has been linked to a fresh set of attacks targeting government and military entities in Southeast Asian countries with a malware called KamiKakaBot. Dark Pink, also called Saaiwc, was extensively profiled by Group-IB earlier&nbsp;this year, describing its use of custom tools such as TelePowerBot and KamiKakaBot to run arbitrary commands and exfiltrate sensitive information. The threat actor is suspected to be of Asia-Pacific origin and has been active since at least mid-2021, with an increased tempo observed in 2022. "The latest attacks, which took place in February 2023, were almost identical to previous attacks," Dutch cybersecurity company EclecticIQ&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a new report published last week. "The main difference in the February campaign is that the malware's obfuscation routine has improved to better evade anti-malware measures." The attacks play out in the form of social engineering lures that

Sharp Panda Using New Soul Framework Version to Target Southeast Asian Governments<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/sharp-panda-using-new-soul-framework.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
High-profile government entities in Southeast Asia are the target of a cyber espionage campaign undertaken by a Chinese threat actor known as Sharp Panda since late last year. The intrusions are characterized by the use of a new version of the Soul modular framework, marking a departure from the group's attack chains observed in 2021. Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;the "long-running" activities have historically singled out countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Sharp Panda was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by the firm in June 2021, describing it as a "highly-organized operation that placed significant effort into remaining under the radar." Interestingly, the use of the Soul backdoor was&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;by Broadcom's Symantec in October 2021 in connection to an unattributed espionage operation targeting defense, healthcare, and ICT sectors in Southeast Asia.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government entities in Asia-Pacific and North America are being targeted by an unknown threat actor with an off-the-shelf malware downloader known as PureCrypter to deliver an array of information stealers and ransomware. "The PureCrypter campaign uses the domain of a compromised non-profit organization as a command-and-control (C2) to deliver a secondary payload," Menlo Security researcher Abhay Yadav&nbsp; said . The different types of malware propagated using PureCrypter include&nbsp; RedLine Stealer ,&nbsp; Agent Tesla ,&nbsp; Eternity ,&nbsp; Blackmoon &nbsp;(aka&nbsp; KRBanker ), and&nbsp; Philadelphia &nbsp;ransomware. First documented in June 2022, PureCrypter is&nbsp; advertised &nbsp;for sale by its author for $59 for one-month access (or $245 for a one-off lifetime purchase) and is capable of distributing a multitude of malware. In December 2022, PureCoder – the developer behind the program –&nbsp; expanded &nbsp;the slate of offerings to include a logger and information stealer known as PureLogs, which is designed to si

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The&nbsp; PlugX &nbsp;remote access trojan has been observed masquerading as an open source Windows debugger tool called x64dbg in an attempt to circumvent security protections and gain control of a target system. "This file is a legitimate open-source debugger tool for Windows that is generally used to examine kernel-mode and user-mode code, crash dumps, or CPU registers," Trend Micro researchers Buddy Tancio, Jed Valderama, and Catherine Loveria&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. PlugX, also known as&nbsp; Korplug , is a post-exploitation&nbsp; modular implant , which, among other things, is known for its multiple functionalities such as data exfiltration and its ability to use the compromised machine for nefarious purposes. Although first documented a decade ago in 2012, early samples of the malware date as far as February 2008, according to a&nbsp; Trend Micro report &nbsp;at the time. Over the years, PlugX has been used by threat actors with a Chinese nexus as well as cybercrime groups. On

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Russia's cyber attacks against Ukraine surged by 250% in 2022 when compared to two years ago, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Mandiant disclosed in a new joint report. The targeting, which&nbsp; coincided &nbsp;and has&nbsp; since persisted &nbsp;following the country's military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, focused heavily on the Ukrainian government and military entities, alongside critical infrastructure, utilities, public services, and media sectors. Mandiant&nbsp; said &nbsp;it observed, "more destructive cyber attacks in Ukraine during the first four months of 2022 than in the previous eight years with attacks peaking around the start of the invasion." As many as six unique wiper strains – including WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, Industroyer2, and SDelete – have been deployed against Ukrainian networks, suggesting a willingness on the part of Russian threat actors to forgo persistent access.

Cyber Espionage Group Earth Kitsune Deploys WhiskerSpy Backdoor in Latest Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/north-korean-cyber-espionage-group.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The cyber espionage threat actor tracked as&nbsp; Earth Kitsune &nbsp;has been observed deploying a new backdoor called WhiskerSpy as part of a social engineering campaign. Earth Kitsune, active since at least 2019, is&nbsp; known &nbsp;to primarily target individuals interested in North Korea with self-developed malware such as dneSpy and agfSpy. Previously documented intrusions have entailed the use of watering holes that leverage browser exploits in Google Chrome and Internet Explorer to activate the infection chain. The differentiating factor in the latest attacks is a shift to social engineering to trick users into visiting compromised websites related to North Korea, according to a new report from Trend Micro released last week. The cybersecurity company said the website of an unnamed pro-North Korean organization was hacked and modified to distribute the WhiskerSpy implant. The compromise was discovered at the end of last year. "When a targeted visitor tries to watch videos on the websit

The prolific&nbsp; SideWinder &nbsp;group has been attributed as the nation-state actor behind attempted attacks against 61 entities in Afghanistan, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka between June and November 2021. Targets included government, military, law enforcement, banks, and other organizations, according to an&nbsp; exhaustive report &nbsp;published by Group-IB, which also found links between the adversary and two other intrusion sets tracked as Baby Elephant and&nbsp; DoNot Team . SideWinder &nbsp;is also referred to as APT-C-17, Hardcore Nationalist (HN2), Rattlesnake, Razor Tiger, and T-APT4. It's suspected to be of Indian origin, although Kaspersky in 2022 noted that the attribution is no longer deterministic. The&nbsp; group &nbsp;has been linked to&nbsp; no less than 1,000 attacks &nbsp;against government organizations in the Asia-Pacific region since April 2020, according to a report from the Russian cybersecurity firm early last year.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Monday attributed a China-based cyber espionage actor to a set of attacks targeting diplomatic entities in South America. The tech giant's Security Intelligence team is tracking the cluster under the emerging moniker&nbsp; DEV-0147 ,&nbsp; describing &nbsp;the activity as an "expansion of the group's data exfiltration operations that traditionally targeted government agencies and think tanks in Asia and Europe." The threat actor is said to use established hacking tools such as ShadowPad to infiltrate targets and maintain persistent access. ShadowPad, also called PoisonPlug, is a&nbsp; successor &nbsp;to the&nbsp; PlugX remote access trojan &nbsp;and has been widely put to use by Chinese adversarial collectives with links to the Ministry of State Security (MSS) and People's Liberation Army (PLA), per Secureworks. One of the other malicious tools utilized by DEV-0147 is a webpack loader called QuasarLoader , which allows for deploying additional payloads onto the compromised hosts.

Russian Hackers Using Graphiron Malware to Steal Data from Ukraine<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/russian-hackers-using-graphiron-malware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Russia-linked threat actor has been observed deploying a new information-stealing malware in cyber attacks targeting Ukraine. Dubbed Graphiron by Broadcom-owned Symantec, the malware is the handiwork of an espionage group known as&nbsp; Nodaria , which is tracked by the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) as UAC-0056. "The malware is written in Go and is designed to harvest a wide range of information from the infected computer, including system information, credentials, screenshots, and files," the Symantec Threat Hunter Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. Nodaria was&nbsp; first spotlighted &nbsp;by CERT-UA in January 2022, calling attention to the adversary's use of&nbsp; SaintBot and OutSteel malware &nbsp;in spear-phishing attacks targeting government entities. The group, which is said to be active since at least April 2021, has since&nbsp; repeatedly &nbsp; deployed &nbsp;custom backdoors such as&nbsp; GraphSteel and GrimPlant &nbsp;in various campaigns since Russia's

VMware on Monday said it found no evidence that threat actors are leveraging an unknown security flaw, i.e., a zero-day, in its software as part of an&nbsp; ongoing ransomware attack spree &nbsp;worldwide. "Most reports state that End of General Support (EoGS) and/or significantly out-of-date products are being targeted with known vulnerabilities which were previously addressed and disclosed in VMware Security Advisories (VMSAs)," the virtualization services provider&nbsp; said . The company is further recommending users to upgrade to the latest available supported releases of vSphere components to mitigate known issues and&nbsp; disable the OpenSLP service &nbsp;in ESXi. "In 2021, ESXi 7.0 U2c and ESXi 8.0 GA began shipping with the service disabled by default," VMware added.

VMware ESXi hypervisors are the target of a new wave of attacks designed to deploy ransomware on compromised systems. "These attack campaigns appear to exploit CVE-2021-21974, for which a patch has been available since February 23, 2021," the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) of France&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory on Friday. VMware, in its own alert released at the time, described the issue as an&nbsp; OpenSLP &nbsp;heap-overflow vulnerability that could lead to the execution of arbitrary code. "A malicious actor residing within the same network segment as ESXi who has access to port 427 may be able to trigger the heap-overflow issue in OpenSLP service resulting in remote code execution," the virtualization services provider&nbsp; noted . French cloud services provider OVHcloud&nbsp; said &nbsp;the attacks are being detected globally with a specific focus on Europe.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new attack campaign has targeted the gaming and gambling sectors since at least September 2022, just months prior to the&nbsp; ICE London 2023 &nbsp;gaming industry trade fair event that's scheduled next week. Israeli cybersecurity company Security Joes is tracking the activity cluster under the name&nbsp; Ice Breaker , stating the intrusions employ clever social engineering tactics to deploy a JavaScript backdoor. The attack sequence proceeds as follows: The threat actor poses as a customer while initiating a conversation with a support agent of a gaming website and urges the individual on the other end to open a screenshot image hosted on Dropbox. Security Joes said that the threat actor is "well-aware of the fact that the customer service is human-operated." Clicking the malicious link sent in the chat leads to the retrieval of an LNK payload or, alternatively, a VBScript file as a backup option, the former of which is configured to download and run an MSI package containin

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ukraine has come under a fresh cyber onslaught from Russia that involved the deployment of a previously undocumented Golang-based data wiper dubbed&nbsp; SwiftSlicer .

The overwrites are achieved by using randomly generated byte sequences to fill 4,096 byte-length blocks. The intrusion was discovered on January 25, 2023, the Slovak cybersecurity company added.

DevOps platform CircleCI on Friday disclosed that unidentified threat actors compromised an employee's laptop and leveraged malware to steal their two-factor authentication-backed credentials to breach the company's systems and data last month. The CI/CD service CircleCI said the "sophisticated attack" took place on December 16, 2022, and that the malware went undetected by its antivirus software. "The malware was able to execute session cookie theft, enabling them to impersonate the targeted employee in a remote location and then escalate access to a subset of our production systems," Rob Zuber, CircleCI's chief technology officer,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an incident report. Further analysis of the security lapse revealed that the unauthorized third-party pilfered data from a subset of its databases by abusing the elevated permissions granted to the targeted employee.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A zero-day vulnerability in FortiOS SSL-VPN that Fortinet addressed last month was exploited by unknown actors in attacks targeting the government and other large organizations. "The complexity of the exploit suggests an advanced actor and that it is highly targeted at governmental or government-related targets," Fortinet researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post-mortem analysis published this week. The attacks entailed the exploitation of&nbsp; CVE-2022-42475 , a heap-based buffer overflow flaw that could enable an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via specifically crafted requests. The infection chain analyzed by the company shows that the end goal was to deploy a generic Linux implant modified for FortiOS that's equipped to compromise Fortinet's intrusion prevention system ( IPS ) software and establish connections with a remote server to download additional malware and execute commands. Fortinet said it was unable to recover the payloads used in the su

Australian Healthcare Sector Targeted in Latest Gootkit Malware Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/australian-healthcare-sector-targeted.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A wave of Gootkit malware loader attacks has targeted the Australian healthcare sector by leveraging legitimate tools like VLC Media Player. Gootkit , also called Gootloader, is&nbsp; known &nbsp;to&nbsp; employ &nbsp;search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning tactics (aka spamdexing) for initial access. It typically works by compromising and abusing legitimate infrastructure and seeding those sites with common keywords. Like other malware of its kind, Gootkit is capable of stealing data from the browser, performing adversary-in-the-browser (AitB) attacks, keylogging, taking screenshots, and other malicious actions. Trend Micro's&nbsp; new findings &nbsp;reveal that the keywords "hospital," "health," "medical," and "enterprise agreement" have been paired with various city names in Australia,&nbsp;marking the malware's expansion beyond accounting and law firms. The starting point of the cyber assault is to direct users searching for the same keywords to an infected Wo

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware campaign has been observed targeting Italy with phishing emails designed to deploy an information stealer on compromised Windows systems. "The info-stealer malware steals sensitive information like system info, crypto wallet and browser histories, cookies, and credentials of crypto wallets from victim machines," Uptycs security researcher Karthickkumar Kathiresan&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. Details of the campaign were first&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by Milan-based IT services firm SI.net last month. The multi-stage infection sequence commences with an invoice-themed phishing email containing a link that, when clicked, downloads a password-protected ZIP archive file, which harbors two files: A shortcut (.LNK) file and a batch (.BAT) file. Irrespective of which file is launched, the attack chain remains the same, as opening the shortcut file fetches the same batch script designed to install the information stealer payload from a GitHub repository. This is achieved by leveraging

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind the&nbsp; Kinsing &nbsp;cryptojacking operation have been spotted exploiting misconfigured and exposed PostgreSQL servers to obtain initial access to Kubernetes environments. A second initial access vector technique entails the use of vulnerable images, Sunders Bruskin, security researcher at Microsoft Defender for Cloud,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report last week. Kinsing has a&nbsp; storied history &nbsp;of targeting&nbsp; containerized environments , often leveraging misconfigured open Docker daemon API ports as well as abusing newly disclosed exploits to drop cryptocurrency mining software. The threat actor, in the past, has also been discovered&nbsp; employing a rootkit &nbsp;to hide its presence, in addition to terminating and uninstalling competing resource-intensive services and processes. Now according to Microsoft, misconfigurations in&nbsp; PostgreSQL servers &nbsp;have been co-opted by the Kinsing actor to gain an initial foothold, with the company observing a "large amount of clusters" infe

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A South Africa-based threat actor known as Automated Libra has been observed employing CAPTCHA bypass techniques to create GitHub accounts in a programmatic fashion as part of a freejacking campaign dubbed PURPLEURCHIN. The group "primarily targets cloud platforms offering limited-time trials of cloud resources in order to perform their crypto mining operations," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers William Gamazo and Nathaniel Quist&nbsp; said . PURPLEURCHIN first came to light in October 2022 when Sysdig&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;that the adversary created as many as 30 GitHub accounts, 2,000 Heroku accounts, and 900 Buddy accounts to scale its operation. Now according to Unit 42, the cloud threat actor group created three to five GitHub accounts every minute at the height of its activity in November 2022, totally setting up over 130,000 bogus accounts across Heroku, Togglebox, and GitHub. More than 22,000 GitHub accounts are estimated to have been created between September and Novemb

Experts Uncover Two Long-Running Android Spyware Campaigns Targeting Uyghurs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/experts-uncover-two-long-running.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two long-running surveillance campaigns have been found targeting the Uyghur community in China and elsewhere with Android spyware tools designed to harvest sensitive information and track their whereabouts.  This encompasses a previously undocumented malware strain called BadBazaar and updated variants of an espionage artifact dubbed&nbsp; MOONSHINE &nbsp;by researchers from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in September 2019.  "Mobile surveillance tools like BadBazaar and MOONSHINE can be used to track many of the 'pre-criminal' activities, actions considered indicative of religious extremism or separatism by the authorities in Xinjiang," Lookout&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a detailed write-up of the operations.  The BadBazaar campaign, according to the security firm, is said to date as far back as late 2018 and comprise 111 unique apps that masquerade as benign video players, messengers, religious apps, and even TikTok.

Microsoft Blames Russian Hackers for Prestige Ransomware Attacks on Ukraine and Poland<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/microsoft-blames-russian-hackers-for.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Thursday attributed the recent spate of ransomware incidents targeting transportation and logistics sectors in Ukraine and Poland to a threat cluster that shares overlaps with the Russian state-sponsored&nbsp; Sandworm group .  The attacks, which were disclosed by the tech giant last month, involved a strain of previously undocumented malware called&nbsp; Prestige &nbsp;and is said to have taken place within an hour of each other across all victims.  The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) is now tracking the threat actor under its element-themed moniker Iridium (née DEV-0960), citing overlaps with Sandworm (aka Iron Viking, TeleBots, and Voodoo Bear).  "This attribution assessment is based on forensic artifacts, as well as overlaps in victimology, tradecraft, capabilities, and infrastructure, with known Iridium activity," MSTIC&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an update.

Cybersecurity researchers are warning of "massive phishing campaigns" that distribute five different malware targeting banking users in India.  "The bank customers targeted include account subscribers of seven banks, including some of the most well-known banks located in the country and potentially affecting millions of customers," Trend Micro&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week.  Some of the targeted banks include Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, and the State Bank of India (SBI), among others.  The infection chains all have a common entry point in that they rely on SMS messages containing a phishing link that urge potential victims to enter their personal details and credit card information to supposedly get a tax refund or gain credit card reward points.   The smishing attacks, which deliver Elibomi, FakeReward, AxBanker, IcRAT, and IcSpy, are just the latest in a series of similar rewards-themed malware campaigns that have been documented by&nbsp; Microsoft, Cyble , and&nbsp; K

Several Cyber Attacks Observed Leveraging IPFS Decentralized Network<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/several-cyber-attacks-observed.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A number of phishing campaigns are leveraging the decentralized Interplanetary Filesystem (IPFS) network to host malware, phishing kit infrastructure, and facilitate other attacks.  "Multiple malware families are currently being hosted within IPFS and retrieved during the initial stages of malware attacks," Cisco Talos researcher Edmund Brumaghin said in an analysis  shared with The Hacker News.  The research mirrors similar findings from Trustwave SpiderLabs in July 2022, which&nbsp; found &nbsp;more than 3,000 emails containing IPFS phishing URLs as an attack vector, calling IPFS the new "hotbed" for hosting phishing sites.  IPFS as a technology is both resilient to censorship and takedowns, making it a double-edged sword. Underlying it is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network which replicates content across all participating nodes so that even if content is removed from one machine, requests for the resources can still be served via other systems.   This also makes it ripe for abu

An advanced persistent threat (APT) group of Chinese origin codenamed&nbsp; DiceyF &nbsp;has been linked to a string of attacks aimed at online casinos in Southeast Asia for years.

"Possibly we have a mix of espionage and [intellectual property] theft, but the true motivations remain a mystery," researchers Kurt Baumgartner and Georgy Kucherin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published this week.  The starting point of the investigation was in November 2021 when Kaspersky said it detected multiple&nbsp; PlugX loaders &nbsp;and other payloads that were deployed via an employee monitoring service and a security package deployment service.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the notorious Emotet malware are continually shifting their tactics and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to escape detection, according to new research from VMware.  Emotet &nbsp;is the work of a threat actor tracked as Mummy Spider (aka TA542), emerging in June 2014 as a banking trojan before morphing into an all-purpose loader in 2016 that's capable of delivering second-stage payloads such as ransomware.  While the botnet's infrastructure was&nbsp; taken down &nbsp;as part of a coordinated law enforcement operation in January 2021, Emotet bounced back in November 2021 through another malware known as&nbsp; TrickBot .  Emotet's resurrection, orchestrated by the now-defunct Conti team, has since paved the way for Cobalt Strike infections and, more recently, ransomware attacks involving&nbsp; Quantum and BlackCat .   "The ongoing adaptation of Emotet's execution chain is one reason the malware has been successful for so long," researchers from VMwa

Comm100 Chat Provider Hijacked to Spread Malware in Supply Chain Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/comm100-chat-provider-hijacked-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor likely with associations to China has been attributed to a new supply chain attack that involves the use of a trojanized installer for the Comm100 Live Chat application to distribute a JavaScript backdoor.  Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said the attack made use of a signed Comm100 desktop agent app for Windows that was downloadable from the company's website.  The scale of the attack is currently unknown, but the trojanized file is said to have been identified at organizations in the industrial, healthcare, technology, manufacturing, insurance, and telecom sectors in North America and Europe.  Comm100 is a Canadian provider of live audio/video chat and customer engagement software for enterprises. It&nbsp; claims &nbsp;to have more than 15,000 customers across 51 countries.   "The installer was signed on September 26, 2022 at 14:54:00 UTC using a valid Comm100 Network Corporation certificate," the company&nbsp; noted , adding it remained available until September 29.  E

Cyber Attacks Against Middle East Governments Hide Malware in Windows logo<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/cyber-attacks-against-middle-east.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An espionage-focused threat actor has been observed using a steganographic trick to conceal a previously undocumented backdoor in a Windows logo in its attacks against Middle Eastern governments.  Broadcom's Symantec Threat Hunter Team attributed the updated tooling to a hacking group it tracks under the name&nbsp; Witchetty , which is also known as&nbsp; LookingFrog , a subgroup operating under the TA410 umbrella.  Intrusions involving TA410 – which is believed to share connections with a Chinese threat group known as APT10 (aka Cicada, Stone Panda, or TA429) – primarily feature a modular implant called LookBack.   Symantec's latest analysis of attacks between February and September 2022, during which the group targeted the governments of two Middle Eastern countries and the stock exchange of an African nation, highlights the use of a new backdoor called Stegmap.  The new malware leverages&nbsp; steganography &nbsp;– a technique used to embed a message (in this case, malware) in a non-secret doc

New Malware Campaign Targeting Job Seekers with Cobalt Strike Beacons<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/new-malware-campaign-targeting-job.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A social engineering campaign leveraging job-themed lures is weaponizing a years-old remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons on compromised hosts.  "The payload discovered is a leaked version of a Cobalt Strike beacon," Cisco Talos researchers Chetan Raghuprasad and Vanja Svajcer&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new analysis published Wednesday.  "The beacon configuration contains commands to perform targeted process injection of arbitrary binaries and has a high reputation domain configured, exhibiting the redirection technique to masquerade the beacon's traffic."   The malicious activity, discovered in August 2022, attempts to exploit the vulnerability&nbsp; CVE-2017-0199 , a remote code execution issue in Microsoft Office, that allows an attacker to take control of an affected system.  The entry vector for the attack is a phishing email containing a Microsoft Word attachment that employs job-themed lures for roles in the U.S. government and Publ

WARNING: New Unpatched Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day Under Active Exploitation<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/warning-new-unpatched-microsoft.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers are warning of previously undisclosed flaws in fully patched Microsoft Exchange servers being exploited by malicious actors in real-world attacks to achieve remote code execution on affected systems.  That's according to Vietnamese cybersecurity company GTSC, which discovered the shortcomings as part of its security monitoring and incident response efforts in August 2022.  The two vulnerabilities, which are formally yet to be assigned CVE identifiers, are being&nbsp; tracked &nbsp;by the Zero Day Initiative as&nbsp; ZDI-CAN-18333 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8) and&nbsp; ZDI-CAN-18802 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.3).  GTSC said that successful exploitation of the flaws could be abused to gain a foothold in the victim's systems, enabling adversaries to drop web shells and carry out lateral movements across the compromised network.   "We detected web shells, mostly obfuscated, being dropped to Exchange servers," the company&nbsp; noted . "Using the user-agent, we detected that the attacker use

Researchers Uncover Covert Attack Campaign Targeting Military Contractors<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/researchers-uncover-covert-attack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new covert attack campaign singled out multiple military and weapons contractor companies with spear-phishing emails to trigger a multi-stage infection process designed to deploy an unknown payload on compromised machines.  The highly-targeted intrusions, dubbed&nbsp; STEEP#MAVERICK &nbsp;by Securonix, also targeted a strategic supplier to the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft.  "The attack was carried out starting in late summer 2022 targeting at least two high-profile military contractor companies," Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis.   Infection chains begin with a phishing mail with a ZIP archive attachment containing a shortcut file that claims to be a PDF document about "Company &amp; Benefits," which is then used to retrieve a stager -- an initial binary that's used to download the desired malware -- from a remote server.  This PowerShell stager sets the stage for a "robust chain of stagers" that progresses through seven m

Government and state-owned organizations in a number of Asian countries have been targeted by a distinct group of espionage hackers as part of an intelligence gathering mission that has been underway since early 2021.  "A notable feature of these attacks is that the attackers leveraged a wide range of legitimate software packages in order to load their malware payloads using a technique known as&nbsp; DLL side-loading ," the Symantec Threat Hunter team, part of Broadcom Software,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The campaign is said to be exclusively geared towards government institutions related to finance, aerospace, and defense, as well as state-owned media, IT, and telecom firms.&nbsp;  Dynamic-link library (DLL) side-loading is a popular cyberattack method that leverages how Microsoft Windows applications handle DLL files.

Major financial and insurance companies located in French-speaking nations in Africa have been targeted over the past two years as part of a persistent malicious campaign codenamed&nbsp; DangerousSavanna .

"The threat actors' creativity is on display in the initial infection stage, as they persistently pursue the employees of the targeted companies, constantly changing infection chains that utilize a wide range of malicious file types, from self-written executable loader

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The attack infrastructure used to&nbsp; target Cisco &nbsp;in the May 2022 incident was also employed against an attempted compromise of an unnamed workforce management solutions holding company a month earlier in April 2022.  Cybersecurity firm Sentire, which&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;the findings, raised the possibility that the intrusions could be the work of a criminal actor known as mx1r, who is said to be a member of the Evil Corp affiliate cluster dubbed&nbsp; UNC2165 .  Evil Corp, the progenitors of the infamous Dridex banking trojan, have, over the years, refined their modus operandi to run a series of ransomware operations to sidestep sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury in December 2019.   Initial access to the company's IT network was made possible by using stolen Virtual Private Network (VPN) credentials, followed by leveraging off-the-shelf tools for lateral movement and gaining deeper access into the victim's environment.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind a large-scale adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM)&nbsp; phishing campaign &nbsp;targeting enterprise users of Microsoft email services have also set their sights on Google Workspace users.  "This campaign specifically targeted chief executives and other senior members of various organizations which use [Google Workspace]," Zscaler researchers Sudeep Singh and Jagadeeswar Ramanukolanu&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;in a report published this month.   The AiTM phishing attacks are said to have commenced in mid-July 2022, following a similar modus operandi as that of a&nbsp; social engineering campaign &nbsp;designed to siphon users' Microsoft credentials and even bypass multi-factor authentication.  The low-volume Gmail AiTM phishing campaign also entails using the compromised emails of chief executives to conduct further social engineering, with the attacks also utilizing several compromised domains as an intermediate URL redirector to take the victims to the final landing page.

Organizations in the Spanish-speaking nations of Mexico and Spain are in the crosshairs of a new campaign designed to deliver the&nbsp; Grandoreiro &nbsp;banking trojan.&nbsp;  "In this campaign, the threat actors impersonate government officials from the Attorney General's Office of Mexico City and from the Public Ministry in the form of spear-phishing emails in order to lure victims to download and execute 'Grandoreiro,' a prolific banking trojan that has been active since at least 2016, and that specifically targets users in Latin America," Zscaler&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.  The ongoing attacks, which commenced in June 2022, have been observed to target automotive, civil and industrial construction, logistics, and machinery sectors via multiple infection chains in Mexico and chemicals manufacturing industries in Spain.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have elaborated a novel attack technique that weaponizes programmable logic controllers ( PLCs ) to gain an initial foothold in engineering workstations and subsequently invade the operational technology (OT) networks.  Dubbed " Evil PLC " attack by industrial security firm Claroty, the issue impacts engineering workstation software from Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric, GE, B&amp;R, Xinje, OVARRO, and Emerson.  Programmable logic controllers are a crucial component of industrial devices that control manufacturing processes in critical infrastructure sectors. PLCs, besides orchestrating the automation tasks, are also configured to start and stop processes and generate alarms.  It's hence not surprising that the entrenched access provided by PLCs have made the machines a focus of sophisticated attacks for more than a decade, starting from&nbsp; Stuxnet to PIPEDREAM &nbsp;(aka INCONTROLLER), with the goal of causing physical disruptions.&nbsp;   "The

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Russian state-sponsored actors are continuing to strike Ukrainian entities with information-stealing malware as part of what's suspected to be an espionage operation.  Symantec, a division of Broadcom Software,&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the malicious campaign to a threat actor tracked&nbsp; Shuckworm , also known as&nbsp; Actinium ,&nbsp; Armageddon , Gamaredon, Primitive Bear, and Trident Ursa. The findings have been&nbsp; corroborated &nbsp;by the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA).  The threat actor, active since at least 2013, is known for explicitly singling out public and private entities in Ukraine. The attacks have since ratcheted up in the wake of Russia's military invasion in late 2022.   The latest set of attacks are said to have commenced on July 15, 2022, and ongoing as recently as August 8, with the infection chains leveraging phishing emails disguised as newsletters and combat orders, ultimately leading to the deployment of a PowerShell stealer malware dubbed&nbsp; GammaLoad.PS1_v2 .

Threat actors associated with the Cuba ransomware have been linked to previously undocumented tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), including a new remote access trojan called ROMCOM RAT  on compromised systems.

Cuba ransomware (aka&nbsp; COLDDRAW ), which was first detected in December 2019, reemerged on the threat landscape in November 2021 and has been attributed to attacks against 60 entities in five critical infrastructure sectors, amassing at least $43.9 million in ransom payments.  Of the 60 victims listed on its data leak site, 40 are located in the U.S., indicating a not as global distribution of targeted organizations as other ransomware gangs.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The first ever incident possibly involving the ransomware family known as Maui occurred on April 15, 2021, aimed at an unnamed Japanese housing company.  The disclosure from Kaspersky arrives a month after U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies issued an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;about the use of the ransomware strain by North Korean government-backed hackers to target the healthcare sector since at least May 2021.  Much of the data about its modus operandi came from incident response activities and industry analysis of a Maui sample that revealed a lack of "several key features" typically associated with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations.  Not only is Maui designed to be manually executed by a remote actor via a command-line interface, it's also notable for not including a ransom note to provide recovery instructions.   Subsequently, the Justice Department&nbsp; announced &nbsp;the seizure of $500,000 worth of Bitcoin that were extorted from several organizations, including two he

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor working to further Iranian goals is said to have been behind a set of disruptive cyberattacks against Albanian government services in mid-July 2022.  Cybersecurity firm Mandiant&nbsp; said &nbsp;the malicious activity against a NATO state represented a "geographic expansion of Iranian disruptive cyber operations."  The&nbsp; July 17 attacks , according to Albania's National Agency of Information Society, forced the government to "temporarily close access to online public services and other government websites" because of a "synchronized and sophisticated cybercriminal attack from outside Albania."  The politically motivated disruptive operation, per Mandiant, entailed the deployment of a new ransomware family called ROADSWEEP that included a ransom note with the text: "Why should our taxes be spent on the benefit of DURRES terrorists?"   A front named HomeLand Justice has since claimed credit for the cyber offensive, with the group also alle

A Growing Number of Malware Attacks Leveraging Dark Utilities 'C2-as-a-Service'<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/a-growing-number-of-malware-attacks.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A nascent service called Dark Utilities  has already attracted 3,000 users for its ability to provide command-and-control (C2) services with the goal of commandeering compromised systems.  "It is marketed as a means to enable remote access, command execution, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and cryptocurrency mining operations on infected systems," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Dark Utilities, which emerged in early 2022, is advertised as a "C2-as-a-Service" (C2aaS), offering access to infrastructure hosted on the clearnet as well as the TOR network and associated payloads with support for Windows, Linux, and Python-based implementations for a mere €9.99.   Authenticated users on the platform are presented with a dashboard that makes it possible to generate new payloads tailored to a specific operating system that can then be deployed and executed on victim hosts.  Additionally, users are provided an administrative panel

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been targeting Russian entities with a newly discovered remote access trojan called Woody RAT  for at least a year as part of a spear-phishing campaign.  The advanced custom backdoor is said to be delivered via either of two methods: archive files or Microsoft Office documents leveraging the now-patched "Follina" support diagnostic tool vulnerability ( CVE-2022-30190 ) in Windows.  Like other implants engineered for espionage-oriented operations, Woody RAT sports a wide range of features that enables the threat actor to remotely commandeer and steal sensitive information from the infected systems.  "The earliest versions of this RAT were typically archived into a ZIP file pretending to be a document specific to a Russian group," Malwarebytes researchers Ankur Saini and Hossein Jazi&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report.   "When the Follina vulnerability became known to the world, the threat actor switched to it to distribute the payload.&amp;quo

Hackers Exploited Atlassian Confluence Bug to Deploy Ljl Backdoor for Espionage<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/hackers-exploited-atlassian-confluence.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor is said to have "highly likely" exploited a security flaw in an outdated Atlassian Confluence server to deploy a never-before-seen backdoor against an unnamed organization in the research and technical services sector.  The attack, which transpired over a seven-day-period during the end of May, has been attributed to a threat activity cluster tracked by cybersecurity firm Deepwatch as&nbsp; TAC-040 .  "The evidence indicates that the threat actor executed malicious commands with a parent process of tomcat9.exe in Atlassian's Confluence directory," the company&nbsp; said . "After the initial compromise, the threat actor ran various commands to enumerate the local system, network, and Active Directory environment."   The Atlassian vulnerability suspected to have been exploited is&nbsp; CVE-2022-26134 , an Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) injection flaw that paves the way for arbitrary code execution on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance.

A new, large-scale phishing campaign has been observed using adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) techniques to get around security protections and compromise enterprise email accounts.  "It uses an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attack technique capable of bypassing multi-factor authentication," Zscaler researchers Sudeep Singh and Jagadeeswar Ramanukolanu&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. "The campaign is specifically designed to reach end users in enterprises that use Microsoft's email services."  Prominent targets include fintech, lending, insurance, energy, manufacturing, and federal credit union verticals located in the U.S., U.K., New Zealand, and Australia.   This is not the first time such a phishing attack has come to light. Last month, Microsoft&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;that over 10,000 organizations had been targeted since September 2021 by means of AitM techniques to breach accounts secured with multi-factor authentication (MFA).

A large software development company whose software is used by different state entities in Ukraine was at the receiving end of an "uncommon" piece of malware, new research has found.  The malware, first observed on the morning of May 19, 2022, is a custom variant of the open source backdoor known as&nbsp; GoMet &nbsp;and is designed for maintaining persistent access to the network.  "This access could be leveraged in a variety of ways including deeper access or to launch additional attacks, including the potential for software supply chain compromise," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.   Although there are no concrete indicators linking the attack to a single actor or group, the cybersecurity firm's assessment points to Russian nation-state activity.

New Air-Gap Attack Uses SATA Cable as an Antenna to Transfer Radio Signals<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/new-air-gap-attack-uses-sata-cable-as.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new method devised to leak information and jump over air-gaps takes advantage of Serial Advanced Technology Attachment ( SATA ) or Serial ATA cables as a communication medium, adding to a&nbsp; long list &nbsp;of electromagnetic, magnetic, electric, optical, and acoustic methods already demonstrated to plunder data.  "Although air-gap computers have no wireless connectivity, we show that attackers can use the SATA cable as a wireless antenna to transfer radio signals at the 6GHz frequency band," Dr. Mordechai Guri, the head of R&amp;D in the Cyber Security Research Center in the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel,&nbsp; wrote &nbsp;in a paper published last week.  The technique, dubbed&nbsp; SATAn , takes advantage of the prevalence of the computer bus interface, making it "highly available to attackers in a wide range of computer systems and IT environments."  Put simply, the goal is to use the SATA cable as a covert channel to emanate electromagnetic signals and transfer a br

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VoIP phones using Digium's software have been targeted to drop a web shell on their servers as part of an attack campaign designed to exfiltrate data by downloading and executing additional payloads.  "The malware installs multilayer obfuscated PHP backdoors to the web server's file system, downloads new payloads for execution, and schedules recurring tasks to re-infect the host system," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Friday report.  The unusual activity is said to have commenced in mid-December 2021 and targets Asterisk, a widely used software implementation of a private branch exchange (PBX) that runs on the open-source Elastix Unified Communications Server.   Unit 42 said the intrusions share similarities with the&nbsp; INJ3CTOR3 campaign &nbsp;that Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point disclosed in November 2020, alluding to the possibility that they could be a "resurgence" of the previous attacks.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics from the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) has warned of a novel technique that could be used to defeat&nbsp; anonymity protections &nbsp;and identify a unique website visitor.  "An attacker who has complete or partial control over a website can learn whether a specific target (i.e., a unique individual) is browsing the website," the researchers&nbsp; said . "The attacker knows this target only through a public identifier, such as an email address or a Twitter handle."  The cache-based targeted&nbsp; de-anonymization attack &nbsp;is a&nbsp; cross-site leak &nbsp;that involves the adversary leveraging a service such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or YouTube to privately share a resource (e.g., image, video, or a YouTube playlist) with the target, followed by embedding the shared resource into the attack website.  This can be achieved by, say, privately sharing the resource with the target using the victim's email address or the appropriate username associated with the serv

North Korean Hackers Targeting Small and Midsize Businesses with H0lyGh0st Ransomware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/north-korean-hackers-targeting-small.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An emerging threat cluster originating from North Korea has been linked to developing and using ransomware in cyberattacks targeting small businesses since September 2021.  The group, which calls itself H0lyGh0st after the ransomware payload of the same name, is being tracked by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center under the moniker DEV-0530, a designation assigned for unknown, emerging, or a developing group of threat activity.  Targeted entities primarily include small-to-midsize businesses such as manufacturing organizations, banks, schools, and event and meeting planning companies.  "Along with their H0lyGh0st payload, DEV-0530 maintains an .onion site that the group uses to interact with their victims," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday analysis.  "The group's standard methodology is to encrypt all files on the target device and use the file extension .h0lyenc, send the victim a sample of the files as proof, and then demand payment in Bitcoin in exchange

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Nation-state hacking groups aligned with China, Iran, North Korea, and Turkey have been targeting journalists to conduct espionage and spread malware as part of a series of campaigns since early 2021.  "Most commonly, phishing attacks targeting journalists are used for espionage or to gain key insights into the inner workings of another government, company, or other area of state-designated import," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The ultimate goal of the intrusions, the enterprise security firm said, is to gain a competitive intelligence edge or spread disinformation and propaganda.   Proofpoint said it identified two Chinese hacking groups, TA412 (aka&nbsp; Zirconium &nbsp;or Judgment Panda) and&nbsp; TA459 , targeting media personnel with malicious emails containing web beacons and weaponized documents respectively that were used to amass information about the recipients' network environments and drop&nbsp; Chinoxy &nbsp;malware.

The advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as Transparent Tribe  has been attributed to a new ongoing phishing campaign targeting students at various educational institutions in India at least since December 2021.  "This new campaign also suggests that the APT is actively expanding its network of victims to include civilian users," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Also tracked under the monikers APT36, Operation C-Major, PROJECTM, Mythic Leopard, the Transparent Tribe actor is&nbsp; suspected &nbsp;to be of Pakistani origin and is known to strike government entities and think tanks in India and Afghanistan with custom malware such as CrimsonRAT, ObliqueRAT, and CapraRAT.   But the targeting of educational institutions and students, first&nbsp; observed &nbsp;by India-based K7 Labs in May 2022, indicates a deviation from the adversary's typical focus.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's being described as an "unprecedented" twist, the operators of the TrickBot malware have resorted to systematically targeting Ukraine since the onset of the war in late February 2022.  The group is believed to have orchestrated at least six phishing campaigns aimed at targets that align with Russian state interests, with the emails acting as lures for delivering malicious software such as IcedID, CobaltStrike, AnchorMail, and&nbsp; Meterpreter .  Tracked under the names ITG23,&nbsp; Gold Blackburn , and Wizard Spider, the&nbsp; financially motivated cybercrime gang &nbsp;is known for its development of the TrickBot banking trojan and was&nbsp; subsumed &nbsp;into the now-discontinued&nbsp; Conti ransomware cartel &nbsp;earlier this year.

North Korean Maui Ransomware Actively Targeting U.S. Healthcare Organizations<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/north-korean-maui-ransomware-actively.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In a new joint cybersecurity advisory, U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have warned about the use of Maui ransomware by North Korean government-backed hackers to target the healthcare sector since at least May 2021.  "North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors used Maui ransomware in these incidents to encrypt servers responsible for healthcare services—including electronic health records services, diagnostics services, imaging services, and intranet services," the authorities&nbsp; noted .  The&nbsp; alert &nbsp;comes courtesy of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of the Treasury.  Cybersecurity firm Stairwell, whose findings formed the basis of the advisory, said the lesser-known ransomware family stands out because of a lack of several key features commonly associated with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups.   This includes the absence of "embedded ransom note to provide recov

Malicious actors have been observed abusing legitimate adversary simulation software in their attacks in an attempt to stay under the radar and evade detection.  Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said  a&nbsp; malware sample &nbsp;uploaded to the VirusTotal database on May 19, 2022, contained a payload associated with Brute Ratel C4, a relatively new sophisticated toolkit "designed to avoid detection by endpoint detection and response (EDR) and antivirus (AV) capabilities."  Authored by an Indian security researcher named&nbsp; Chetan Nayak , Brute Ratel (BRc4) is analogous to Cobalt Strike and is&nbsp; described &nbsp;as a "customized command-and-control center for red team and adversary simulation."   The commercial software was first released in late 2020 and has since gained over 480 licenses across 350 customers. Each license is offered at $2,500 per user for a year, after which it can be renewed for the same duration at the cost of $2,250.  BRc4 is equipped with a wide variety of features,

A pro-China&nbsp; influence campaign &nbsp;singled out rare earth mining companies in Australia, Canada, and the U.S. with negative messaging in an unsuccessful attempt to manipulate public discourse to China's benefit.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A cloud threat actor group tracked as 8220 has updated its malware toolset to breach Linux servers with the goal of installing crypto miners as part of a long-running campaign.  "The updates include the deployment of new versions of a crypto miner and an IRC bot," Microsoft Security Intelligence said  in a series of tweets on Thursday. "The group has actively updated its techniques and payloads over the last year."  8220, active since early 2017 , is a Chinese-speaking, Monero-mining threat actor so named for its preference to communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers over port 8220. It's also the developer of a tool called whatMiner, which has been co-opted by the Rocke  cybercrime group in their attacks.   In July 2019, the Alibaba Cloud Security Team uncovered  an extra shift in the adversary's tactics, noting its use of rootkits to hide the mining program. Two years later, the gang resurfaced  with Tsunami IRC botnet  variants and a custom "

A suspected ransomware intrusion against an unnamed target leveraged a Mitel VoIP appliance as an entry point to achieve remote code execution and gain initial access to the environment.  The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;come from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which traced the source of the attack to a Linux-based Mitel VoIP device sitting on the network perimeter, while also identifying a previously unknown exploit as well as a couple of anti-forensic measures adopted by the actor on the device to erase traces of their actions.  The exploit in question is tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-29499 &nbsp;and was fixed by Mitel in April 2022. It's rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system, making it a critical shortcoming.

Russian Hackers Exploiting Microsoft Follina Vulnerability Against Ukraine<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/russian-hackers-exploiting-microsoft.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has&nbsp; cautioned &nbsp;of a new set of spear-phishing attacks exploiting the "Follina" flaw in the Windows operating system to deploy password-stealing malware.  Attributing the intrusions to a Russian nation-state group tracked as APT28 (aka Fancy Bear or Sofacy), the agency said the attacks commence with a lure document titled "Nuclear Terrorism A Very Real Threat.rtf" that, when opened, exploits the recently disclosed vulnerability to download and execute a malware called CredoMap.  Follina ( CVE-2022-30190 , CVSS score: 7.8), which concerns a case of remote code execution affecting the Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), was addressed by Microsoft on June 14, 2022, as part of its&nbsp; Patch Tuesday updates .   According to an independent report published by Malwarebytes,&nbsp; CredoMap &nbsp;is a variant of the .NET-based credential stealer that Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG)&nbsp; divulged &nbsp;last month as having been depl

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new kind of Windows NTLM relay attack dubbed&nbsp; DFSCoerce &nbsp;has been uncovered that leverages the Distributed File System (DFS): Namespace Management Protocol (MS-DFSNM) to seize control of a domain.  "Spooler service disabled, RPC filters installed to prevent PetitPotam and File Server VSS Agent Service not installed but you still want to relay [Domain Controller authentication to [Active Directory Certificate Services]? Don't worry MS-DFSNM have (sic) your back," security researcher Filip Dragovic&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a tweet.   MS-DFSNM &nbsp;provides a remote procedure call (RPC) interface for administering distributed file system configurations.  The NTLM (NT Lan Manager) relay attack is a well-known method that exploits the challenge-response mechanism. It allows malicious parties to sit between clients and servers and intercept and relay validated authentication requests in order to gain unauthorized access to network resources, effectively gaining an initial foothold in Active Di

A sophisticated Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) actor exploited a critical security vulnerability in Sophos' firewall product that came to light earlier this year to infiltrate an unnamed South Asian target as part of a highly-targeted attack.  "The attacker implement[ed] an interesting web shell backdoor, create[d] a secondary form of persistence, and ultimately launch[ed] attacks against the customer's staff," Volexity&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "These attacks aimed to further breach cloud-hosted web servers hosting the organization's public-facing websites."  The zero-day flaw in question is tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-1040 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), and concerns an authentication bypass vulnerability that can be weaponized to execute arbitrary code remotely. It affects Sophos Firewall versions 18.5 MR3 (18.5.3) and earlier.

Chinese 'Gallium' Hackers Using New PingPull Malware in Cyberespionage Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/chinese-gallium-hackers-using-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Gallium has been observed using a previously undocumented remote access trojan in its espionage attacks targeting companies operating in Southeast Asia, Europe, and Africa.  Called&nbsp; PingPull , the "difficult-to-detect" backdoor is notable for its use of the Internet Control Message Protocol ( ICMP ) for command-and-control (C2) communications, according to new research published by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 today.   Gallium is known for its attacks primarily aimed at telecom companies dating as far back as 2012. Also tracked under the name&nbsp; Soft Cell &nbsp;by Cybereason, the state-sponsored actor has been&nbsp; connected &nbsp;to a broader set of attacks targeting five major telecom companies located in Southeast Asian countries since 2017.  Over the past year, however, the group is said to have expanded its victimology footprint to include financial institutions and government entities located in Afghanistan, Australia, Belgium, Cambodi

Iranian Hackers Spotted Using a new DNS Hijacking Malware in Recent Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/iranian-hackers-spotted-using-new-dns.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian state-sponsored threat actor tracked under the moniker Lyceum has turned to using a new custom .NET-based backdoor in recent campaigns directed against the Middle East.  "The new malware is a .NET based DNS Backdoor which is a customized version of the open source tool 'DIG.net,'" Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Niraj Shivtarkar and Avinash Kumar&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.  "The malware leverages a DNS attack technique called 'DNS Hijacking' in which an attacker-controlled DNS server manipulates the response of DNS queries and resolves them as per their malicious requirements."   DNS hijacking is a&nbsp; redirection attack &nbsp;in which DNS queries to genuine websites are intercepted to take an unsuspecting user to fraudulent pages under an adversary's control. Unlike&nbsp; cache poisoning , DNS hijacking targets the DNS record of the website on the nameserver, rather than a resolver's cache.   Lyceum , also known as Hexane, Spirli

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Chinese-speaking advanced persistent threat (APT) actor dubbed&nbsp; Aoqin Dragon &nbsp;has been linked to a string of espionage-oriented attacks aimed at government, education, and telecom entities chiefly in Southeast Asia and Australia dating as far back as 2013.  "Aoqin Dragon seeks initial access primarily through document exploits and the use of fake removable devices," SentinelOne researcher Joey Chen&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Other techniques the attacker has been observed using include DLL hijacking,&nbsp; Themida-packed files , and DNS tunneling to evade post-compromise detection."  The group is said to have some level of association with another threat actor known as&nbsp; Naikon &nbsp;(aka Override Panda), with campaigns primarily directed against targets in Australia, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam.   Infections chains mounted by Aoqin Dragon have banked on Asia-Pacific political affairs and pornographic-themed docu

Researchers Warn of Spam Campaign Targeting Victims with SVCReady Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/researchers-warn-of-spam-campaign.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new wave of phishing campaigns has been observed spreading a previously documented malware called SVCReady .  "The malware is notable for the unusual way it is delivered to target PCs — using shellcode hidden in the properties of Microsoft Office documents," Patrick Schläpfer, a threat analyst at HP,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up.  SVCReady is said to be in its early stage of development, with the authors iteratively updating the malware several times last month. First signs of activity date back to April 22, 2022.  Infection chains involve sending Microsoft Word document attachments to targets via email that contain VBA macros to activate the deployment of malicious payloads.   But where this campaign stands apart is that instead of employing PowerShell or MSHTA to retrieve next-stage executables from a remote server, the macro runs shellcode stored in the&nbsp; document properties , which subsequently drops the SVCReady malware.  In addition to achieving persistence on the i

Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) last week disclosed that it had taken legal proceedings against an Iranian threat actor dubbed&nbsp; Bohrium &nbsp;in connection with a spear-phishing operation.

"Once personal information was obtained from the victims, Bohrium sent malicious emails with links that ultimately infected their target's computers with malware."  According to an&nbsp; ex parte order &nbsp;shared by the tech giant, the goal of the intrusions was to steal and exfiltrate sensitive information, take control over the infected machines, and carry out remote reconnaissance.

Atlassian on Friday rolled out fixes to address a&nbsp; critical security flaw &nbsp;affecting its Confluence Server and Data Center products that have come under active exploitation by threat actors to achieve remote code execution.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-26134 , the issue is similar to&nbsp; CVE-2021-26084 &nbsp;— another security flaw the Australian software company patched in August 2021.  Both relate to a case of Object-Graph Navigation Language ( OGNL ) injection that could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance.   The newly discovered shortcoming impacts all supported versions of Confluence Server and Data Center, with every version after 1.3.0 also affected. It's been resolved in the following versions -   7.4.17  7.13.7  7.14.3  7.15.2  7.16.4  7.17.4  7.18.1   According to stats from internet asset discovery platform&nbsp; Censys , there are about 9,325 services across 8,347 distinct hosts running a vulnerable version of Atlassian Confluenc

Chinese LuoYu Hackers Using Man-on-the-Side Attacks to Deploy WinDealer Backdoor<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/chinese-luoyu-hackers-using-man-on-side.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An "extremely sophisticated" Chinese-speaking advanced persistent threat (APT) actor dubbed&nbsp; LuoYu &nbsp;has been observed using a malicious Windows tool called WinDealer that's delivered by means of man-on-the-side attacks.  "This groundbreaking development allows the actor to modify network traffic in-transit to insert malicious payloads," Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "Such attacks are especially dangerous and devastating because they do not require any interaction with the target to lead to a successful infection."  Known to be active since 2008, organizations targeted by LuoYu are predominantly foreign diplomatic organizations established in China and members of the academic community as well as financial, defense, logistics, and telecommunications companies.   LuoYu's use of&nbsp; WinDealer &nbsp;was first documented by Taiwanese cybersecurity firm&nbsp; TeamT5 &nbsp;at the Japan Security Analyst Conference (JSAC) in January 2021. S

Microsoft on Thursday said it took steps to disable malicious activity stemming from abuse of OneDrive by a previously undocumented threat actor it tracks under the chemical element-themed moniker Polonium.  In addition to removing the offending accounts created by the Lebanon-based activity group, the tech giant's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said it suspended over 20 malicious OneDrive applications created and that it notified affected organizations.  "The observed activity was coordinated with other actors affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), based primarily on victim overlap and commonality of tools and techniques," MSTIC&nbsp; assessed &nbsp;with "moderate confidence."   The adversarial collective is believed to have breached more than 20 organizations based in Israel and one intergovernmental organization with operations in Lebanon since February 2022.  Targets of interest included entities in the manufacturing, IT, transpo

An "aggressive" advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as SideWinder  has been linked to over 1,000 new attacks since April 2020.

SideWinder , also called Rattlesnake or T-APT-04, is said to have been active since at least 2012 with a&nbsp; track record &nbsp;of targeting military, defense, aviation, IT companies, and legal firms in Central Asian countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan.

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new ransomware strain called&nbsp; GoodWill &nbsp;that compels victims into donating for social causes and provide financial assistance to people in need.  "The ransomware group propagates very unusual demands in exchange for the decryption key," researchers from CloudSEK&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "The Robin Hood-like group claims to be interested in helping the less fortunate, rather than extorting victims for financial motivations."   Written in .NET, the ransomware was first identified by the India-based cybersecurity firm in March 2022, with the infections rendering sensitive files inaccessible without decrypting them. The malware, which makes use of the&nbsp; AES algorithm &nbsp;for encryption, is also notable for sleeping for 722.45 seconds to interfere with dynamic analysis.  The encryption process is followed by displaying a multiple-paged ransom note that requires the victims to carry out three socially-driven activitie

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown advanced persistent threat (APT) group has been linked to a series of spear-phishing attacks targeting Russian government entities since the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war in late February 2022.  "The campaigns [...] are designed to implant a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that can be used to surveil the computers it infects, and run commands on them remotely," Malwarebytes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published Tuesday.  The cybersecurity company attributed the attacks with low confidence to a Chinese hacking group, citing infrastructure overlaps between the RAT and Sakula Rat malware used by a threat actor known as&nbsp; Deep Panda .  The attack chains, while leveraging different lures over the course of two months, all employed the same malware barring small differences in the source code.   The campaign is said to have commenced around February 26, days after Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, with the emails distributing the RAT under the guise of an interac

Researchers Uncover Rust Supply Chain Attack Targeting Cloud CI Pipelines<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/researchers-uncover-rust-supply-chain.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A case of software supply chain attack has been observed in the Rust programming language's&nbsp; crate registry &nbsp;that leveraged typosquatting techniques to publish a rogue library containing malware.  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne dubbed the attack " CrateDepression ."  Typosquatting attacks&nbsp; take place &nbsp;when an adversary mimics the name of a popular package on a public registry in hopes that developers will accidentally download the malicious package instead of the legitimate library.   In this case, the crate in question is "rustdecimal," a typosquat of the real " rust_decimal " package that's been downloaded over 3.5 million times to date. The package was&nbsp; flagged &nbsp;earlier this month on May 3 by Askar Safin, a Moscow-based developer.  According to an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;published by the Rust maintainers, the crate is said to have been first pushed on March 25, 2022, attracting fewer than 500 downloads before it was permanently removed from the repository.

Hackers Exploiting VMware Horizon to Target South Korea with NukeSped Backdoor<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/hackers-exploiting-vmware-horizon-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korea-backed Lazarus Group has been observed leveraging the&nbsp; Log4Shell vulnerability &nbsp;in VMware Horizon servers to deploy the NukeSped  (aka Manuscrypt) implant against targets located in its southern counterpart.  "The attacker used the Log4j vulnerability on VMware Horizon products that were not applied with the security patch," AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.   The intrusions are said to have been first discovered in April, although&nbsp; multiple threat actors , including those aligned with&nbsp; China &nbsp;and&nbsp; Iran , have employed the same approach to further their objectives over the past few months.   NukeSped is a backdoor that can perform various malicious activities based on commands received from a remote attacker-controlled domain. Last year, Kaspersky disclosed a spear-phishing campaign aimed at stealing critical data from defense companies using a NukeSped variant called&nbsp; ThreatNeedle .  Some of the key functions of the bac

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Fraudulent domains masquerading as Microsoft's Windows 11 download portal are attempting to trick users into deploying trojanized installation files to infect systems with the Vidar information stealer malware.  "The spoofed sites were created to distribute malicious ISO files which lead to a Vidar info-stealer infection on the endpoint," Zscaler&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "These variants of Vidar malware fetch the C2 configuration from attacker-controlled social media channels hosted on Telegram and Mastodon network."  Some of the rogue distribution vector domains, which were registered last month on April 20, consist of ms-win11[.]com, win11-serv[.]com, and win11install[.]com, and ms-teams-app[.]net.   In addition, the cybersecurity firm cautioned that the threat actor behind the impersonation campaign is also leveraging backdoored versions of Adobe Photoshop and other legitimate software such as Microsoft Teams to deliver Vidar malware.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Tuesday warned that it recently spotted a malicious campaign targeting SQL Servers that leverages a built-in PowerShell binary to achieve persistence on compromised systems.  The intrusions, which leverage brute-force attacks as an initial compromise vector, stand out for their use of the utility " sqlps.exe ," the tech giant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets.  The ultimate goals of the campaign are unknown, as is the identity of the threat actor staging it. Microsoft is tracking the malware under the name " SuspSQLUsage ."   The sqlps.exe utility, which comes by default with all versions of SQL Servers, enables an SQL Agent — a Windows service to run scheduled tasks — to run jobs using the PowerShell subsystem.  "The attackers achieve fileless persistence by spawning the sqlps.exe utility, a PowerShell wrapper for running SQL-built cmdlets, to run recon commands and change the start mode of the SQL service to LocalSystem," Microsoft noted.

Russian Conti Ransomware Gang Threatens to Overthrow New Costa Rican Government<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/russian-conti-ransomware-gang-threatens.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious Conti ransomware gang, which last month staged an attack on Costa Rican administrative systems, has threatened to "overthrow" the new government of the country.  "We are determined to overthrow the government by means of a cyber attack, we have already shown you all the strength and power," the group said on its official website. "We have our insiders in your government. We are also working on gaining access to your other systems, you have no other options but to pay us."  In a further attempt to increase pressure, the Russian-speaking cybercrime syndicate has raised its ransom demand to $20 million in return for a decryption key to unlock their systems.  Another message posted on its dark web portal over the weekend issued a warning stating it will delete the decryption keys in a week, a move that would make it impossible for Costa Rica to recover access to the files encrypted by the ransomware.

A spear-phishing campaign targeting Jordan's foreign ministry has been observed dropping a new stealthy backdoor dubbed Saitama.  Researchers from Malwarebytes and Fortinet FortiGuard Labs&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the campaign to an Iranian cyber espionage threat actor tracked under the moniker APT34, citing&nbsp; resemblances &nbsp;to past campaigns staged by the group.  "Like many of these attacks, the email contained a malicious attachment," Fortinet researcher Fred Gutierrez&nbsp; said . "However, the attached threat was not a garden-variety malware. Instead, it had the capabilities and techniques usually associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs)."   APT34, also known as OilRig, Helix Kitten, and Cobalt Gypsy, is known to be active since at least 2014 and has a track record of striking telecom, government, defense, oil, and financial sectors in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) via targeted phishing attacks.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has warned of phishing attacks that deploy an information-stealing malware called Jester Stealer  on compromised systems.  The mass email campaign carries the subject line "chemical attack" and contains a link to a macro-enabled Microsoft Excel file, opening which leads to computers getting infected with Jester Stealer.  The attack, which requires potential victims to enable macros after opening the document, works by downloading and executing an .EXE file that is retrieved from compromised web resources, CERT-UA detailed.   Jester Stealer, which was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Cyble in February 2022, comes with features to steal and transmit login credentials, cookies, and credit card information along with data from passwords managers, chat messengers, email clients, crypto wallets, and gaming apps to the attackers.

The China-based threat actor known as Mustang Panda  has been observed refining and retooling its tactics and malware to strike entities located in Asia, the European Union, Russia, and the U.S.  "Mustang Panda is a highly motivated APT group relying primarily on the use of topical lures and social engineering to trick victims into infecting themselves," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report detailing the group's evolving modus operandi.   The group is known to have targeted a wide range of organizations since at least 2012, with the actor primarily relying on email-based social engineering to gain initial access to drop PlugX, a backdoor predominantly deployed for long-term access.  Phishing messages attributed to the campaign contain malicious lures masquerading as official European Union reports on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine or Ukrainian government reports, both of which download malware onto compromised machines.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud-based code hosting platform GitHub described the recent&nbsp; attack campaign &nbsp;involving the abuse of OAuth access tokens issued to Heroku and Travis-CI as "highly targeted" in nature.  "This pattern of behavior suggests the attacker was only listing organizations in order to identify accounts to selectively target for listing and downloading private repositories," GitHub's Mike Hanley&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an updated post.   The&nbsp; security incident , which it discovered on April 12, related to an unidentified attacker leveraging stolen OAuth user tokens issued to two third-party OAuth integrators, Heroku and Travis-CI, to download data from dozens of organizations, including NPM.  The Microsoft-owned company said last week that it's in the process of sending a final set of notifications to GitHub customers who had either the Heroku or Travis CI OAuth app integrations authorized in their accounts.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Russian state-sponsored threat actor has been observed targeting diplomatic and government entities as part of a series of phishing campaigns commencing on January 17, 2022.  Threat intelligence and incident response firm Mandiant attributed the attacks to a hacking group tracked as APT29 (aka Cozy Bear), with some set of the activities associated with the crew assigned the moniker&nbsp; Nobelium &nbsp;(aka UNC2452/2652).  "This latest wave of spear phishing showcases APT29's enduring interests in obtaining diplomatic and foreign policy information from governments around the world," Mandiant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.  The initial access is said to have been aided through spear-phishing emails masquerading as administrative notices, using legitimate but compromised email addresses from other diplomatic entities.

Cloudflare Thwarts Record DDoS Attack Peaking at 15 Million Requests Per Second<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/cloudflare-thwarts-record-ddos-attack.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloudflare on Wednesday disclosed that it acted to mitigate a 15.3 million request-per-second (RPS) distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. The web infrastructure and website security company called it one of the "largest HTTPS DDoS attacks on record."&nbsp;  "HTTPS DDoS attacks are more expensive in terms of required computational resources because of the higher cost of establishing a secure TLS encrypted connection," Cloudflare's Omer Yoachimik and Julien Desgats&nbsp; said . "Therefore it costs the attacker more to launch the attack, and for the victim to mitigate it."   The volumetric DDoS attack is said to have lasted less than 15 seconds and targeted an unnamed Cloudflare customer operating a crypto launchpad.&nbsp;  Volumetric DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm a target network/service with significantly high volumes of malicious traffic, which typically originate from a botnet under a threat actor's control.   Cloudflare said the latest attack w

Chinese Hackers Targeting Russian Military Personnel with Updated PlugX Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/chinese-hackers-targeting-russian.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A China-linked government-sponsored threat actor observed striking European diplomatic entities in March may have been targeting Russian government officials with an updated version of a remote access trojan called&nbsp; PlugX .  Secureworks attributed the attempted intrusions to a threat actor it tracks as Bronze President, and by the wider cybersecurity community under the monikers Mustang Panda, TA416, HoneyMyte, RedDelta, and PKPLUG.  "The war in Ukraine has prompted many countries to deploy their cyber capabilities to gain insight about global events, political machinations, and motivations," the cybersecurity firm&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This desire for situational awareness often extends to collecting intelligence from allies and 'friends.'"  Bronze President, active since at least July 2018, has a history of conducting espionage operations by leveraging custom and publicly available tools to compromise, maintain long-term access,

North Korean Hackers Target Journalists with GOLDBACKDOOR Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/north-korean-hackers-target-journalists.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A state-backed threat actor with ties to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DRPK) has been attributed to a spear-phishing campaign targeting journalists covering the country with the ultimate goal of deploying a backdoor on infected Windows systems.  The intrusions, said to be the work of Ricochet Chollima, resulted in the deployment of a novel malware strain called GOLDBACKDOOR, an artifact that shares technical overlaps with another malware named BLUELIGHT, which has been previously linked to the group.  "Journalists are high-value targets for hostile governments," cybersecurity firm Stairwell&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "Compromising a journalist can provide access to highly-sensitive information and enable additional attacks against their sources."   Ricochet Chollima, also known as&nbsp; APT37 , InkySquid, and ScarCruft, is a North Korean-nexus targeted intrusion adversary that has been involved in espionage attacks since at least 2016. The

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Iranian-linked threat actor known as&nbsp; Rocket Kitten &nbsp;has been observed actively exploiting a recently patched VMware vulnerability to gain initial access and deploy the Core Impact penetration testing tool on vulnerable systems.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-22954 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), the critical issue concerns a case of remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager.   While the issue was patched by the virtualization services provider on April 6, 2022, the company&nbsp; cautioned users &nbsp;of confirmed exploitation of the flaw occurring in the wild a week later.  "A malicious actor exploiting this RCE vulnerability potentially gains an unlimited attack surface," researchers from Morphisec Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "This means highest privileged access into any components of the virtualized host and guest environment."   Attack chains exploiting the flaw involve the distribution of a PowerShell-based stager, which is the

A previously unknown zero-click exploit in Apple's iMessage was used to install mercenary spyware from&nbsp; NSO Group &nbsp;and&nbsp; Candiru &nbsp;against at least 65 individuals as part of a "multi-year clandestine operation."  "Victims included Members of the European Parliament, Catalan Presidents, legislators, jurists, and members of civil society organizations," the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "Family members were also infected in some cases."  Of the 65 individuals, 63 were targeted with Pegasus and four others were infected with Candiru, with iPhones belonging to at least two compromised with both. The incidents are said to have mostly occurred between 2017 and 2020.   The attacks involved the weaponization of an iOS exploit dubbed HOMAGE that made it possible to penetrate the devices running versions prior to iOS 13.2, which was released on October 28, 2019. It's worth noting that the latest version of iOS is iOS 15.4.1.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has warned of a new wave of social engineering campaigns delivering IcedID malware and leveraging Zimbra exploits with the goal of stealing sensitive information.  Attributing the IcedID phishing attacks to a threat cluster named UAC-0041, the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;the infection sequence begins with an email containing a Microsoft Excel document (Мобілізаційний реєстр.xls or Mobilization Register.xls) that, when opened, prompts the users to enable macros, leading to the deployment of IcedID.   The&nbsp; information-stealing malware , also known as BokBot, has followed a similar trajectory to that of TrickBot, Emotet, and ZLoader, evolving from its earlier roots as a banking trojan to a full-fledged crimeware service that facilities the retrieval of next-stage implants such as ransomware.   The&nbsp; second set of targeted intrusions &nbsp;relate to a new threat group dubbed UAC-0097, with the email including a number of image attachments with a&nbsp; Cont

"The attackers attempted to take down several infrastructure components of their target, namely: Electrical substations, Windows-operated computing systems, Linux-operated server equipment, [and] active network equipment," The State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement.  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, which collaborated with CERT-UA to analyze the attack, said the attempted intrusion involved the use of ICS-capable malware and regular disk wipers, with the adversary unleashing an updated variant of the&nbsp; Industroyer &nbsp;malware, which was first deployed in a 2016 assault on Ukraine's power grid.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor with affiliations to the cyber warfare division of Hamas has been linked to an "elaborate campaign" targeting high-profile Israeli individuals employed in sensitive defense, law enforcement, and emergency services organizations.  "The campaign operators use sophisticated social engineering techniques, ultimately aimed to deliver previously undocumented backdoors for Windows and Android devices," cybersecurity company Cybereason&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report.  "The goal behind the attack was to extract sensitive information from the victims' devices for espionage purposes."  The monthslong intrusions, codenamed " Operation Bearded Barbie ," have been attributed to an Arabic-speaking and politically-motivated group called Arid Viper, which operates out of the Middle East and is also known by the monikers APT-C-23 and Desert Falcon.

A Chinese state-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) group known for singling out Japanese entities has been attributed to a new long-running espionage campaign targeting new geographies, suggesting a "widening" of the threat actor's targeting.  The widespread intrusions, which are believed to have commenced at the earliest in mid-2021 and continued as recently as February 2022, have been tied to a group tracked as Cicada , which is also known as APT10, Stone Panda, Potassium, Bronze Riverside, or MenuPass Team.  "Victims in this Cicada (aka APT10) campaign include government, legal, religious, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in multiple countries around the world, including in Europe, Asia, and North America," researchers from the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom Software,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The cyberattack aimed at Viasat that temporarily knocked KA-SAT modems offline on February 24, 2022, the same day Russian military forces invaded Ukraine, is believed to have been the consequence of wiper malware, according to the&nbsp; latest research &nbsp;from SentinelOne.  The findings come as the U.S. telecom company&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;that it was the target of a multifaceted and deliberate" cyberattack against its KA-SAT network, linking it to a "ground-based network intrusion by an attacker exploiting a misconfiguration in a VPN appliance to gain remote access to the trusted management segment of the KA-SAT network."  Upon gaining access, the adversary issued "destructive commands" on tens of thousands of modems belonging to the satellite broadband service that "overwrote key data in flash memory on the modems, rendering the modems unable to access the network, but not permanently unusable."

A Chinese advanced persistent threat tracked as Deep Panda has been observed exploiting the&nbsp; Log4Shell vulnerability &nbsp;in VMware Horizon servers to deploy a backdoor and a novel rootkit on infected machines with the goal of stealing sensitive data.  "The nature of targeting was opportunistic insofar that multiple infections in several countries and various sectors occurred on the same dates,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Rotem Sde-Or and Eliran Voronovitch, researchers with Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs, in a report released this week. "The victims belong to the financial, academic, cosmetics, and travel industries."  Deep Panda , also known by the monikers Shell Crew, KungFu Kittens, and Bronze Firestone, is said to have been active since at least 2010, with recent attacks "targeting legal firms for data exfiltration and technology providers for command-and-control infrastructure building,"&nbsp; according &nbsp;to Secureworks.

A Belarusian threat actor known as Ghostwriter (aka UNC1151) has been spotted leveraging the recently disclosed browser-in-the-browser (BitB) technique as part of their credential phishing campaigns exploiting the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict.  The method, which&nbsp; masquerades &nbsp;as a legitimate domain by simulating a browser window within the browser, makes it possible to mount convincing social engineering campaigns.  "Ghostwriter actors have quickly adopted this new technique, combining it with a previously observed technique, hosting credential phishing landing pages on compromised sites," Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report, using it to siphon credentials entered by unsuspected victims to a remote server.  Among other groups&nbsp; using the war as a lure &nbsp;in phishing and malware campaigns to deceive targets into opening fraudulent emails or links include&nbsp; Mustang Panda &nbsp;and&nbsp; Scarab &nbsp;as well as nation-state actors from Iran, North Korea, and Russia

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A nascent information stealer called Mars has been observed in campaigns that take advantage of cracked versions of the malware to steal information stored in web browsers and cryptocurrency wallets.  "Mars Stealer is being distributed via social engineering techniques, malspam campaigns, malicious software cracks, and keygens," Morphisec malware researcher Arnold Osipov&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday.  Based on the&nbsp; Oski Stealer &nbsp;and first discovered in June 2021,&nbsp; Mars Stealer &nbsp;is said to be constantly under development and available for sale on over 47 underground forums, darknet sites, and Telegram channels, costing only $160 for a lifetime subscription.   Information stealers allow adversaries to vacuum personal information from compromised systems, including stored credentials and browser cookies, which are then sold on criminal marketplaces or used as a springboard for launching further attacks.

A threat actor of likely Pakistani origin has been attributed to yet another campaign designed to backdoor targets of interest with a Windows-based remote access trojan named CrimsonRAT since at least June 2021.  "Transparent Tribe has been a highly active APT group in the Indian subcontinent," Cisco Talos researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis shared with The Hacker News. "Their primary targets have been government and military personnel in Afghanistan and India. This campaign furthers this targeting and their central goal of establishing long term access for espionage."   Last month, the advanced persistent threat expanded its malware toolset to compromise Android devices with a backdoor named&nbsp; CapraRAT &nbsp;that exhibits a high "degree of crossover" with CrimsonRAT.  The latest set of attacks detailed by Cisco Talos involves making use of fake domains that mimic legitimate government and related organizations to deliver the malicious payloads, including a Pytho

A threat actor dubbed " RED-LILI " has been linked to an ongoing large-scale supply chain attack campaign targeting the NPM package repository by publishing nearly 800 malicious modules.  "Customarily, attackers use an anonymous disposable NPM account from which they launch their attacks," Israeli security company Checkmarx&nbsp; said . "As it seems this time, the attacker has fully-automated the process of NPM account creation and has opened dedicated accounts, one per package, making his new malicious packages batch harder to spot."  The findings build on recent reports from&nbsp; JFrog &nbsp;and&nbsp; Sonatype , both of which detailed hundreds of NPM packages that leverage techniques like&nbsp; dependency confusion &nbsp;and typosquatting to target Azure, Uber, and Airbnb developers.   According to a detailed analysis of RED-LILI's modus operandi, earliest evidence of anomalous activity is said to have occurred on February 23, 2022, with the cluster of malicious packages publis

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An independent security researcher has shared what's a detailed timeline of events that transpired as the notorious LAPSUS$ extortion gang broke into a third-party provider linked to the cyber incident at Okta in late January 2022.  In a set of screenshots posted on Twitter, Bill Demirkapi&nbsp; published &nbsp;a two-page "intrusion timeline" allegedly prepared by Mandiant, the cybersecurity firm hired by Sitel to investigate the security breach. Sitel, through its acquisition of Sykes Enterprises in September 2021, is the third-party service provider that provides customer support on behalf of Okta.  The authentication services provider revealed last week that on January 20, it was alerted to a new factor that was added to a Sitel customer support engineer's Okta account, an attempt that it said was successful and blocked.   The incident only came to light two months later after LAPSUS$&nbsp; posted screenshots &nbsp;on their Telegram channel as evidence of the breach on March 22.  The

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators of the&nbsp; Purple Fox malware &nbsp;have retooled their malware arsenal with a new variant of a remote access trojan called FatalRAT, while also simultaneously upgrading their evasion mechanisms to bypass security software.  "Users' machines are targeted via trojanized software packages masquerading as legitimate application installers," Trend Micro researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published on March 25, 2022. "The installers are actively distributed online to trick users and increase the overall botnet infrastructure."   The findings follow&nbsp; prior research &nbsp;from Minerva Labs that shed light on a similar modus operandi of leveraging fraudulent Telegram applications to distribute the backdoor. Other disguised software installers include WhatsApp, Adobe Flash Player, and Google Chrome.  These packages act as a first-stage loader, triggering an infection sequence that leads to the deployment of a second-stage payload from a remote server and culminating in the

Iranian Hackers Targeting Turkey and Arabian Peninsula in New Malware Campaign<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/iranian-hackers-targeting-turkey-and.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian state-sponsored threat actor known as MuddyWater has been attributed to a new swarm of attacks targeting Turkey and the Arabian Peninsula with the goal of deploying remote access trojans (RATs) on compromised systems.  "The MuddyWater supergroup is highly motivated and can use unauthorized access to conduct espionage, intellectual property theft, and deploy ransomware and destructive malware in an enterprise," Cisco Talos researchers Asheer Malhotra, Vitor Ventura, and Arnaud Zobec&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today.  The group, which has been active since at least 2017, is known for its attacks on various sectors that help further advance Iran's geopolitical and national security objectives. In January 2022, the U.S. Cyber Command attributed the actor to the country's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).   MuddyWater is also believed to be a "conglomerate of&nbsp; multiple teams &nbsp;operating independently rather than a single threat actor group,&amp;q

Second New 'IsaacWiper' Data Wiper Targets Ukraine After Russian Invasion<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/second-new-isaacwiper-data-wiper.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new data wiper malware has been observed deployed against an unnamed Ukrainian government network, a day after destructive cyber attacks struck multiple entities in the country preceding the start of Russia's military invasion.  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET dubbed the new malware " IsaacWiper ," which it said was detected on February 24 in an organization that was not affected by&nbsp; HermeticWiper &nbsp;(aka FoxBlade), another data wiping malware that targeted several organizations on February 23 as part of a sabotage operation aimed at rendering the machines inoperable.  Further analysis of the HermeticWiper attacks, which infected at least five Ukrainian organizations, have revealed a worm constituent that propagates the malware across the compromised network and a ransomware module that acts as a "distraction from the wiper attacks," corroborating a&nbsp; prior report &nbsp;from Symantec.

Update:  It's worth noting that the malware Microsoft tracks as FoxBlade is the same  as the data wiper that's been denominated HermeticWiper  (aka KillDisk).  Microsoft on Monday disclosed that it detected a new round of offensive and destructive cyberattacks directed against Ukraine's digital infrastructure hours before Russia launched its first missile strikes last week.  The intrusions involved the use of a never-before-seen malware package dubbed FoxBlade , according to the tech giant's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), noting that it added new signatures to its Defender anti-malware service to detect the exploit within three hours of the discovery.   "These recent and ongoing cyberattacks have been precisely targeted, and we have not seen the use of the indiscriminate malware technology that spread across Ukraine's economy and beyond its borders in the&nbsp; 2017 NotPetya attack ," Microsoft's President and Vice Chair, Brad Smith,&nbsp; said .

A previously undocumented espionage tool has been deployed against selected governments and other critical infrastructure targets as part of a long-running espionage campaign orchestrated by China-linked threat actors since at least 2013.  Broadcom's Symantec Threat Hunter team characterized the backdoor, named&nbsp; Daxin , as a technologically advanced malware, allowing the attackers to carry out a variety of communications and information-gathering operations aimed at entities in the telecom, transportation, and manufacturing sectors that are of strategic interest to China.  "Daxin malware is a highly sophisticated rootkit backdoor with complex, stealthy command-and-control (C2) functionality that enables remote actors to communicate with secured devices not connected directly to the internet," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an independent advisory.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An advanced persistent threat (APT) group operating with objectives aligned with the Chinese government has been linked to an organized supply chain attack on Taiwan's financial sector.  The attacks are said to have first commenced at the end of November 2021, with the intrusions attributed to a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; APT10 , also known as Stone Panda, the MenuPass group, and Bronze Riverside, and known to be active since at least 2009.   The second wave of attacks hit a peak between February 10 and 13, 2022, according to a&nbsp; new report &nbsp;published by Taiwanese cybersecurity firm CyCraft, which said the wide-ranging supply chain compromise specifically targeted the software systems of financial institutions, resulting in "abnormal cases of placing orders."  The infiltration activity, codenamed " Operation Cache Panda ," exploited a vulnerability in the web management interface of the unnamed securities software that has a market share of over 80% in Taiwan, usi

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Vulnerable internet-facing Microsoft SQL (MS SQL) Servers are being targeted by threat actors as part of a new campaign to deploy the Cobalt Strike adversary simulation tool on compromised hosts.  "Attacks that target MS SQL servers include attacks to the environment where its vulnerability has not been patched, brute forcing, and&nbsp; dictionary attack &nbsp;against poorly managed servers," South Korean cybersecurity company AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Monday.   Cobalt Strike is a commercial, full-featured&nbsp; penetration testing framework &nbsp;that allows an attacker to deploy an agent named "Beacon" on the victim machine, granting the operator remote access to the system. Although billed as a red team threat simulation platform,&nbsp; cracked versions &nbsp;of the software have been&nbsp; actively used &nbsp;by a wide range of threat actors.  Intrusions observed by ASEC involve the unidentified actor scanning port 1433 to check for exposed MS SQL s

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An investigation into the cyberattack targeting Iranian national media corporation, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), in late January 2022 resulted in the deployment of a wiper malware and other custom implants, as the country's national infrastructure continues to face a&nbsp; wave &nbsp;of&nbsp; attacks &nbsp;aimed at inflicting serious damage.  "This indicates that the attackers' aim was also to disrupt the state's broadcasting networks, with the damage to the TV and radio networks possibly more serious than officially reported," Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.  The 10-second attack, which took place on January 27, involved the breach of state broadcaster IRIB to air pictures of Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization ( MKO ) leaders Maryam and Massoud Rajavi alongside a call for the assassination of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Iranian Hackers Targeting VMware Horizon Log4j Flaws to Deploy Ransomware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/iranian-hackers-targeting-vmware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A "potentially destructive actor" aligned with the government of Iran is actively exploiting the well-known&nbsp; Log4j vulnerability &nbsp;to infect unpatched VMware Horizon servers with ransomware.  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne dubbed the group " TunnelVision " owing to their heavy reliance on tunneling tools, with overlaps in tactics observed to that of a broader group tracked under the moniker&nbsp; Phosphorus &nbsp;as well as Charming Kitten and Nemesis Kitten.   "TunnelVision activities are characterized by wide-exploitation of 1-day vulnerabilities in target regions," SentinelOne researchers Amitai Ben Shushan Ehrlich and Yair Rigevsky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report, with the intrusions detected in the Middle East and the U.S.  Also observed alongside Log4Shell is the exploitation of Fortinet FortiOS path traversal flaw ( CVE-2018-13379 ) and the Microsoft Exchange&nbsp; ProxyShell &nbsp;vulnerability to gain initial access into the target networks for post-exploitation.

Moses Staff Hackers Targeting Israeli Organizations for Cyber Espionage<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/moses-staff-hackers-targeting-israeli.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The politically motivated Moses Staff  hacker group has been observed using a custom multi-component toolset with the goal of carrying out espionage against its targets as part of a new campaign that exclusively singles out Israeli organizations.  First&nbsp; publicly documented &nbsp;in late 2021, Moses Staff is believed to be sponsored by the Iranian government, with attacks reported against entities in Israel, Italy, India, Germany, Chile, Turkey, the U.A.E., and the U.S.  Earlier this month, the hacker collective was observed incorporating a previously undocumented remote access trojan (RAT) called " StrifeWater " that masquerades as the Windows Calculator app to evade detection.   "Close examination reveals that the group has been active for over a year, much earlier than the group's first official public exposure, managing to stay under the radar with an extremely low detection rate," findings from FortiGuard Labs&nbsp; reveal .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the inner workings of ShadowPad , a sophisticated and modular backdoor that has been adopted by a growing number of Chinese threat groups in recent years, while also linking it to the country's civilian and military intelligence agencies.  "ShadowPad is decrypted in memory using a custom decryption algorithm," researchers from Secureworks said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "ShadowPad extracts information about the host, executes commands, interacts with the file system and registry, and deploys new modules to extend functionality."  ShadowPad &nbsp;is a modular malware platform sharing noticeable overlaps to the&nbsp; PlugX &nbsp;malware and which has been put to use in high-profile attacks against NetSarang, CCleaner, and ASUS, causing the operators to shift tactics and update their defensive measures.   While initial campaigns that delivered ShadowPad were attributed to a threat cluster tracked as&nbsp; Bronze Atlas &nbsp;aka Barium

A previously unknown hacking group has been linked to targeted attacks against human rights activists, human rights defenders, academics, and lawyers across India in an attempt to plant "incriminating digital evidence."  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne attributed the intrusions to a group it tracks as " ModifiedElephant ," an elusive threat actor that's been operational since at least 2012, whose activity aligns sharply with Indian state interests.  "ModifiedElephant operates through the use of commercially available remote access trojans (RATs) and has potential ties to the commercial surveillance industry," the researchers&nbsp; said . "The threat actor uses spear-phishing with malicious documents to deliver malware, such as&nbsp; NetWire ,&nbsp; DarkComet , and simple keyloggers."   The primary goal of ModifiedElephant is to facilitate long-term surveillance of targeted individuals, ultimately leading to the delivery of "evidence" on the victim

Iranian Hackers Using New Marlin Backdoor in 'Out to Sea' Espionage Campaign<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/iranian-hackers-using-new-marlin.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An advanced persistent threat (APT) group with ties to Iran has refreshed its malware toolset to include a new backdoor dubbed&nbsp; Marlin &nbsp;as part of a long-running espionage campaign that started in April 2018.  Slovak cybersecurity company ESET attributed the attacks — codenamed "Out to Sea" &nbsp;— to a threat actor called&nbsp; OilRig &nbsp;(aka APT34), while also conclusively connecting its activities to a second Iranian group tracked under the name&nbsp; Lyceum &nbsp;(Hexane aka&nbsp; SiameseKitten ).   "Victims of the campaign include diplomatic organizations, technology companies, and medical organizations in Israel, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates," ESET noted in its&nbsp; T3 2021 Threat Report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News.  Active since at least 2014, the hacking group is known to strike Middle Eastern governments and a variety of business verticals, including chemical, energy, financial, and telecommunications. In April 2021, the actor targeted a Lebanese entity with an implant called

Palestinian Hackers Use New NimbleMamba Implant in Recent Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/palestinian-hackers-using-new.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An advanced persistent threat (APT) hacking group operating with motives that likely align with Palestine has embarked on a new campaign that leverages a previously undocumented implant called NimbleMamba .  The intrusions leveraged a sophisticated attack chain targeting Middle Eastern governments, foreign policy think tanks, and a state-affiliated airline, enterprise security firm Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report, attributing the covert operation to a threat actor tracked as Molerats (aka TA402).  Notorious for continuously updating their malware implants and their delivery methods, the APT group was most recently linked to an&nbsp; espionage offensive &nbsp;aimed at human rights activists and journalists in Palestine and Turkey, while a previous attack exposed in June 2021 resulted in the deployment of a backdoor called&nbsp; LastConn .   But the lull in the activities has been offset by the operators actively working to retool their arsenal, resulting in the development of NimbleMamba, which is desi

In&nbsp; SEO poisoning &nbsp;attacks, adversaries artificially increase the search engine ranking of websites (genuine or otherwise) hosting their malware to make them show up on top of search results so that users searching for specific apps like TeamViewer, Visual Studio, and Zoom are infected with malware.   The installer, while packing the legitimate software, is also bundled with the BATLOADER payload that's executed during the installation process. The malware then acts as a

Cybersecurity researchers have turned the spotlight on a new wave of offensive cyberattacks targeting Palestinian activists and entities starting around October 2021 using politically-themed phishing emails and decoy documents.

The threat actor's&nbsp; activities , also tracked under the monikers Desert Falcon and the APT-C-23, were first documented in&nbsp; February 2015 &nbsp;by Kasperksy and subsequently in 2017, when Qihoo 360 disclosed details of&nbsp; cross-platform &nbsp; backdoors &nbsp;developed by the group to strike Palestinian institutions.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has disclosed details of a large-scale, multi-phase phishing campaign that uses stolen credentials to register devices on a victim's network to further propagate spam emails and widen the infection pool.  The tech giant said the attacks manifested through accounts that were not secured using multi-factor authentication (MFA), thereby making it possible for the adversary to take advantage of the target's bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy and introduce their own rogue devices using the pilfered credentials.  The attacks took place in two stages. "The first campaign phase involved stealing credentials in target organizations located predominantly in Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand," Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published this week.   "Stolen credentials were then leveraged in the second phase, in which attackers used compromised accounts to expand their foothold within the organization via la

Initial Access Broker Involved in Log4Shell Attacks Against VMware Horizon Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/initial-access-broker-involved-in.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An initial access broker group tracked as Prophet Spider  has been linked to a set of malicious activities that exploits the Log4Shell vulnerability in unpatched VMware Horizon Servers.  According to new research  published by BlackBerry Research &amp; Intelligence and Incident Response (IR) teams today, the cybercrime actor has been opportunistically weaponizing the shortcoming to download a second-stage payload onto the victimized systems.  The payloads observed include cryptocurrency miners, Cobalt Strike Beacons, and web shells, corroborating a previous advisory from the U.K. National Health Service (NHS) that&nbsp; sounded the alarm &nbsp;on active exploitation of the vulnerabilities in VMware Horizon servers to drop malicious web shells and establish persistence on affected networks for follow-on attacks.   Log4Shell &nbsp;is a moniker used to refer to an exploit affecting the popular Apache Log4j library that results in remote code execution by logging a specially crafted string. Since public

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented cyber-espionage malware aimed at Apple's macOS operating system leveraged a Safari web browser exploit as part of a watering hole attack targeting politically active, pro-democracy individuals in Hong Kong.  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the intrusion to an actor with "strong technical capabilities," calling out the campaign's overlaps to that of a similar digital offensive&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) in November 2021.  The attack chain involved compromising a legitimate website belonging to D100 Radio, a pro-democracy internet radio station in Hong Kong, to inject malicious inline frames (aka&nbsp; iframes ) between September 30 and November 4, 2021.   In the next phase, the tampered code acted as a conduit to load a&nbsp; Mach-O &nbsp;file by leveraging a remote code execution bug in WebKit that was fixed by Apple in February 2021 ( CVE-2021-1789 ). "The exploit used to gain code execution in the browser is quite

Latest analysis into the wiper malware that targeted dozens of Ukrainian agencies earlier this month has revealed "strategic similarities" to&nbsp; NotPetya malware &nbsp;that was unleashed against the country's infrastructure and elsewhere in 2017.  The malware, dubbed&nbsp; WhisperGate , was discovered by Microsoft last week, which said it observed the destructive cyber campaign targeting government, non-profit, and information technology entities in the nation, attributing the intrusions to an emerging threat cluster codenamed "DEV-0586."   "While WhisperGate has some strategic similarities to the notorious NotPetya wiper that attacked Ukranian entities in 2017, including masquerading as ransomware and targeting and destroying the master boot record (MBR) instead of encrypting it, it notably has more components designed to inflict additional damage," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report detailing its response efforts.

A North Korean cyberespionage group named Konni has been linked to a series of targeted attacks aimed at the Russian Federation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MID) with New Year lures to compromise Windows systems with malware.  "This activity cluster demonstrates the patient and persistent nature of advanced actors in waging multi-phased campaigns against perceived high-value networks," researchers from Lumen Technologies' Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis shared with The Hacker News.  The Konni group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are known to overlap with threat actors belonging to the broader&nbsp; Kimsuky &nbsp;umbrella, which is also tracked by the cybersecurity community under the monikers Velvet Chollima, ITG16, Black Banshee, and Thallium.

Microsoft is warning of continuing attempts by nation-state adversaries and commodity attackers to take advantage of&nbsp; security vulnerabilities &nbsp;uncovered in the Log4j open-source logging framework to deploy malware on vulnerable systems.  "Exploitation attempts and testing have remained high during the last weeks of December," Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in revised guidance published earlier this week. "We have observed many existing attackers adding exploits of these vulnerabilities in their existing malware kits and tactics, from coin miners to hands-on-keyboard attacks."  Publicly disclosed by the Apache Software Foundation on December 10, 2021, the remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache Log4j 2, aka&nbsp; Log4Shell , has emerged as a new attack vector for&nbsp; widespread exploitation &nbsp;by a variety of threat actors.   In the subsequent weeks, four more weaknesses in the utility have come to light —&nbsp; CVE-2021-45046 ,&nbsp; CVE-2021-45105 ,

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have demonstrated yet another variant of the SAD DNS cache poisoning attack that leaves about 38% of the domain name resolvers vulnerable, enabling attackers to redirect traffic originally destined to legitimate websites to a server under their control.  "The&nbsp; attack &nbsp;allows an off-path attacker to inject a malicious DNS record into a DNS cache," University of California researchers Keyu Man, Xin'an Zhou, and Zhiyun Qian&nbsp; said . "SAD DNS attack allows an attacker to redirect any traffic (originally destined to a specific domain) to his own server and then become a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker, allowing eavesdropping and tampering of the communication."  The latest flaw affects Linux kernels as well as popular DNS software, including BIND, Unbound, and dnsmasq running on top of Linux, but not when run on other operating systems FreeBSD or Windows.  From Kaminsky Attack to SAD DNS  DNS cache poisoning, also called DNS spoofing, is a&nbsp; technique &nbsp;i

Latest Report Uncovers Supply Chain Attacks by North Korean Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/latest-report-uncovers-supply-chain.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Lazarus Group, the advanced persistent threat (APT) group attributed to the North Korean government, has been observed waging two separate supply chain attack campaigns as a means to gain a foothold into corporate networks and target a wide range of downstream entities.  The latest intelligence-gathering operation involved the use of MATA malware framework as well as backdoors dubbed&nbsp; BLINDINGCAN &nbsp;and&nbsp; COPPERHEDGE &nbsp;to attack the defense industry, an IT asset monitoring solution vendor based in Latvia, and a think tank located in South Korea, according to a new&nbsp; Q3 2021 APT Trends report &nbsp;published by Kaspersky.   In one instance, the supply-chain attack originated from an infection chain that stemmed from legitimate South Korean security software running a malicious payload, leading to the deployment of the BLINDINGCAN and COPPERHEDGE malware on the think tank's network in June 2021. The other attack on the Latvian company in May is an "atypical victim" for Lazarus, the

NYT Journalist Repeatedly Hacked with Pegasus after Reporting on Saudi Arabia<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/nyt-journalist-repeatedly-hacked-with.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The iPhone of New York Times journalist Ben Hubbard was repeatedly hacked with NSO Group's Pegasus spyware tool over a three-year period stretching between June 2018 to June 2021, resulting in infections twice in July 2020 and June 2021.  The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which&nbsp; publicized &nbsp;the findings on Sunday, said the "targeting took place while he was reporting on Saudi Arabia, and writing a book about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman." The research institute did not attribute the infiltrations to a specific government.  In a&nbsp; statement &nbsp;shared with Hubbard, the Israeli company denied its involvement in the hacks and dismissed the findings as "speculation," while noting that the journalist was not "a target of Pegasus by any of NSO's customers."   To date, NSO Group is believed to have leveraged at least three different iOS exploits — namely an iMessage zero-click exploit in December 2019, a&nbsp; KISMET &nbsp;exploit targeting iOS 13

'Lone Wolf' Hacker Group Targeting Afghanistan and India with Commodity RATs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/lone-wolf-hacker-group-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware campaign targeting Afghanistan and India is exploiting a now-patched, 20-year-old flaw affecting Microsoft Office to deploy an array of commodity remote access trojans (RATs) that allow the adversary to gain complete control over the compromised endpoints.  Cisco Talos attributed the cyber campaign to a "lone wolf" threat actor operating a Lahore-based fake IT company called Bunse Technologies as a front to carry out the malicious activities, while also having a history of sharing content that's in favor of Pakistan and Taliban dating all the way back to 2016.   The attacks work by taking advantage of political and government-themed lure domains that host the malware payloads, with the infection chains leveraging weaponized RTF documents and PowerShell scripts that distribute malware to victims. Specifically, the laced RTF files were found exploiting&nbsp; CVE-2017-11882 &nbsp;to execute a PowerShell command that's responsible for deploying additional malware to

A spam campaign delivering spear-phishing emails aimed at South American organizations has retooled its techniques to include a wide range of commodity remote access trojans (RATs) and geolocation filtering to avoid detection, according to new research.  Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro attributed the attacks to an advanced persistent threat (APT) tracked as&nbsp; APT-C-36 &nbsp;(aka Blind Eagle), a suspected South America espionage group that has been active since at least 2018 and&nbsp; previously known &nbsp;for setting its sights on Colombian government institutions and corporations spanning financial, petroleum, and manufacturing sectors.   Primarily spread via fraudulent emails by masquerading as Colombian government agencies, such as the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs (DIAN), the infection chain commences when the message recipients open a decoy PDF or Word document that claims to be a seizure order tied to their bank accounts and click on a link that's been generated from a URL short

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A targeted phishing campaign aimed at the aviation industry for two years may be spearheaded by a threat actor operating out of Nigeria, highlighting how attackers can carry out small-scale cyber offensives for extended periods of time while staying under the radar.  Cisco Talos dubbed the malware attacks "Operation Layover," building on&nbsp; previous research &nbsp;from the Microsoft Security Intelligence team in May 2021 that delved into a "dynamic campaign targeting the aerospace and travel sectors with spear-phishing emails that distribute an actively developed loader, which then delivers RevengeRAT or AsyncRAT."   "The actor […] doesn't seem to be technically sophisticated, using off-the-shelf malware since the beginning of its activities without developing its own malware," researchers Tiago Pereira and Vitor Ventura&nbsp; said . "The actor also buys the crypters that allow the usage of such malware without being detected, throughout the years it has use

A newly discovered side-channel attack demonstrated on modern processors can be weaponized to successfully overcome&nbsp; Site Isolation protections &nbsp;weaved into Google Chrome and Chromium browsers and leak sensitive data in a&nbsp; Spectre-style &nbsp; speculative execution &nbsp;attack.  Dubbed " Spook.js " by academics from the University of Michigan, University of Adelaide, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Tel Aviv University, the technique is a&nbsp; JavaScript-based line of attack &nbsp;that specifically aims to get around barriers Google put in place after Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities came to light in January 2018, thereby potentially preventing leakage by ensuring that content from different domains is not shared in the same address space.   "An attacker-controlled webpage can know which other pages from the same websites a user is currently browsing, retrieve sensitive information from these pages, and even recover login credentials (e.g., username and password) when they are au

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday released new findings that reveal a year-long mobile espionage campaign against the Kurdish ethnic group to deploy two Android backdoors that masquerade as legitimate apps.  Active since at least March 2020, the attacks leveraged as many as six dedicated Facebook profiles that claimed to offer tech and pro-Kurd content — two aimed at Android users while the other four appeared to provide news for the Kurdish supporters — only to share links to spying apps on public Facebook groups. All the six profiles have since been taken down.  "It targeted the Kurdish ethnic group through at least 28 malicious Facebook posts that would lead potential victims to download Android 888 RAT or SpyNote," ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko&nbsp; said . "Most of the malicious Facebook posts led to downloads of the commercial, multi-platform 888 RAT, which has been available on the black market since 2018."

Microsoft's Active Directory is&nbsp; said to be used by 95% &nbsp;of Fortune 500. As a result, it is a prime target for attackers as they look to gain access to credentials in the organization, as compromised credentials provide one of the easiest ways for hackers to access your data.  A key authentication technology that underpins Microsoft Active Directory is Kerberos. Unfortunately, hackers use many different attacks against Active Directory's implementation of the Kerberos authentication protocol. One of those is AS-REP Roasting. So what is AS-REP Roasting, and how can businesses protect themselves?  What is Active Directory Kerberos?  Kerberos was originally developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and centered around using tickets to establish trust. Microsoft's implementation of Kerberos found in Active Directory is based on Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5) as defined in&nbsp; RFC 4120 . However, Microsoft has added to and enhanced Kerberos with it

Microsoft Warns of Widespread Phishing Attacks Using Open Redirects<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/microsoft-warns-of-widespread-phishing.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning of a widespread credential phishing campaign that leverages&nbsp; open redirector links &nbsp;in email communications as a vector to trick users into visiting malicious websites while effectively bypassing security software.  "Attackers combine these links with social engineering baits that impersonate well-known productivity tools and services to lure users into clicking," Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week.   "Doing so leads to a series of redirections — including a CAPTCHA verification page that adds a sense of legitimacy and attempts to evade some automated analysis systems — before taking the user to a fake sign-in page. This ultimately leads to credential compromise, which opens the user and their organization to other attacks."  Although redirect links in email messages serve a vital tool to take recipients to third-party websites or track click rates and measure the success of sales and marketin

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is warning of active exploitation attempts that leverage the latest line of " ProxyShell " Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities that were patched earlier this May, including deploying LockFile ransomware on compromised systems.  Tracked as CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207, the vulnerabilities enable adversaries to bypass ACL controls, elevate privileges on the Exchange PowerShell backend, effectively permitting the attacker to perform unauthenticated, remote code execution. While the former two were addressed by Microsoft on April 13, a patch for CVE-2021-31207 was shipped as part of the Windows maker's May Patch Tuesday updates.   "An attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable machine," CISA&nbsp; said .  The development comes a little over a week after cybersecurity researchers sounded the alarm on&nbsp; opportunistic scanning and exploitation &nbsp;of unpat

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A novel technique leverages optical emanations from a device's power indicator LED to recover sounds from connected peripherals and spy on electronic conversations from a distance of as much as 35 meters.  Dubbed the " Glowworm attack ," the findings were published by a group of academics from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev earlier this week, describing the method as "an optical&nbsp; TEMPEST &nbsp;attack that can be used by eavesdroppers to recover sound by analysing optical measurements obtained via an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of various devices."  Accompanying the experimental setup is an optical-audio transformation (OAT) that allows for retrieving sound by isolating the speech from the optical measurements obtained by directing an electro-optical sensor at the device's power indicator LED.   TEMPEST is the codename for unintentional intelligence-bearing emanations produced by electronic and electromechanical information-

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. is presently combating two pandemics--coronavirus and ransomware attacks. Both have partially shut down parts of the economy. However, in the case of cybersecurity, lax security measures allow hackers to have an easy way to rake in millions.  It's pretty simple for hackers to gain financially, using malicious software to access and encrypt data and hold it hostage until the victim pays the ransom.  Cyber attacks are more frequent now because it is effortless for hackers to execute them. Further, the payment methods are now friendlier to them. In addition, businesses are&nbsp; willing to pay a ransom &nbsp;because of the growing reliance on digital infrastructure, giving hackers more incentives to attempt more breaches.&nbsp;  Bolder cybercriminals  A few years back, cybercriminals played psychological games before getting bank passwords and using their technical know-how to steal money from people's accounts. They are bolder now because it is easy for them to buy ransomware software

IT Giant Accenture Hit by LockBit Ransomware; Hackers Threaten to Leak Data<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/it-giant-accenture-hit-by-lockbit.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Global IT consultancy giant Accenture has become the latest company to be hit by the LockBit ransomware gang, according to a post made by the operators on their dark web portal, likely filling a void left in the wake of DarkSide and REvil shutdown.  "These people are beyond privacy and security. I really hope that their services are better than what I saw as an insider," read a message posted on the data leak website. Accenture&nbsp; said &nbsp;it has since restored the affected systems from backups.   LockBit, like its now-defunct DarkSide and REvil counterparts, operates using a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, roping in other cybercriminals (aka affiliates) to carry out the intrusion using its platform, with the payments often divided between the criminal entity directing the attack and the core developers of the malware.   The ransomware group emerged on the threat landscape in September 2019, and in June 2021 launched LockBit 2.0 along with an advertising campaign to recruit

The intrusions have been attributed to an advanced persistent threat named&nbsp;APT31&nbsp;(FireEye), which is tracked by the cybersecurity community under the monikers Zirconium (Microsoft), Judgement Panda (CrowdStrike), and Bronze Vinewood (Secureworks).   The group is a "China-nexus cyber espionage actor focused on obtaining information that can provide the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises with political, economic, and military advantages,"&nbsp; according &nbsp;to FireEye.  Positive Technologies, in a&nbsp; write-up &nbsp;published Tuesday, revealed a new malware dropper that was used to facilitate the attacks, including the retrieval of next-stage encrypted payloads from a remote command-and-control server,

New PetitPotam NTLM Relay Attack Lets Hackers Take Over Windows Domains<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/new-petitpotam-ntlm-relay-attack-lets.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly uncovered security flaw in the Windows operating system can be exploited to coerce remote Windows servers, including Domain Controllers, to authenticate with a malicious destination, thereby allowing an adversary to stage an&nbsp; NTLM relay attack &nbsp;and completely take over a Windows domain.  The issue, dubbed " PetitPotam ," was discovered by security researcher Gilles Lionel, who shared technical details and proof-of-concept (PoC) code last week, noting that the flaw works by forcing "Windows hosts to authenticate to other machines via MS-EFSRPC EfsRpcOpenFileRaw function."  MS-EFSRPC &nbsp;is Microsoft's Encrypting File System Remote Protocol that's used to perform "maintenance and management operations on encrypted data that is stored remotely and accessed over a network."   Specifically, the attack enables a domain controller to authenticate against a remote NTLM under a bad actor's control using the MS-EFSRPC interface and share its authen

Chinese Hackers Exploit Latest SolarWinds 0-Day to Target U.S. Defense Firms<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/chinese-hackers-exploit-latest.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Tuesday disclosed that the latest string of attacks targeting SolarWinds Serv-U managed file transfer service with a now-patched remote code execution (RCE) exploit is the handiwork of a Chinese threat actor dubbed "DEV-0322."  The revelation comes days after the Texas-based IT monitoring software maker issued fixes for the flaw that could enable adversaries to remotely run arbitrary code with privileges, allowing them to perform actions like install and run malicious payloads or view and alter sensitive data.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-35211 , the RCE flaw resides in Serv-U's implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. While it was previously revealed that the attacks were limited in scope, SolarWinds said it's "unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers."   Attributing the intrusions with high confidence to DEV-0322 (short for "Development Group 0322") based on observed victimology, tactics, and procedures, Micr

Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday took the wraps off a new, ongoing espionage campaign targeting corporate networks in Spanish-speaking countries, specifically Venezuela, to spy on its victims.  Dubbed " Bandidos " by ESET owing to the use of an upgraded variant of Bandook malware, the primary targets of the threat actor are corporate networks in the South American country spanning across manufacturing, construction, healthcare, software services, and retail sectors.  Written in both Delphi and C++,&nbsp; Bandook &nbsp;has a history of being sold as a commercial remote access trojan (RAT) dating all the way back to 2005. Since then, numerous variants have emerged on the threat landscape and put to use in different surveillance campaigns in 2015 and 2017, allegedly by a cyber-mercenary group known as Dark Caracal on behalf of government interests in Kazakhstan and Lebanon.   In a continuing resurgence of the Bandook Trojan, Check Point last year&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;three new samples — one

U.S. technology firm Kaseya, which is firefighting the largest ever&nbsp; supply-chain ransomware strike &nbsp;on its VSA on-premises product, ruled out the possibility that its codebase was unauthorizedly tampered with to distribute malware.  While initial reports raised speculations that the ransomware gang might have gained access to Kaseya's backend infrastructure and abused it to deploy a malicious update to VSA servers running on client premises, in a modus operandi similar to that of the devastating SolarWinds hack, it has since emerged that a never-before-seen security vulnerability ( CVE-2021-30116 ) in the software was leveraged to push ransomware to Kaseya's customers.   "The attackers were able to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in the VSA product to bypass authentication and run arbitrary command execution," the Miami-headquartered company&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in the incident analysis.

Following the incident, the IT and security management services company said it took immediate steps to shut down our SaaS servers as a precautionary measure, in addition to notifying its on-premises customers to shut down their VSA servers to prevent them from being compromised.   Voccola also said the company has identified the source of the vulnerability and that it's readying a patch to mitigate the ongoing issues.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Taiwanese networking equipment company Zyxel is warning customers of an ongoing attack targeting a "small subset" of its security products such as firewall and VPN servers.  Attributing the attacks to a "sophisticated threat actor," the firm noted that the attacks single out appliances that have remote management or SSL VPN enabled, namely in the USG/ZyWALL, USG FLEX, ATP, and VPN series running on-premise ZLD firmware, implying that the targeted devices are publicly accessible over the internet.   "The threat actor attempts to access a device through WAN; if successful, they then bypass authentication and establish SSL VPN tunnels with unknown user accounts, such as 'zyxel_slIvpn', 'zyxel_ts', or 'zyxel_vpn_test', to manipulate the device's configuration," Zyxel said in an&nbsp; email message , which was shared on Twitter.   As of writing, it's not immediately known if the attacks are exploiting previously known vulnerabilities

Malware Attack on South Korean Entities Was Work of Andariel Group<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/malware-attack-on-south-korean-entities.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malware campaign targeting South Korean entities that came to light earlier this year has been attributed to a North Korean nation-state hacking group called Andariel, once again indicating that&nbsp; Lazarus &nbsp;attackers are following the trends and their&nbsp; arsenal &nbsp;is in&nbsp; constant development .  "The way Windows commands and their options were used in this campaign is almost identical to previous Andariel activity," Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep-dive published Tuesday. Victims of the attack are in the manufacturing, home network service, media, and construction sectors.   Designated as part of the Lazarus constellation, Andariel is known for unleashing attacks on South Korean organizations and businesses using specifically tailored methods created for maximum effectivity. In September 2019, the sub-group, along with Lazarus and Bluenoroff, was&nbsp; sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department &nbsp;for their malicious cyber activity on critical infrastructure.  Anda

NoxPlayer Supply-Chain Attack is Likely the Work of Gelsemium Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/noxplayer-supply-chain-attack-is-likely.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new cyber espionage group named Gelsemium has been linked to a&nbsp; supply chain attack targeting the NoxPlayer &nbsp;Android emulator that was disclosed earlier this year.  The findings come from a systematic analysis of multiple campaigns undertaken by the APT crew, with evidence of the earliest attack dating back all the way to 2014 under the codename&nbsp; Operation TooHash &nbsp;based on malware payloads deployed in those intrusions.  "Victims of these campaigns are located in East Asia as well as the Middle East and include governments, religious organizations, electronics manufacturers and universities," cybersecurity firm ESET&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week.   "Gelsemium's whole chain might appear simple at first sight, but the exhaustive configurations, implanted at each stage, modify on-the-fly settings for the final payload, making it harder to understand."  Targeted countries include China, Mongolia, North and South Korea, Japan, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Saudi

New TLS Attack Lets Attackers Launch Cross-Protocol Attacks Against Secure Sites<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/new-tls-attack-lets-attackers-launch.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed a new type of attack that exploits misconfigurations in transport layer security (TLS) servers to redirect HTTPS traffic from a victim's web browser to a different TLS service endpoint located on another IP address to steal sensitive information.  The attacks have been dubbed&nbsp; ALPACA , short for "Application Layer Protocol Confusion - Analyzing and mitigating Cracks in tls Authentication," by a group of academics from Ruhr University Bochum, Münster University of Applied Sciences, and Paderborn University.  "Attackers can redirect traffic from one subdomain to another, resulting in a valid TLS session," the study said. "This breaks the authentication of TLS and cross-protocol attacks may be possible where the behavior of one protocol service may compromise the other at the application layer."  TLS &nbsp;is a cryptographic protocol underpinning several application layer protocols like HTTPS, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP to secure com

Crypto-Mining Attacks Targeting Kubernetes Clusters via Kubeflow Instances<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/crypto-mining-attacks-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed a new large-scale campaign targeting Kubeflow deployments to run malicious cryptocurrency mining containers.  The campaign involved deploying&nbsp; TensorFlow &nbsp;pods on Kubernetes clusters, with the pods running legitimate&nbsp; TensorFlow images &nbsp;from the official Docker Hub account. However, the container images were configured to execute rogue commands that mine cryptocurrencies. Microsoft said the deployments witnessed an uptick towards the end of May.   Kubeflow &nbsp;is an open-source machine learning platform designed to deploy machine learning workflows on&nbsp; Kubernetes , an orchestration service used for managing and scaling containerized workloads across a cluster of machines.  The deployment, in itself, was achieved by taking advantage of Kubeflow, which exposes its UI functionality via a dashboard that is deployed in the cluster. In the attack observed by Microsoft, the adversaries used the centralized dashboard as an ingress point to create a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
State-sponsored hackers affiliated with North Korea have been behind a slew of attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges  over the past three years, new evidence has revealed.  Attributing the attack with "medium-high" likelihood to the Lazarus Group (aka APT38 or Hidden Cobra), researchers from Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky said the campaign, dubbed " CryptoCore ," targeted crypto exchanges in Israel, Japan, Europe, and the U.S., resulting in the theft of millions of dollars worth of virtual currencies.   The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;are a consequence of piecing together artifacts from a series of isolated but similar reports detailed by&nbsp; F-Secure , Japanese CERT&nbsp; JPCERT/CC , and&nbsp; NTT Security &nbsp;over the past few months.  Since emerging on the scene in 2009,&nbsp; Hidden Cobra &nbsp;actors have used their offensive cyber capabilities to carry out espionage and cyber cryptocurrency heists against businesses and critical infrastructure.

Insurance Firm CNA Financial Reportedly Paid Hackers $40 Million in Ransom<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/insurance-firm-cna-financial-reportedly.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. insurance giant CNA Financial reportedly paid $40 million to a ransomware gang to recover access to its systems following an attack in March, making it one the most expensive ransoms paid to date.  The development was first&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by Bloomberg, citing "people with knowledge of the attack." The adversary that staged the intrusion is said to have allegedly demanded $60 million a week after the Chicago-based company began negotiations with the hackers, culminating in the payment two weeks following the theft of company data.  In a statement shared on May 12, CNA Financial&nbsp; said &nbsp;it had "no evidence to indicate that external customers were potentially at risk of infection due to the incident."   The attack has been attributed to new ransomware known as 'Phoenix CryptoLocker,' according to a&nbsp; March report &nbsp;from Bleeping Computer, with the strain believed to be an offshoot of&nbsp; WastedLocker &nbsp;and Hades, both of which have been utilized by&nbsp; Evil Corp , a Ru

Watering Hole Attack Was Used to Target Florida Water Utilities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/watering-hole-attack-was-used-to-target.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An investigation undertaken in the aftermath of the&nbsp; Oldsmar water plant hack &nbsp;earlier this year has revealed that an infrastructure contractor in the U.S. state of Florida hosted malicious code on its website in what's known as a watering hole attack.  "This malicious code seemingly targeted water utilities, particularly in Florida, and more importantly, was visited by a browser from the city of Oldsmar on the same day of the poisoning event," Dragos researcher Kent Backman&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published on Tuesday.  The site, which belongs to a Florida-based general contractor involved in building water and wastewater treatment facilities, had no bearing on the intrusion, the American industrial cybersecurity firm said.   Watering hole attacks typically allow an adversary to compromise a specific group of end-users by compromising a carefully selected website, which members of that group are known to visit, with an intention to gain access to the victim's system an

70 European and South American Banks Under Attack By Bizarro Banking Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/70-european-and-south-american-banks.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A financially motivated cybercrime gang has unleashed a previously undocumented banking trojan, which can steal credentials from customers of 70 banks located in various European and South American countries.  Dubbed " Bizarro " by Kaspersky researchers, the Windows malware is "using affiliates or recruiting money mules to operationalize their attacks, cashing out or simply to helping [sic] with transfers."  The campaign consists of multiple moving parts, chief among them being the ability to trick users into entering two-factor authentication codes in fake pop-up windows that are then sent to the attackers, as well as its reliance on social engineering lures to convince visitors of banking websites into downloading a malicious smartphone app.   Bizarro, which uses compromised WordPress, Amazon, and Azure servers to host the malware, is distributed via MSI packages downloaded by victims from sketchy links in spam emails.

New Browser Attack Allows Tracking Users Online With JavaScript Disabled<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/new-browser-attack-allows-tracking.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have discovered a new side-channel that they say can be reliably exploited to leak information from web browsers that could then be leveraged to track users even when JavaScript is completely disabled.  "This is a side-channel attack which doesn't require any JavaScript to run," the researchers said. "This means script blockers cannot stop it. The attacks work even if you strip out all of the fun parts of the web browsing experience. This makes it very difficult to prevent without modifying deep parts of the operating system."  In avoiding JavaScript, the side-channel attacks are also architecturally agnostic, resulting in microarchitectural website fingerprinting attacks that work across hardware platforms, including Intel Core, AMD Ryzen, Samsung Exynos 2100, and Apple M1 CPUs — making it the first known side-channel attack on the iPhone maker's new ARM-based chipsets.

Microsoft Exchange Cyber Attack — What Do We Know So Far?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/microsoft-exchange-cyber-attack-what-do.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Friday warned of active attacks exploiting unpatched Exchange Servers carried out by multiple threat actors, as the hacking campaign is believed to have infected tens of thousands of businesses, government entities in the U.S., Asia, and Europe.  The company&nbsp; said &nbsp;"it continues to see increased use of these vulnerabilities in attacks targeting unpatched systems by multiple malicious actors beyond HAFNIUM," signaling an escalation that the breaches are no longer "limited and targeted" as was previously deemed.  According to independent cybersecurity journalist&nbsp; Brian Krebs , at least 30,000 entities across the U.S. — mainly small businesses, towns, cities, and local governments — have been compromised by an "unusually aggressive" Chinese group that has set its sights on stealing emails from victim organizations by exploiting previously undisclosed flaws in Exchange Server.   Victims are also being reported from outside the U.S., with email sy

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's a case of hackers getting hacked, a prominent underground online criminal forum by the name of Maza has been compromised by unknown attackers, making it the fourth forum to have been breached since the start of the year.  The intrusion is said to have occurred on March 3, with information about the forum members — including usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords — publicly disclosed on a breach notification page put up by the attackers, stating "Your data has been leaked" and "This forum has been hacked."  "The announcement was accompanied by a PDF file allegedly containing a portion of forum user data. The file comprised more than 3,000 rows, containing usernames, partially obfuscated password hashes, email addresses and other contact details," cybersecurity firm Intel 471&nbsp; said .   Originally called Mazafaka, Maza is an elite, invite-only Russian-language cybercrime forum known to be operational as early as 2003, acting as an exc

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As cybersecurity researchers continue to piece together the sprawling&nbsp; SolarWinds supply chain attack , top executives of the Texas-based software services firm blamed an intern for a critical password lapse that went unnoticed for several years.&nbsp;  The said password " solarwinds123 " was originally believed to have been publicly accessible via a GitHub repository since June 17, 2018, before the misconfiguration was addressed on November 22, 2019.  But in a&nbsp; hearing &nbsp;before the House Committees on Oversight and Reform and Homeland Security on SolarWinds on Friday, CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna testified that the password had been in use as early as 2017.  While a preliminary investigation into the attack revealed that the operators behind the espionage campaign managed to compromise the software build and code signing infrastructure of SolarWinds Orion platform as early as October 2019 to deliver the Sunburst backdoor, Crowdstrike's incident response efforts pointed to a&nbsp; revi

Experts Warns of Notable Increase in QuickBooks Data Files Theft Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/experts-warns-of-notable-increase-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has uncovered a significant increase in QuickBooks file data theft using social engineering tricks to deliver malware and exploit the accounting software.  "A majority of the time, the attack involves basic malware that is often signed, making it hard to detect using antivirus or other threat detection software," researchers from ThreatLocker said in an analysis shared today with The Hacker News.  QuickBooks is an accounting software package developed and marketed by Intuit.   The spear-phishing attacks take the form of a PowerShell command that's capable of running inside of the email, the researchers said, adding, a second attack vector involves decoy documents sent via email messages that, when opened, runs a macro to download malicious code which uploads QuickBooks files to an attacker-controlled server.  Alternatively, bad actors have also been spotted running a PowerShell command called&nbsp; Invoke-WebRequests &nbsp;on target systems to upload relevant data to

Shadow Attacks Let Attackers Replace Content in Digitally Signed PDFs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/shadow-attacks-let-attackers-replace.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have demonstrated a novel class of attacks that could allow a bad actor to potentially circumvent existing countermeasures and break the integrity protection of digitally signed PDF documents.  Called " Shadow attacks " by academics from Ruhr-University Bochum, the technique uses the "enormous flexibility provided by the PDF specification so that shadow documents remain standard-compliant."  The findings were presented yesterday at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), with 16 of the 29 PDF viewers tested — including Adobe Acrobat, Foxit Reader, Perfect PDF, and Okular — found vulnerable to shadow attacks.  To carry out the attack, a malicious actor creates a PDF document with two different contents: one which is the content that's expected by the party signing the document, and the other, a piece of hidden content that gets displayed once the PDF is signed.  "The signers of the PDF receive the document, review it, and s

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a&nbsp;novel attack&nbsp;that could allow criminals to trick a point of sale terminal into transacting with a victim's Mastercard contactless card while believing it to be a Visa card.  The research, published by a group of academics from the ETH Zurich, builds on a study&nbsp; detailed last September &nbsp;that delved into a PIN bypass attack, permitting bad actors to leverage a victim's stolen or lost Visa EMV-enabled credit card for making high-value purchases without knowledge of the card's PIN, and even fool the terminal into accepting unauthentic offline card transactions.  "This is not just a mere card brand mixup but it has critical consequences," researchers David Basin, Ralf Sasse, and Jorge Toro said. "For example, criminals can use it in combination with the previous attack on Visa to also bypass the PIN for Mastercard cards. The cards of this brand were previously presumed protected by PIN."

Poor Password Security Lead to Recent Water Treatment Facility Hack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/poor-password-security-lead-to-recent.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New details have emerged about the remote computer intrusion at a Florida water treatment  facility last Friday, highlighting a lack of adequate security measures needed to bulletproof critical infrastructure environments.  The breach, which occurred last Friday, involved an&nbsp; unsuccessful attempt &nbsp;on the part of an adversary to increase sodium hydroxide dosage in the water supply to dangerous levels by remotely accessing the SCADA system at the water treatment plant. The system's plant operator, who spotted the intrusion, quickly took steps to reverse the command, leading to minimal impact.   Now, according to an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;published on Wednesday by the state of Massachusetts, unidentified cyber actors accessed the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system via TeamViewer software installed on one of the plant's several computers that were connected to the control system.  Not only were these computers running 32-bit versions of the Windows 7 operating system, but

Dependency Confusion Supply-Chain Attack Hit Over 35 High-Profile Companies<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/dependency-confusion-supply-chain.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's a novel supply chain attack, a security researcher managed to breach over 35 major companies' internal systems, including that of Microsoft, Apple, PayPal, Shopify, Netflix, Yelp, Tesla, and Uber, and achieve remote code execution.  The technique, called dependency confusion  or a substitution attack, takes advantage of the fact that a piece of software may include components from a mix of private and public sources.  These external package dependencies, which are fetched from public repositories during a build process, can pose an attack opportunity when an adversary uploads a higher version of a private module to the public feed, causing a client to automatically download the bogus "latest" version without requiring any action from the developer.   "From one-off mistakes made by developers on their own machines, to misconfigured internal or cloud-based build servers, to systemically vulnerable development pipelines, one thing was clear: squatting val

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly devised variant of the&nbsp; NAT Slipstreaming attack &nbsp;can be leveraged to compromise and expose any device in an internal network, according to the latest research.  Detailed by enterprise IoT security firm Armis, the&nbsp; new attack &nbsp;(CVE-2020-16043 and CVE-2021-23961) builds on the previously disclosed technique to bypass routers and firewalls and reach any unmanaged device within the internal network from the Internet.  First&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by security researcher Samy Kamkar in late October 2020, the JavaScript-based attack relied on luring a user into visiting a malicious website to circumvent browser-based port restrictions and allow the attacker to remotely access TCP/UDP services on the victim's device, even those that were protected by a firewall or NAT.   Although partial mitigations were released on November 11 to thwart the attack in&nbsp; Chrome 87 ,&nbsp; Firefox 84 , and&nbsp; Safari &nbsp;by preventing connections on port 5060 or 5061, Armis researchers Ben Seri and Gregory Vishnipolsky r

New Attack Could Let Hackers Clone Your Google Titan 2FA Security Keys<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/new-attack-could-let-hackers-clone-your.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Hardware security keys—such as those from Google and Yubico—are considered the most secure means to protect accounts from phishing and takeover attacks.  But a new research published on Thursday demonstrates how an adversary in possession of such a two-factor authentication (2FA) device can clone it by exploiting an electromagnetic side-channel in the chip embedded in it.  The vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2021-3011 ) allows the bad actor to extract the encryption key or the&nbsp; ECDSA &nbsp;private key linked to a victim's account from a FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) device like Google Titan Key or YubiKey, thus completely undermining the 2FA protections.  "The adversary can sign in to the victim's application account without the U2F device, and without the victim noticing," NinjaLab researchers Victor Lomne and Thomas Roche&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a 60-page analysis.   "In other words the adversary created a clone of the U2F device for the victim's application account. This cl
