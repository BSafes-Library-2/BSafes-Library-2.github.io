<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has announced plans to add a new feature in the upcoming version of its Chrome web browser to alert users when an extension they have installed has been removed from the Chrome Web Store. The feature, set for release alongside Chrome 117, allows users to be notified when an add-on has been unpublished by a developer, taken down for violating Chrome Web Store policy, or marked as malware. The tech giant said it intends to highlight such extensions under a "Safety check" category in the "Privacy and security" section of the browser settings page. "When a user clicks 'Review,' they will be taken to their extensions and given the choice to either remove the extension or hide the warning if they wish to keep the extension installed," Oliver Dunk, a developer relations engineer for Chrome extensions,&nbsp; said . "As in previous versions of Chrome, extensions marked as malware are automatically disabled." The development comes as the c

More and more organizations are choosing Google Workspace as their default employee toolset of choice. But despite the productivity advantages, this organizational action also incurs a new security debt. Security teams now have to find a way to adjust their security architecture to this new cloud workload. Some teams may rely on their existing network security solutions. According to a&nbsp; new guide , this is a hit and a miss. Network solutions, the guide claims, just don't cover all SaaS and browsing requirements. Meanwhile, Google offers a wide range of native security functionalities built-in to Chrome. These functionalities enable the organization to leverage the browser for consolidating security, simplifying operations and reducing costs. If you're wary about trusting Chrome with your security, then the guide is recommended to read. In great detail, it explains which security features Chrome offers users.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has introduced a new security feature in Android 14 that allows IT administrators to disable support for 2G cellular networks in their managed device fleet. The search giant said it's introducing a second user setting to turn off support, at the model level, for&nbsp; null-ciphered cellular connections . "The Android Security Model assumes that all networks are hostile to keep users safe from network packet injection, tampering, or eavesdropping on user traffic," Roger Piqueras Jover, Yomna Nasser, and Sudhi Herle&nbsp; said . "Android does not rely on link-layer encryption to address this threat model. Instead, Android establishes that all network traffic should be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)." 2G networks, in particular, employ weak encryption and lack mutual authentication,&nbsp; rendering &nbsp;them&nbsp; susceptible &nbsp;to over-the-air interception and traffic decryption attacks by impersonating a real 2G tower.

Apple has announced plans to require developers to submit reasons to use certain APIs in their apps starting later this year with the release of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS Sonoma, tvOS 17, and watchOS 10 to prevent their abuse for data collection. "This will help ensure that apps only use these APIs for their intended purpose," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. "As part of this process, you'll need to select one or more approved reasons that accurately reflect how your app uses the API, and your app can only use the API for the reasons you've selected." The APIs that&nbsp; require &nbsp;reasons for use relate to the following - File timestamp APIs System boot time APIs Disk space APIs Active keyboard APIs, and User defaults APIs The iPhone maker said it's making the move to ensure that such APIs are not abused by app developers to collect device signals to carry out&nbsp; fingerprinting , which could be employed to&nbsp; uniquely identify users &nbsp;across different a

Cyber threat intelligence is an effective weapon in the ongoing battle to protect digital assets and infrastructure - especially when combined with AI. But AI is only as good as the data feeding it. Access to unique, underground sources is key. Threat Intelligence offers tremendous value to people and companies. At the same time, its ability to address organizations' cybersecurity needs and the benefits it offers vary by company, industry, and other factors. A common challenge with cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is that the data it produces can be vast and overwhelming, creating confusion and inefficiencies among security teams' threat exposure management efforts. Additionally, organizations have different levels of security maturity, which can make access to and understanding of CTI data difficult. Enter generative AI. Many cybersecurity companies – and more specifically, threat intelligence companies – are bringing generative AI to market to simplify threat intelligence a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the business environment becomes increasingly connected, organizations' attack surfaces continue to expand, making it challenging to map and secure both known and unknown assets. In particular, unknown assets present security challenges related to shadow IT, misconfigurations, ineffective scan coverage, among others. Given attack surface sprawl and evolving threats, many organizations are embracing&nbsp; attack surface management (ASM) &nbsp;tools to discover and address critical exposures. Asset discovery is an important capability to have, and one that's helping to drive the adoption of attack surface management tools and services. That said, asset discovery is only one aspect of effective attack surface management. Making the attack surface as impenetrable as possible takes offensive security that goes far beyond the discovery phase. Why Asset Discovery Isn't Enough&nbsp; Given the complexity and ever-expanding scale of the digital infrastructure at most companies, cataloging all the known

The Quick Serve Restaurant (QSR) industry is built on consistency and shared resources. National chains like McDonald's and regional ones like Cracker Barrel grow faster by reusing the same business model, decor, and menu, with little change from one location to the next.&nbsp; QSR technology stacks mirror the consistency of the front end of each store. Despite each franchise being independently owned and operated, they share subscriptions to SaaS applications, or use multiple tenants of the same application. Each app is typically segmented by store. Corporate IT and Security has access to the entire database, while each franchise has visibility into its own data.&nbsp; These SaaS apps cover everything from CRMs to supply chains to marketing and HR. The data within is used to understand consumer habits, improve marketing campaigns, and manage employees. Like every other industry, QSR SaaS apps contain a wealth of data that needs to be secured.&nbsp; At the same time, we're seeing food cha

IT hygiene&nbsp; is a security best practice that ensures that digital assets in an organization's environment are secure and running properly. Good IT hygiene includes vulnerability management, security configuration assessments, maintaining asset and system inventories, and comprehensive visibility into the activities occurring in an environment. As technology advances and the tools used by cybercriminals and cybersecurity professionals evolve, the strategies used to carry out cyber attacks differ based on their complexity and uniqueness. Threat actors continuously target organizations practicing poor IT hygiene to exploit known security weaknesses and human error. Security administrators can defend against cyberattacks by implementing good&nbsp; IT hygiene &nbsp;practices like whitelisting programs, keeping systems up to date, and more.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Python Package Index (PyPI) announced last week that every account that maintains a project on the official third-party software repository will be required to turn on two-factor authentication ( 2FA ) by the end of the year. "Between now and the end of the year, PyPI will begin gating access to certain site functionality based on 2FA usage," PyPI administrator Donald Stufft said. "In addition, we may begin selecting certain users or projects for early enforcement." The enforcement also includes&nbsp; organization maintainers , but does not extend to every single user of the service. The goal is to neutralize the threats posed by account takeover attacks, which an attacker can leverage to distribute trojanized versions of popular packages to poison the software supply chain and deploy malware on a large scale. PyPI, like other open source repositories such as npm, has&nbsp; witnessed &nbsp;innumerable instances of malware and package impersonation. Earlier this month, F

A hospital with 2,000 employees in the E.U. deployed Cynet protections across its environment. The hospital was in the process of upgrading several expensive imaging systems that were still supported by Windows XP and Windows 7 machines. Cynet protections were in place on most of the Windows XP and Windows 7 machines during the upgrade process, ensuring that legacy operating systems would not cause vulnerabilities or delay the activation of an&nbsp; incident response plan . The hospital's I.T. security team appreciated this coverage after their previous provider abandoned support for Windows XP and Windows 7. "One of the many reasons we chose Cynet was their support of legacy Windows machines. It's expensive, difficult and time consuming to upgrade our imaging system software, but we needed protections as we slowly migrated to more current Windows environments. Cynet was one of the few providers that continue to protect these older Windows environments." The Attack Alo

What to Look for When Selecting a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Solution<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/what-to-look-for-when-selecting-static.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
If you're involved in securing the applications your organization develops, there is no question that Static Application Security Testing (SAST) solutions are an important part of a comprehensive application security strategy. SAST secures software, supports business more securely, cuts down on costs, reduces risk, and speeds time to development, delivery, and deployment of mission-critical applications.&nbsp; SAST scans code early during development, so your AppSec team won't be scrambling to fix unexpected vulnerabilities right before that big launch is planned. You'll avoid surprises and launch delays without inadvertently releasing risky software to customers — or into production.&nbsp; But if you consider SAST as a part of a larger AppSec platform, crucial for those who wish to&nbsp; shift security everywhere &nbsp;possible in the software development life cycle (SDLC), some SAST solutions outshine others.&nbsp; Knowing what to focus on With a plethora of players in the market, sometimes

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Software is rarely a one-and-done proposition. In fact, any application available today will likely need to be updated – or patched – to fix bugs,&nbsp; address vulnerabilities , and update key features at multiple points in the future. With the typical enterprise relying on a multitude of applications, servers, and end-point devices in their day-to-day operations, the acquisition of a robust&nbsp; patch management platform &nbsp;to identify, test, deploy, install, and document all appropriate patches are critical for ensuring systems remain stable and secure.&nbsp; As with most tech tools, not all patch management solutions are created equal, and what's seen as robust by one organization may prove inadequate for another. However, an evaluation that begins with a focus on specific key criteria – essential attributes and functionality likely to be offered by many vendors but not all – will allow IT teams to narrow down their options as they work to identify the best solution for their organization&amp;

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Operational technology (OT) cybersecurity is a challenging but critical aspect of protecting organizations' essential systems and resources. Cybercriminals no longer break into systems, but instead log in – making access security more complex and also more important to manage and control than ever before. In an effort to solve the access-related challenges facing OT and critical infrastructure operators, the team at Cyolo built a zero-trust access platform designed to meet the unique safety, security, and uptime requirements of OT and industrial control systems (ICS) environments. Let's look under the hood:&nbsp; The Cyolo solution is a high-powered combination of Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), Identity Provider (IdP), and Privileged Access Management (PAM). What makes this approach stand out from the pack is that other ZTNA solutions do not offer IdP or PAM capabilities, while Identity and Access Management tools (IdPs and PAMs) do not extend connectivity.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Almost five months after Google&nbsp; added support &nbsp;for passkeys to its Chrome browser, the tech giant has begun rolling out the&nbsp; passwordless solution &nbsp;across Google Accounts on all platforms. Passkeys , backed by the FIDO Alliance, are a more secure way to sign in to apps and websites without having to use a traditional password. This, in turn, can be achieved by simply unlocking their computer or mobile device with their biometrics (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition) or a local PIN. "And, unlike passwords, passkeys are resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes," Google&nbsp; noted . Passkeys, once created, are locally stored on the device, and are not shared with any other party. This also obviates the need for setting up two-factor authentication, as it proves that "you have access to your device and are able to unlock it." Users also have the choice of creating passkeys for every device they use to

Managing vulnerabilities in the constantly evolving technological landscape is a difficult task. Although vulnerabilities emerge regularly, not all vulnerabilities present the same level of risk. Traditional metrics such as CVSS score or the number of vulnerabilities are insufficient for effective vulnerability management as they lack business context, prioritization, and understanding of attackers' opportunities. Vulnerabilities only represent a small part of the attack surface that attackers can leverage. Initially, organizations used manual methods to address known security weaknesses, but as technology and cyber threats evolved, a more automated and comprehensive approach became necessary. However, legacy vulnerability management tools were designed primarily for compliance and modern tools still face challenges in prioritization and limited resources, especially in dynamic and agile cloud environments.

Google on Thursday outlined a set of initiatives aimed at improving the vulnerability management ecosystem and establishing greater transparency measures around exploitation. "While the notoriety of zero-day vulnerabilities typically makes headlines, risks remain even after they're known and fixed, which is the real story," the company said in an announcement. "Those risks span everything from lag time in OEM adoption, patch testing pain points, end user update issues and more." Security threats also stem from incomplete patches applied by vendors, with a chunk of the zero-days exploited in the wild turning out to be variants of previously patched vulnerabilities. Mitigating such risks requires addressing the root cause of the vulnerabilities and prioritizing modern secure software development practices to eliminate entire classes of threats and block potential attack avenues.

Microsoft Tightens OneNote Security by Auto-Blocking 120 Risky File Extensions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/microsoft-tightens-onenote-security-by.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has announced plans to automatically block embedded files with "dangerous extensions" in OneNote following reports that the note-taking service is being&nbsp; increasingly abused &nbsp;for malware delivery. Up until now, users were shown a dialog warning them that opening such attachments could harm their computer and data, but it was possible to dismiss the prompt and open the files. That's going to change going forward. Microsoft said it intends to prevent users from directly opening an embedded file with a dangerous extension and display the message: "Your administrator has blocked your ability to open this file type in OneNote." The update is expected to start rolling out with Version 2304 later this month and only impacts OneNote for Microsoft 365 on devices running Windows. It does not affect other platforms, including macOS, Android, and iOS, as well as OneNote versions available on the web and for Windows 10. "By default, OneNote blocks the sa

Cyberstorage: Leveraging the Multi-Cloud to Combat Data Exfiltration<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/cyberstorage-leveraging-multi-cloud-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multi-cloud data storage, once merely a byproduct of the great cloud migration, has now become a strategy for data management. "Multi-cloud by design," and its companion the supercloud, is an ecosystem in which several cloud systems work together to provide many organizational benefits, including increased scale and overall resiliency. And now, even security teams who have long been the holdout on wide-scale cloud adoption, may find a reason to rejoice. Born out of the multi-cloud approach, cyberstorage enables companies to not only enjoy the benefits that multi-cloud brings but also eliminate the risk of data exposure at the same time, marking the beginning of the multi-cloud maturity era. What Is The Supercloud? While many organizations ended up with multiple cloud services as a byproduct of interdepartmental needs, today organizations are intentionally building multi-cloud environments. And rather than manage the various cloud services individually, many are implementin

Malicious actors are constantly adapting their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to adapt to political, technological, and regulatory changes quickly. A few emerging threats that organizations of all sizes should be aware of include the following: Increased use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning : Malicious actors are increasingly leveraging AI and machine learning to automate their attacks, allowing them to scale their operations faster than ever before. The exploitation of cloud-based technologies: &nbsp;Cloud-based services are increasingly being targeted by malicious actors due to the lack of visibility and control over these platforms. Increased use of ransomware: &nbsp;Ransomware is becoming a more popular method of attack, allowing malicious actors to monetize their operations quickly.

Think of the typical portrayal of a cyberattack. Bad guy pounding furiously on a keyboard, his eyes peeking out from under a dark hoodie. At long last, his efforts pay off and he hits the right combination of keys. "I'm in!" he shouts in triumph. Clearly, there are many problems with this scenario – and it's not just the hoodie. What's even more inaccurate is that most cyber attackers today do not rely on unsophisticated methods like brute force. Instead, they target users directly through social engineering, spearphishing and business email compromise (BEC). In light of this, it can be said that cybercriminals no longer break into corporate systems; instead, they log in with valid user credentials. In this landscape of highly targeted cyberattacks, the identity perimeter has emerged as a crucial battlefield. Unfortunately, too many businesses continue to rely on outdated security strategies and tools that leave their users and sensitive systems unprotected. S

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As threats grow and attack surfaces get more complex, companies continue to struggle with the multitude of tools they utilize to handle endpoint security and management. This can leave gaps in an enterprise's ability to identify devices that are accessing the network and in ensuring that those devices are compliant with security policies. These gaps are often seen in outdated spreadsheets that are used to track and manage asset inventory, configurations, vulnerabilities, and more. Ultimately, this increases organizational risk while stifling efficiency and productivity. That's why unified security and endpoint management has gained ground, as noted in&nbsp; Gartner's Hype Cycle for Endpoint Security, 2022 . As part of the market's need to gain a clearer, real-time picture of their devices and security posture, Syxsense launched its Enterprise platform last year to address the three key elements of endpoint management and security: vulnerabilities, patch, and compliance.

Gmail and Google Calendar Now Support Client-Side Encryption (CSE) to Boost Data Privacy<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/gmail-and-google-calendar-now-support.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has announced the general availability of client-side encryption (CSE) for Gmail and Calendar, months after&nbsp; piloting the feature &nbsp;in late 2022. The data privacy controls enable "even more organizations to become arbiters of their own data and the sole party deciding who has access to it," Google's Ganesh Chilakapati and Andy Wen&nbsp; said . To that end, users can send and receive emails or create meeting events within their organizations or to other external parties in a manner that's encrypted "before it reaches Google servers." The company is also making available a&nbsp; decrypter tool &nbsp;in beta for Windows to decrypt client-side encrypted files and emails exported via its Data Export tool or Google Vault. macOS and Linux versions of the decrypter are expected to be released in the future. The development follows the&nbsp; rollout of CSE &nbsp;to other products such as Google Drive, Docs, Slides, Sheets, and Meet. The solution, the tech behemoth said, is aimed

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Samsung has announced a new feature called Message Guard that comes with safeguards to protect users from malware and spyware via what's referred to as zero-click attacks . The South Korean chaebol said the solution "preemptively" secures users' devices by "limiting exposure to invisible threats disguised as image attachments." The security feature, available on Samsung Messages and Google Messages, is currently limited to the Samsung Galaxy S23 series, with plans to expand it to other Galaxy smartphones and tablets later this year that are running on One UI 5.1 or higher. Zero-click attacks are highly-targeted and sophisticated attacks that exploit previously unknown flaws (i.e., zero-days) in software to trigger execution of malicious code without requiring any user interaction. Unlike traditional methods of remotely exploiting a device wherein threat actors rely on phishing tactics to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link or opening an rog

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The use of software as a service (SaaS) is experiencing rapid growth and shows no signs of slowing down. Its decentralized and easy-to-use nature is beneficial for increasing employee productivity, but it also poses many security and IT challenges. Keeping track of all the SaaS applications that have been granted access to an organization's data is a difficult task. Understanding the risks that SaaS applications pose is just as important, but it can be challenging to secure what cannot be seen. Many organizations have implemented access management solutions, but these are limited in visibility to only pre-approved applications. The average medium-sized organization has hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of SaaS applications that have been adopted by employees who needed a quick and easy solution or found a free version, completely bypassing IT and security. This leads to a significant risk as many of these applications do not have the necessary security and/or compliance standard

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
When considering authentication providers, many organizations consider the ease of configuration, ubiquity of usage, and technical stability. Organizations cannot always be judged on those metrics alone. There is an increasing need to evaluate company ownership, policies and the stability, or instability, that it brings. How Leadership Change Affects Stability In recent months, a salient example is that of Twitter. The Twitter platform has been around since 2006 and is used by millions worldwide. With many users and a seemingly robust authentication system, organizations used Twitter as a primary or secondary authentication service. Inconsistent leadership and policies mean the stability of a platform is subject to change, which is especially true with Twitter as of late. The ownership change to Elon Musk precipitated widespread changes to staffing and policies. Due to those changes,&nbsp; a large portion of staff was let go , but this included many individuals responsible for the techn

Popular instant messaging service WhatsApp has launched support for proxy servers in the latest version of its Android and iOS apps, letting users circumvent government-imposed censorship and internet shutdowns. "Choosing a proxy enables you to connect to WhatsApp through servers set up by volunteers and organizations around the world dedicated to helping people communicate freely," the Meta-owned company&nbsp; said .

The latest breach announced by LastPass is a major cause for concern to security stakeholders. As often occurs, we are at a security limbo – on the one hand, as LastPass has noted, users who followed LastPass best practices would be exposed to practically zero to extremely low risk. However, to say that password best practices are not followed is a wild understatement. The reality is that there are very few organizations in which these practices are truly enforced. This puts security teams in the worst position, where exposure to compromise is almost certain, but pinpointing the users who created this exposure is almost impossible.&nbsp; To assist them throughout this challenging time, Browser Security solution LayerX has launched a free offering of its platform, enabling security teams to gain visibility into all browsers on which the LastPass extension is installed and mitigate the potential impacts of the LastPass breach on their environments by informing vulnerable users and require t

Internet behemoth Google on Tuesday said it plans to roll out Privacy Sandbox for Android in beta to mobile devices running Android 13 starting early next year.  "The Privacy Sandbox Beta will be available for ad tech and app developers who wish to test the ads-related APIs as part of their solutions," the company&nbsp; said .  To that end, developers will need to complete an enrollment process in order to utilize the ads-related APIs, including&nbsp; Topics ,&nbsp; FLEDGE , and&nbsp; Attribution Reporting .   Topics, which&nbsp; replaced &nbsp;Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) earlier this year, aims to categorize user interests under different "topics" based on their device web browsing history. These inferred interests are then shared with marketers to serve targeted ads.  FLEDGE and Attribution reporting, on the other hand, enable custom audience targeting and help measure&nbsp; ad conversions &nbsp;without relying on cross-party user identifiers, respectively.  Organizations can also request acce

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Thursday announced that it's seeking contributors to a new open source initiative called Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition , also known as GUAC, as part of its ongoing efforts to beef up the&nbsp; software supply chain .  "GUAC addresses a need created by the burgeoning efforts across the ecosystem to generate software build, security, and dependency metadata," Brandon Lum, Mihai Maruseac, and Isaac Hepworth of Google said  in a post shared with The Hacker News.  "GUAC is meant to democratize the availability of this security information by making it freely accessible and useful for every organization, not just those with enterprise-scale security and IT funding."   Software supply chain has&nbsp; emerged &nbsp;a&nbsp; lucrative &nbsp; attack vector &nbsp;for threat actors, wherein exploiting just one weakness -- as seen in the case of&nbsp; SolarWinds &nbsp;and&nbsp; Log4Shell &nbsp;-- opens a pathway long enough to traverse down the supply chain and steal sensitive data, plant malware, a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As software supply chain security becomes more and more crucial, security, DevSecOps, and DevOps teams are more challenged than ever to build transparent trust in the software they deliver or use. In fact, in Gartner recently published their 2022 cybersecurity predictions - not only do they anticipate the continued expansion of attack surfaces in the near future, they also list digital supply chain as a major rising attack surface and one of the top trends to follow in 2022.  After all, any software is only as secure as the weakest link in its supply chain. One bad component, any malicious access to your development environment—or any vulnerability in your software's delivery life cycle—and you risk your code's integrity, your customers, and your reputation.&nbsp;  Scribe Security &nbsp;recently launched a new platform that claims to address these urgent needs by enabling its users to build trust in their software across teams and organizations.

Google Rolling Out Passkey Passwordless Login Support to Android and Chrome<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/google-rolling-out-passkey-passwordless.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Wednesday officially rolled out support for passkeys, the next-generation authentication standard, to both Android and Chrome.  "Passkeys are a significantly safer replacement for passwords and other phishable authentication factors," the tech giant&nbsp; said . "They cannot be reused, don't leak in server breaches, and protect users from phishing attacks."   The feature was&nbsp; first announced &nbsp;in May 2022 as part of a broader push to support a common passwordless sign-in standard.  Passkeys, established by the FIDO Alliance and also backed by&nbsp; Apple and Microsoft , aim to replace standard passwords with unique digital keys that are stored locally on the device.   To that end, creating a passkey requires confirmation from the end-user about the account that will be used to log in to the online service, followed by using their biometric information or the&nbsp; device &nbsp; passcode .  Signing in to a website on a mobile device is also a simple two-step process that e

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Organizations struggle to find ways to keep a good security posture. This is because it is difficult to create secure system policies and find the right tools that help achieve a good posture. In many cases, organizations work with tools that do not integrate with each other and are expensive to purchase and maintain.  Security posture management is a term used to describe the process of identifying and mitigating security misconfigurations and compliance risks in an organization. To maintain a good security posture, organizations should at least do the following:   Maintain inventory: &nbsp;Asset inventory is considered first because it provides a comprehensive list of all IT assets that should be protected. This includes the hardware devices, applications, and services that are being used.  Perform vulnerability assessment: &nbsp;The next step is to perform a vulnerability assessment to identify weaknesses in applications and services. Knowledge of the vulnerabilities help to prioritize risks

As threat complexity increases and the boundaries of an organization have all but disappeared, security teams are more challenged than ever to deliver consistent security outcomes. One company aiming to help security teams meet this challenge is&nbsp; Stellar Cyber .&nbsp;  Stellar Cyber claims to address the needs of MSSPs by providing capabilities typically found in NG-SIEM, NDR, and SOAR products in their Open XDR platform, managed with a single license. According to Stellar Cyber, this consolidation means faster security analyst ramp time and customer onboarding with far less manually intensive tasks required. Stellar Cyber currently counts 20+ of the top MSSP providers as customers, providing security for over 3 million assets. In addition, stellar Cyber claims after deployment, users see up to 20x faster mean time to respond (MTTR), a bold claim.

Unified Threat Management: The All-in-One Cybersecurity Solution<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/unified-threat-management-all-in-one.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
UTM (Unified threat management) is thought to be an all-in-one solution for cybersecurity. In general, it is a versatile software or hardware firewall solution integrated with IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and other security services. A universal gateway allows the user to manage network security with one comprehensive solution, which makes the task much easier. In addition, compared to a conventional firewall, such systems are capable of detecting and blocking more sophisticated attacks. SafeDNS has recently released such a solution, and this is what this article is going to be about.  Who needs UTMs?  Most of all, UTMs are valued by SMEs - the all-in-one solution makes it simple to manage all their cybersecurity solutions and services. This also cuts down a lot of communications between vendors, since UTMs are easily supported by one IT team. This leads to another upside of the system - it can be cost-effective, as there is no need to pay a bunch of vendors &amp; extra for tech

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Social media company Meta said it will begin testing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on its Messenger platform this week for select users as the default option, as the company continues to slowly add security layers to its various chat services.  "If you're in the test group, some of your most frequent chats may be automatically end-to-end encrypted, which means you won't have to opt in to the feature," Sara Su, product management director of Messenger Trust,&nbsp; said .  The incremental development comes a year after it&nbsp; turned on E2EE &nbsp;for audio and video calls on the messaging service as well as for one-on-one chats in Instagram, and enabled&nbsp; encrypted chat backups &nbsp;for WhatsApp on Android and iOS.   E2EE is a secure communication mechanism that scrambles data in transit and prevents third-parties from unauthorizedly accessing information sent from one endpoint to another, including Meta.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Back when the internet consisted of a handful of computers networked together across a few research institutions, nobody could have imagined that it would one day form the backbone of a new digital way of life. And that probably explains why none of the researchers who thought up its core technologies — things like packet switching and TCP/IP — gave much consideration to the need to secure the data passing through it.  But by 1989, hackers like Robert Morris had already spotted the security weaknesses of the fledgling global network and started to exploit them. And that was just the beginning. Today, network administrators and individual internet users spend significant amounts of time and money trying to keep their data safe from prying eyes.  The de-facto tool most people use for that purpose is a VPN. It's a software encryption solution that prevents anyone from accessing data traversing the public internet other than its intended recipient. And VPNs make up a data privacy mark

Microsoft Adds Default Protection Against RDP Brute-Force Attacks in Windows 11<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/microsoft-adds-default-protection.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is now taking steps to prevent Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute-force attacks as part of the latest builds for the Windows 11 operating system in an attempt to raise the&nbsp; security baseline &nbsp;to meet the evolving threat landscape.  To that end, the default policy for Windows 11 builds – particularly, Insider Preview builds 22528.1000 and newer – will automatically lock accounts for 10 minutes after 10 invalid sign-in attempts.  "Win11 builds now have a DEFAULT account lockout policy to mitigate RDP and other brute-force password vectors," David Weston, Microsoft's vice president for OS security and enterprise,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets last week. "This technique is very commonly used in Human Operated Ransomware and other attacks -- this control will make brute forcing much harder which is awesome!"   It's worth pointing out that while this&nbsp; account lockout setting &nbsp;is already incorporated in Windows 10, it's not enabled by default.  The f

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Growing cyber threats, tightening regulatory demands and strict cyber insurance requirements are driving small to medium-sized enterprises demand for strategic cybersecurity and compliance guidance and management. Since most companies this size don't have in-house CISO expertise – the demand for virtual CISO (vCISO) services is also growing. Yet current vCISO services models still rely on manual, humanCISO expertise. This makes these services costly and tough to scale – leaving MSPs, MSSPs and consulting firms unable to add vCISO service to their portfolio or scale their existing vCISO services to meet the growing demand.  This is the challenge&nbsp; Cynomi's Automated vCISO platform &nbsp;is trying to solve. The company's AI-powered vCISO platform automatically generates everything vCISO service providers need to provide their clients, fully customized for each and every client: risk and compliance assessments, gap analysis, tailored security policies, strategic remediation plans w

Google Adds Support for DNS-over-HTTP/3 in Android to Keep DNS Queries Private<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/google-adds-support-for-dns-over-http3.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday officially announced support for DNS-over-HTTP/3 (DoH3) for Android devices as part of a Google Play system update designed to keep DNS queries private.  To that end, Android smartphones running Android 11 and higher are expected to use DoH3 instead of DNS-over-TLS (DoT), which was incorporated into the mobile operating system with Android 9.0.  DoH3 is also an alternative to DNS-over-HTTPS ( DoH ), a mechanism for carrying out remote Domain Name System (DNS) resolution through an encrypted connection, effectively preventing third parties from snooping on users' browsing activities.   HTTP/3 , the first major upgrade to the hypertext transfer protocol since HTTP/2 was introduced in May 2015, is designed to use a new transport layer protocol called&nbsp; QUIC &nbsp;that's already supported by major browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.   The low-latency protocol, developed by Google in 2012, relies on the User Datagram Protoc

Microsoft on Monday announced the general availability of a feature called Autopatch  that automatically keeps Windows and Office software up-to-date on enrolled endpoints.  The launch, which comes a day before Microsoft is expected to release its monthly round of security patches, is available for customers with Windows Enterprise E3 and E5 licenses. It, however, doesn't support Windows Education (A3) or Windows Front Line Worker (F3) licenses.  "Microsoft will continue to release updates on the second Tuesday of every month and now Autopatch helps streamline updating operations and create new opportunities for IT pros," Lior Bela&nbsp; said .   Autopatch works by&nbsp; applying security updates &nbsp;first to devices in what's called the Test ring, which contains a minimum number of representative devices. After a validation period, the updates are pushed to the First (1% devices), Fast (9%), and Broad (90%) rings.   The service was first&nbsp; teased &nbsp;by the tech giant in April 2022

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the various measures ransomware actors have taken to obscure their true identity online as well as the hosting location of their web server infrastructure.  "Most ransomware operators use hosting providers outside their country of origin (such as Sweden, Germany, and Singapore) to host their ransomware operations sites," Cisco Talos researcher Paul Eubanks&nbsp; said . "They use VPS hop-points as a proxy to hide their true location when they connect to their ransomware web infrastructure for remote administration tasks."  Also prominent are the use of the TOR network and DNS proxy registration services to provide an added layer of anonymity for their illegal operations.  But by taking advantage of the threat actors' operational security missteps and other techniques, the cybersecurity firm disclosed last week that it was able to identify TOR hidden services hosted on public IP addresses, some of which are previously unknown in

Fixing indirect vulnerabilities is one of those complex, tedious and, quite frankly, boring tasks that no one really wants to touch. No one except for&nbsp; Debricked , it seems. Sure, there are lots of ways to do it manually, but can it be done automatically with minimal risk of breaking changes? The Debricked team decided to find out.&nbsp;  A forest full of fragile trees  So, where do you even start?  Firstly, there needs to be a way to fix the vulnerability, which, for indirect dependencies, is no walk in the park. Secondly, it needs to be done in a safe way, or, without anything breaking.&nbsp;  You see, indirect dependencies are introduced deep down the dependency tree and it's very tricky to get to the exact version you want. As Debricked's Head of R&amp;D once put it, " You are turning the knobs by playing around with your direct dependencies and praying to Torvalds that the correct indirect packages are resolved.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple has introduced a Rapid Security Response feature  in iOS 16 and macOS Ventura that's designed to deploy security fixes without the need for a full operating system version update.  "macOS security gets even stronger with new tools that make the Mac more resistant to attack, including Rapid Security Response that works in between normal updates to easily keep security up to date without a reboot," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement on Monday.  The feature, which also works on iOS , aims to separate regular software updates from critical security improvements and are applied automatically so that users are quickly protected against in-the-wild attacks  and unexpected threats. It's worth noting that Apple tested an analogous option  in iOS 14.5.   Rapid Security Response, viewed in that light, mirrors a similar approach taken by Google through Play Services  and Play Protect  to secure Android devices from malware and other kinds of fraud.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the threat landscape evolves and multiplies with more advanced attacks than ever, defending against these modern cyber threats is a monumental challenge for almost any organization.&nbsp;  Threat detection is about an organization's ability to accurately identify threats, be it to the network, an endpoint, another asset or an application – including cloud infrastructure and assets. At scale, threat detection analyzes the entire security infrastructure to identify malicious activity that could compromise the ecosystem.  Countless solutions support threat detection, but the key is to have as much data as possible available to bolster your security visibility. If you don't know what is happening on your systems, threat detection is impossible.&nbsp;  Deploying the right security software is critical for protecting you from threats.  What do we mean by threat detection software?  In the early days of threat detection, software was deployed to protect against different forms of malware. However,

SIM-based Authentication Aims to Transform Device Binding Security to End Phishing<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/sim-based-authentication-aims-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Let's face it: we all use email, and we all use passwords. Passwords create inherent vulnerability in the system. The success rate of phishing attacks is&nbsp; skyrocketing , and opportunities for the attack have greatly multiplied as lives moved online. All it takes is one password to be compromised for all other users to become victims of a data breach.&nbsp;  To deliver additional security, therefore, digital identities rely on verification plasters. MFA (multi-factor authentication) often falls back to knowledge factors such as password resets and OTP codes, but these are still vulnerable. As long as credentials can be shared or intercepted, they can be misused.&nbsp;  What is needed is a paradigm shift – from knowledge-based credentials to strong possession-factor security that can't be compromised, alongside other verification security such as biometrics.  A new possession-factor API now aims to do precisely that, replacing knowledge-based credentials, by using the SIM card for possess

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Thursday&nbsp; announced &nbsp;the creation of a new "Open Source Maintenance Crew" to focus on bolstering the security of critical open source projects.  Additionally, the tech giant pointed out&nbsp; Open Source Insights &nbsp;as a tool for analyzing packages and their dependency graphs, using it to determine "whether a vulnerability in a dependency might affect your code."  "With this information, developers can understand how their software is put together and the consequences to changes in their dependencies," the company said.  The development comes as security and trust in the open source software ecosystem has been increasingly thrown into question in the aftermath of a&nbsp; string &nbsp;of&nbsp; supply chain &nbsp; attacks &nbsp;designed to compromise developer workflows.   In December 2021, a critical flaw in the ubiquitous open source&nbsp; Log4j logging library &nbsp;left several companies scrambling to patch their systems against potential abuse.

Google on Wednesday took to its annual developer conference to announce a host of privacy and security updates, including support for virtual credit cards on Android and Chrome.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google today announced&nbsp; plans &nbsp;to implement support for passwordless logins in Android and the Chrome web browser to allow users to seamlessly and securely sign in across different devices and websites irrespective of the platform.  "This will simplify sign-ins across devices, websites, and applications no matter the platform — without the need for a single password," Google&nbsp; said .   Apple and Microsoft are also expected to extend the support to iOS, macOS, and Windows operating systems as well as Safari and Edge browsers.  The common Fast IDentity Online ( FIDO ) sign-in system does away with passwords entirely in favor of displaying a prompt asking a user to unlock the phone when signing into a website or an application.  This is made possible by storing a cryptographically-secured FIDO credential called a passkey on the phone that's used to log in to the online account after unlocking the device.

Use This Definitive RFP Template to Effectively Evaluate XDR solutions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/07/extended-detection-response.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new class of security tools is emerging that promises to significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of threat detection and response.   Emerging Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solutions aim to aggregate and correlate telemetry from multiple detection controls and then synthesize response actions.   XDR has been referred to as the next step in the evolution of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.   Because XDR represents a new solution category, there is no single accepted definition of what capabilities and features should (and shouldn't) be included.   Each provider approaches XDR with different strengths and perspectives on how what an XDR solution should include.   Therefore, selecting an XDR provider is quite challenging as organizations must organize and prioritize a wide range of capabilities that can differ significantly between providers.   Cynet is now addressing this need with the Definitive RFP Template for XDR solutions ( download here ),

Wazuh Offers XDR Functionality at a Price Enterprises Will Love — Free!<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/wazuh-offers-xdr-functionality-at-price.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Back in 2018, Palo Alto Networks CTO and co-founder Nir Zuk coined a new term to describe the way that businesses needed to approach cybersecurity in the years to come. That term, of course, was extended detection and response (XDR). It described a unified cybersecurity infrastructure that brought endpoint threat detection, network analysis and visibility (NAV), access management, and more under a single roof to find and neutralize digital threats in real-time.  And Zuk's vision of XDR proved prophetic. In the years since he coined the phrase, platforms leveraging the XDR model have emerged as the de-facto leaders of the business cybersecurity industry. But their scale and complexity put them in a product class that's just out of reach for some enterprises.  Fortunately, the open-source community — as it often does — has filled the XDR void with an affordable product — because it's totally free. It's called&nbsp; Wazuh , and it provides enterprises the tools they need to bu

For the last few years, the cybersecurity threat landscape has gotten progressively more complex and dangerous. The online world is now rife with data thieves, extortionists, and even state actors looking to exploit vulnerabilities in businesses' digital defenses.&nbsp;  And unfortunately — the bad guys have the upper hand at the moment. Part of the reason for that is the fallout from the rapid digitization made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic.  According to research on the subject,&nbsp; more than half of businesses &nbsp;have yet to mitigate the risks created by that digitization. And when you add a persistent shortage of cybersecurity workers to that fact, you have the makings of a scary situation.  But businesses aren't helpless. There are plenty of things they can do to augment their defenses as they look to mitigate cyber risks. And best of all, some of those options won't cost them a thing.

This New Tool Can Retrieve Pixelated Text from Redacted Documents<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/this-new-tool-can-retrieve-pixelated.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The practice of blurring out text using a method called pixelation  may not be as secure as previously thought.  While the most foolproof way of concealing sensitive textual information is to use opaque black bars, other redaction methods like pixelation can achieve the opposite effect, enabling the reversal of pixelized text back into its original form.  Dan Petro, a lead researcher at offensive security firm Bishop Fox, has&nbsp; demonstrated &nbsp;a new open-source tool called&nbsp; Unredacter &nbsp;to reconstruct text from the pixelated images, effectively leaking the very information that was meant to be protected.   The tool is also seen as an improvement over an existing utility named&nbsp; Depix , which works by looking up what permutations of pixels could have resulted in certain pixelated blocks to recover the text.   The threat model works on the underlying hypothesis that given a piece of text containing both redacted and un-redacted information, the attacker uses the information about the font si

A recent survey by IWG (the International Workplace Group) determined that 70% of the world's professionals work remotely at least one day a week, with 53% based outside their workplace at least half of the week.  Taking this into consideration, organizations have started looking for reliable partners that can deliver services and support consistently, for example, to install new hybrid infrastructure solutions while trusting them with the everyday functioning of their IT.  So far, MSPs have been meeting this demand by offering multiple solutions that help employees work remotely without any problems.  What are the main cybersecurity solutions remote workers need?

An accountant and a security expert walk into a bar… SOC2 is no joke.&nbsp;  Whether you're a publicly held or private company, you are probably considering going through a Service Organization Controls (SOC) audit. For publicly held companies, these reports are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and executed by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). However, customers often ask for SOC2 reports as part of their vendor due diligence process.&nbsp;  Out of the three types of SOC reports, SOC2 is the standard to successfully pass regulatory requirements and signals high security and resilience within the organization — and is based on the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) attestation requirements. The purpose of this report is to evaluate an organization's information systems relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy — over a period of time (roughly six to twelve months).&nbsp;  As part of a SOC2 audit, i

Cynet's Keys to Extend Threat Visibility<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/cynets-keys-to-extend-threat-visibility.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We hear about the need for better visibility in the cybersecurity space – detecting threats earlier and more accurately. We often hear about the dwell time and the time to identify and contain a data breach. Many of us are familiar with IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report that has been tracking this statistic for years. In the 2021 report, IBM found that, on average, it takes an average of 212 days to identify a breach and then another 75 days to contain the breach, for a total of 287 days.  A new&nbsp; solution overview document &nbsp;provides insights on how XDR provider Cynet tackles the difficult problem of greatly improving threat visibility. Cynet takes a modern approach that includes a greater level of native technology integration and advanced automation purposely designed for organizations with smaller security teams than Fortune 500 organizations.

Researchers Use Natural Silk Fibers to Generate Secure Keys for Strong Authentication<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/researchers-use-natural-silk-fibers-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics at South Korea's Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) have utilized natural silk fibers from domesticated silkworms to build an environmentally friendly digital security system that they say is "practically unbreachable."  "The first natural physical unclonable function (PUF) […] takes advantage of the diffraction of light through natural microholes in native silk to create a secure and unique digital key for future security solutions," the researchers said .  Physical unclonable functions or&nbsp; PUFs &nbsp;refer to devices that leverage inherent randomness and microscopic differences in electronics introduced during manufacturing to generate a unique identifier (e.g., cryptographic keys) for a given set of inputs and conditions.   In other words, PUFs are non-algorithmic one-way functions derived from uncopiable elements to create unbreakable identifiers for strong authentication. Over the years, PUFs have been widely used in smartca

2021 was a year peppered by cyberattacks, with numerous data breaches happening. Not only that, but ransomware has also become a prominent player in the hackers' world.  Now, more than ever, it's important for enterprises to step up cybersecurity measures. They can do this through several pieces of technology, such as an open-source security platform like Wazuh .&nbsp;  Wazuh  is a free and open source security platform that unifies XDR and SIEM capabilities, which not only enables companies to detect sophisticated threats, but can also help immensely in preventing data breaches and leaks from happening. As a result, it can save businesses from costly fixes that can ultimately end in their closure.  It is also possible to integrate Wazuh with a number of external services and tools. Some of them are VirusTotal, YARA, Amazon Macie, Slack, and Fortigate Firewall. Consequently, companies can improve their security against hackers from penetrating their networks.  What's great abou

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
I recently hopped on the&nbsp; Lookout podcast &nbsp;to talk about virtual private networks (VPNs) and how they've been extended beyond their original use case of connecting remote laptops to your corporate network. Even in this new world where people are using personal devices and cloud apps, VPN continues to be the go-to solution for remote access and cloud access. After my conversation with Hank Schless, I was inspired to put some additional thoughts about VPN on paper.  When most organizations were forced to shift to remote work last year, they needed a quick-fix solution that would enable their remote employees to access work resources securely. For many, this solution came in the form of VPNs. However, VPNs were not designed for the bring your own device (BYOD) and cloud app use cases.  While VPNs are able to provide remote access, it may come as a surprise that they fall short when it comes to security. This is because VPNs were built for when only a small portion of your workforce w

Google Chrome has announced plans to prohibit public websites from directly accessing endpoints located within private networks as part of an upcoming major security shakeup to prevent intrusions via the browser.  The proposed change is set to be rolled out in two phases consisting of releases Chrome 98 and Chrome 101 scheduled in the coming months via a newly implemented W3C specification called private network access ( PNA ).   "Chrome will start sending a&nbsp; CORS &nbsp;preflight request ahead of any private network request for a subresource, which asks for explicit permission from the target server," Titouan Rigoudy and Eiji Kitamura&nbsp; said . "This preflight request will carry a new header, Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true, and the response to it must carry a corresponding header, Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true."   What this means is that starting with Chrome version 101, any website accessible via the internet will be made to seek explicit permi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity teams have many demands competing for limited resources. Restricted budgets are a problem, and restricted staff resources are also a bottleneck. There is also the need to maintain business continuity at all times. It's a frustrating mix of challenges – with resources behind tasks such as patching rarely sufficient to meet security prerogatives or compliance deadlines.  The multitude of different security-related standards have ever stringent deadlines, and it is often the case that business needs don't necessarily align with those requirements. At the core of what TuxCare does is automated live patching – a way to consistently keep critical services safe from security threats, without the need to expend significant resources in doing so, or the need to live with business disruption.  In this article, we'll outline how&nbsp; TuxCare &nbsp;helps organizations such as yours deal better with security challenges including patching, and the support of end-of-life operating s

It's almost as if the internet's tailor-made to enable scams and fraud.  And that's just what it does. Right now, the world's on track to &nbsp;lose $10.5 trillion every year &nbsp;to cybercrime. That number is so large that it's hard for the average person to grasp. And when most people hear it, they imagine that money's coming mostly from large-scale data breaches and ransomware attacks on large companies.  Although businesses are among the hardest hit each year, they're by no means the only target. Every day, internet users are targeted too.

Today's cyber attackers are constantly looking for ways to exploit vulnerabilities and infiltrate organizations. To keep up with this evolving threat landscape, security teams must be on the lookout for potential risks around the clock. Since most organizations simply cannot afford to have 24x7 security teams, managed detection and response (MDR) services have become a critical aspect of any modern security stack.&nbsp;  Most organizations must find outsourced MDR providers on top of their existing solutions, but that's not always a feasible solution. XDR provider Cynet offers its MDR service ( learn more here ), which the company calls CyOps, as part of its offering. The service is much more than simply a help desk, though.

Extremely Critical Log4J Vulnerability Leaves Much of the Internet at Risk<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/extremely-critical-log4j-vulnerability.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Apache Software Foundation has released fixes to contain an&nbsp; actively &nbsp; exploited &nbsp;zero-day vulnerability affecting the widely-used Apache Log4j Java-based logging library that could be weaponized to execute malicious code and allow a complete takeover of vulnerable systems.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-44228 &nbsp;and by the monikers Log4Shell or LogJam, the issue concerns a case of unauthenticated, remote code execution (RCE) on any application that uses the open-source utility and affects versions Log4j 2.0-beta9 up to 2.14.1. The bug has scored a perfect 10 on 10 in the CVSS rating system, indicative of the severity of the issue.  "An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from&nbsp; LDAP &nbsp;servers when message lookup substitution is enabled," the Apache Foundation&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "From Log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default."   Exploitation can be achieved by a single string of text, which c

Latest Firefox 95 Includes RLBox Sandboxing to Protect Browser from Malicious Code<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/latest-firefox-95-includes-rlbox.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mozilla is beginning to roll out Firefox 95 with a new sandboxing technology called RLBox that prevents untrusted code and other security vulnerabilities from causing "accidental defects as well as supply-chain attacks."  Dubbed " RLBox " and implemented in collaboration with researchers at the University of California San Diego and the University of Texas, the improved protection mechanism is designed to harden the web browser against potential weaknesses in off-the-shelf libraries used to render audio, video, fonts, images, and other content.   To that end, Mozilla is incorporating "fine-grained sandboxing" into five modules, including its&nbsp; Graphite &nbsp;font rendering engine,&nbsp; Hunspell &nbsp;spell checker,&nbsp; Ogg &nbsp;multimedia container format,&nbsp; Expat &nbsp;XML parser, and&nbsp; Woff2 &nbsp;web font compression format.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, on Thursday announced  an expansion of its Facebook Protect security program to include human rights defenders, activists, journalists, and government officials who are more likely to be targeted by bad actors across its social media platforms.  "These people are at the center of critical communities for public debate," said Nathaniel Gleicher, head of security policy at Meta. "They enable democratic elections, hold governments and organizations accountable, and defend human rights around the world. Unfortunately this also means that they are highly targeted by bad actors."   Facebook Protect , currently being launched globally in phases, enables users who enroll for the initiative to adopt stronger account security protections, like two-factor authentication (2FA), and watch out for potential hacking threats. Meta said more than 1.5 million accounts have enabled Facebook Protect to date, of which nearly 950,000 account

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For most organizations today, the logs produced by their security tools and environments provide a mixed bag. On the one hand, they can be a trove of valuable data on security breaches, vulnerabilities, attack patterns, and general security insights.  On the other, organizations don't have the right means to manage the massive scale of logs and data produced to derive any value from it.&nbsp;  Log management can quickly become a sore point, and either be forgotten or improperly managed if done manually.  In turn, this reduces data transparency and leaves organizations more exposed to vulnerabilities that could have been detected. A new centralized log management module (CLM) introduced by XDR provider Cynet ( learn more here ) could help organizations lighten that load and enhance organizations' visibility into their valuable log data.&nbsp;  Instead of manually handling the collection, storage, and parsing of data, organizations can use CLM to enhance their log analysis, better understand thei

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The average cost of a data breach, according to the latest research by IBM, now stands at&nbsp; USD 4.24 million , the highest reported. The leading cause? Compromised credentials, often caused by human error. Although these findings continue to show an upward trend in the wrong direction, the challenge itself is not new. What is new is the unprecedented and accelerated complexity of securing the workplace. CISOs/CIOs are dealing with legacy systems, cloud hosting, on-prem, remote workers, office based, traditional software, and SaaS.  How businesses adapted was laudable, but now that employees spread across locations, offices and homes – with&nbsp; more than half &nbsp;threatening not to return to offices unless hybrid working is implemented – the challenge morphs into securing a nonuniform perimeter.&nbsp;  We know passwords aren't sufficient. Knowledge-based access is usually fortified with other forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA), such as auth apps or FIDO tokens, and in highly sensitive case

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications have gone from novelty to business necessity in a few short years, and its positive impact on organizations is clear. It's safe to say that most industries today run on SaaS applications, which is undoubtedly positive, but it does introduce some critical new challenges to organizations.&nbsp;  As SaaS application use expands, as well as the number of touchpoints they create, the attack surface also becomes significantly larger.  As an answer to this emerging challenge, XDR provider Cynet has added a new SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) tool to its existing platform ( you can learn more here ). Regardless of the size of an organization or its security team, managing the security policy and posture of dozens to hundreds of SaaS applications is a complex task, and one that requires the right tools to expedite and optimize. Using SSPM can centralize many of the management and logistics requirements and offer a more unified way to establish secur

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has announced plans to automatically enroll about 150 million users into its two-factor authentication scheme by the end of the year as part of its ongoing efforts to prevent unauthorized access to accounts and improve security.  In addition, the internet giant said it also intends to require 2 million YouTube creators to switch on the setting, which it calls two-step verification (2SV), to protect their channels from potential takeover attacks.   "2SV is strongest when it combines both 'something you know' (like a password) and 'something you have' (like your phone or a security key)," Google's AbdelKarim Mardini and Guemmy Kim&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post, adding "having a second form of authentication dramatically decreases an attacker's chance of gaining access to an account."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Facebook on Wednesday announced it's open-sourcing&nbsp; Mariana Trench , an Android-focused static analysis platform the company uses to detect and prevent security and privacy bugs in applications created for the mobile operating system at scale.  "[Mariana Trench] is designed to be able to scan large mobile codebases and flag potential issues on&nbsp; pull requests &nbsp;before they make it into production," the Menlo Park-based social tech behemoth said .   In a nutshell, the utility allows developers to frame rules for different data flows to scan the codebase for in order to unearth potential issues — say,&nbsp; intent &nbsp; redirection &nbsp; flaws &nbsp;that could result in the leak of sensitive data or injection vulnerabilities that would allow adversaries to insert arbitrary code — explicitly setting boundaries as to where user-supplied data entering the app is allowed to come from (source) and flow into (sink) such as a database, file, web view, or a log.

How Cynet's Response Automation Helps Organizations Mitigate Cyber Threats<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/how-cynets-response-automation-helps.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
One of the determining factors of how much damage a cyber-attack cause is how fast organizations can respond to it. Time to response is critical for security teams, and it is a major hurdle for leaner teams.  To help improve this metric and enhance organizations' ability to respond to attacks quickly, many endpoint detection and response (EDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) vendors have started including some form of automation in their platforms to reduce the need for manual intervention.  XDR provider Cynet claims that they go beyond existing solutions when it comes to security automation. More than automating individual components, the Cynet 360 platform ( see a live demo here ) offers automation across every phase of incident response – from detection through remediation. The company uses a variety of tools and techniques to keep organizations safe and quickly respond to any emerging threat.

Microsoft on Wednesday announced a new passwordless mechanism that allows users to access their accounts without a password by using Microsoft Authenticator, Windows Hello, a security key, or a verification code sent via SMS or email.

"But, given the vulnerability of passwords, requirements for them have gotten increasingly complex in recent years, including multiple symbols, numbers, case sensitivity, and disallowing previous passwords."   "Passwords are incredibly inconvenient to create, remember, and manage across all the accounts in our lives," Jakkal added.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WhatsApp on Friday&nbsp; announced &nbsp;it will roll out support for end-to-end encrypted chat backups on the cloud for Android and iOS users, paving the way for storing information such as chat messages and photos in Apple iCloud or Google Drive in a cryptographically secure manner.  The feature, which will go live to all of its two billion users in the coming weeks, is expected to only work on the primary devices tied to their accounts, and not companion devices such as desktops or laptops that simply mirror the content of WhatsApp on the phones.  While the Facebook-owned messaging platform flipped the switch on end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for personal messages, calls, video chats, and media between senders and recipients&nbsp; as far back as April 2016 , the content — should a user opt to back up on the cloud to enable the transfer of chat history to a new device — wasn't subjected to the same security protections until now.

The work-from-anywhere economy has opened up the possibility for your human resources team to source the best talent from anywhere. To scale their operations, organizations are leveraging the cloud to accelerate essential HR functions such as recruiting, onboarding, evaluating, and more.  SAP is leading this HR transformation with its human capital management (HCM) solution, SAP SuccessFactors. Delivering HR solutions from the cloud enables employees and administrators to not only automate typical tasks, such as providing a report on employee attrition, but also allows them to complete these tasks from anywhere and on any device.  SuccessFactors makes it easy for employees to access what they need. But the wide range of sensitive employee data within SuccessFactors creates additional security and compliance challenges.

Researchers Propose Machine Learning-based Bluetooth Authentication Scheme<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/researchers-propose-machine-learning.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics has proposed a machine learning approach that uses authentic interactions between devices in Bluetooth networks as a foundation to handle device-to-device authentication reliably.  Called " Verification of Interaction Authenticity " (aka VIA), the recurring authentication scheme aims to solve the problem of passive, continuous authentication and automatic deauthentication once two devices are paired with one another, which remain authenticated until an explicit deauthentication action is taken, or the authenticated session expires.  "Consider devices that pair via Bluetooth, which commonly follow the pattern of pair once, trust indefinitely. After two devices connect, those devices are bonded until a user explicitly removes the bond. This bond is likely to remain intact as long as the devices exist, or until they transfer ownership," Travis Peters, one of the co-authors of the study,&nbsp; said .

How Does MTA-STS Improve Your Email Security?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/how-does-mta-sts-improve-your-email.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP has easily exploitable security loopholes. Email routing protocols were designed in a time when cryptographic technology was at a nascent stage (e.g., the de-facto protocol for email transfer, SMTP, is nearly 40 years old now), and therefore security was not an important consideration.&nbsp;  As a result, in most email systems encryption is still opportunistic, which implies that if the opposite connection does not support TLS, it gets rolled back to an unencrypted one delivering messages in plaintext.&nbsp;  To mitigate SMTP security problems,&nbsp; MTA-STS &nbsp;(Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security) is the recommended email authentication standard. It enforces TLS in order to allow MTAs to send emails securely. This means that it will only allow mail from MTAs that support TLS encryption, and it will only allow mail to go to MX hosts that support TLS encryption.  In case an encrypted connection cannot be negotiated between communicating SMTP servers, the

Forget watercooler conspiracies or boardroom battles. There's a new war in the office. As companies nudge their staff to return to communal workspaces, many workers don't actually want to – more than 50 percent of employees would rather quit, according to&nbsp; research by EY .&nbsp;  While HR teams worry over the hearts and minds of staff, IT security professionals have a different battle plan to draft – how to make the new normal of the hybrid workplace secure.  The Trade-off Between Usability and Security  A company's biggest vulnerability continues to be its people. In a hybrid workplace, a Zero Trust strategy means ever-tightening security.&nbsp; The MFA a company chooses &nbsp;affects the difficulty of logging into email, dashboards, workflow tools, client documentation, and so on. Or, conversely, how porous access security is.&nbsp;  Now imagine this scenario. An employee opens a company portal, confirms a prompt on a company app on her phone, and that's it. She has been authenticated s

I'm sure you would agree that, in today's digital world, the majority of applications we work on require some type of credentials – to connect to a database with a username/password, to access computer programs via authorized tokens, or API keys to invoke services for authentication.  Credentials, or sometimes just referred to as 'Secrets,' are pieces of user or system-level confidential information that ought to be carefully protected and accessible to legitimate users only. We all know how important it is to keep these assets secure to prevent account misuse and breaches.&nbsp;  A reality check: How often do you make proactive efforts to protect these assets? Rarely, I'd say.&nbsp;  Among the worst mistakes a developer can make when it comes to application security is to accidentally commit confidential information publicly on the Internet. Surprisingly, secrets and credentials are accidentally leaked more often than you might expect, and there are intelligent tools that s

Facebook on Friday said it's extending end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for voice and video calls in Messenger, along with testing a new opt-in setting that will turn on end-to-end encryption for Instagram DMs.  "The content of your messages and calls in an end-to-end encrypted conversation is protected from the moment it leaves your device to the moment it reaches the receiver's device," Messenger's Ruth Kricheli&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post. "This means that nobody else, including Facebook, can see or listen to what's sent or said. Keep in mind, you can report an end-to-end encrypted message to us if something's wrong."  The social media behemoth said E2EE is becoming the industry standard for improved privacy and security.   It's worth noting that the company's flagship messaging service gained support for E2EE in text chats  in 2016, when it added a " secret conversation " option to its app, while communications on its sister platform What

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Zero Trust is increasingly being adopted as the best strategy to maintain application security and prevent data breaches. To help achieve progress on Zero Trust, there is now a new, easy way to implement continuous user verification by connecting directly to the authentication systems used by mobile operators – without the overhead of processing or storing user data.&nbsp;  Before we show you how it works and how to integrate it, let's start with the fundamental challenge.  Zero Trust and Authentication  The Zero Trust model of identity verification essentially means never trusting that a returning user is whom they claim to be, regardless of their location or previous successful attempts. Zero Trust is a strategic approach to access management that is vital for keeping out bad actors.&nbsp;  As the world moves to the cloud, with an increasingly distributed network of employees, partners, and clients, tighter auth journeys become even more important.&nbsp;  But with greater security comes greate

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Online account creation poses a challenge for engineers and system architects: if you put up too many barriers, you risk turning away genuine users. Make it too easy, and you risk fraud or fake accounts.  The Problem with Identity Verification  The traditional model of online identity – username/email and password – has long outlived its usefulness. This is how multi-factor or two-factor authentication (MFA or 2FA) has come into play, to patch up vulnerabilities of the so-called knowledge-based model, usually by SMS passcode to verify possession of a mobile phone number.  The simplicity of SMS-based verification has taken apps by storm – it's the default option, as most users have a mobile phone. Yet bad actors have learned how to exploit this verification method, leading to the menace of&nbsp; SIM swap fraud , which is alarmingly easy to pull off and rising rapidly in incidents.  There's been no lack of effort in finding a more secure factor that is still universal. For example, b

Google on Monday announced&nbsp; new measures &nbsp;for the Play Store, including requiring developer accounts to turn on 2-Step Verification (2SV), provide an address, and verify their contact details later this year.  The new identification and two-factor authentication requirements are a step towards strengthening account security and ensuring a safe and secure app marketplace, Google Play Trust and Safety team said.   As part of the changes, individual users and businesses in possession of Google Play developer accounts will be asked to specify an account type (personal or organization), a contact name, their physical address, as well as verifying the email address and phone number provided during account creation.  In addition, the search giant is also mandating users of Google Play Console to sign in using Google's 2-Step Verification to prevent account takeover attacks.   According to the timeline shared by Google, developer account owners will be able to declare their account type a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As software supply chain attacks emerge as a point of concern in the wake of SolarWinds  and Codecov &nbsp;security incidents, Google is proposing a solution to ensure the integrity of software packages and prevent unauthorized modifications.&nbsp;  Called " Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts " (SLSA, and pronounced "salsa"), the end-to-end framework aims to secure the software development and deployment pipeline — i.e., the source ➞ build ➞ publish workflow — and&nbsp; mitigate threats &nbsp;that arise out of tampering with the source code, the build platform, and the artifact repository at every link in the chain.   Google said SLSA is inspired by the company's own internal enforcement mechanism called Binary Authorization for Borg , a set of auditing tools that verifies code provenance and implements code identity to ascertain that the deployed production software is properly reviewed and authorized.  "In its current state, SLSA is a set of incrementally adoptable

Mozilla Begins Rolling Out 'Site Isolation' Security Feature to Firefox Browser<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/mozilla-begins-rolling-out-site.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mozilla has begun rolling out a new security feature for its Firefox browser in nightly and beta channels that aims to protect users against a new class of side-channel attacks from malicious sites.  Called "Site Isolation," the implementation loads each website separately in its own operating system process and, as a result, prevents untrusted code from a rogue website from accessing confidential information stored in other sites.  "This fundamental redesign of Firefox's Security architecture extends current security mechanisms by creating operating system process-level boundaries for all sites loaded in Firefox for Desktop," Mozilla&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. "Isolating each site into a separate operating system process makes it even harder for malicious sites to read another site's secret or private data."   The motivation for Site Isolation can be traced all the way back to January 2018 when&nbsp; Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities &nbsp;were publicly dis

A Simple 1-Click Compromised Password Reset Feature Coming to Chrome Browser<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/a-simple-1-click-compromised-password.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday&nbsp; announced &nbsp;a new feature to its password manager that could be used to change a stolen password automatically with a single tap.  Automated password changes build on the tool's ability to&nbsp; check the safety &nbsp;of saved passwords. Thus when Chrome finds a password that may have been compromised as part of a data breach, it will prompt users with an alert containing a "Change Password" button, tapping which "Chrome will not only navigate to the site, but also go through the entire process of changing your password."   Enabling this in the background is Google's&nbsp; Duplex &nbsp;technology, which it debuted in 2018 and expanded in 2019 to support various functions in Google Assistant like booking a rental car, ordering food, and buying movie tickets. The search giant, however, noted that users could take over control at any point during the process and change the password manually.   The feature is currently being rolled out in Chrome for Android to al

Apple May Start Delivering Security Patches Separately From Other OS Updates<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/apple-may-start-delivering-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple may be changing the way it delivers security patches to its devices running iOS and iPadOS mobile operating systems.  According to code spotted in iOS 14.5, the iPhone maker is reportedly working on a method for delivering security fixes independently of other OS updates.  The changes were first reported by&nbsp; the 9to5Mac &nbsp;website.   While Google's Android has had monthly security patches rolled out that are completely divorced from the OS-related updates, iOS has no option to install a security update without upgrading to the latest version of the OS.  But with this new setting called "Install Security Updates" added to the software update menu, it's expected that Apple will let users choose between either installing the entire iOS update or just the security updates, in a manner that echoes macOS.  On Macs running older versions of the operating system such as macOS Mojave, Apple has offered standalone update packs, allowing users to get security patches and bu

The attack surface is virtually expanding before our eyes. Protecting assets across multiple locations, with multiple solutions from different vendors, has become a daily concern for CISOs globally.&nbsp;  In a new e-book recently published ( download here ), CISOs with small security teams talk about the drivers for replacing their EDR/NGAV solutions with an Autonomous XDR solution and why they believe consolidation provides significant benefits to organization and team.&nbsp;  The first topic discussed is the need to ensure coverage and have optimal visibility in order to uncover even stealthy threats. Organizations keep adding more and more security solutions that extend visibility, yet these solutions need to be maintained, monitored, and managed, taking up quite a bit of the analyst's time.  In addition, these systems each provide some visibility leaving the analysts to make contextual connections and create the complete attack storyline. Unfortunately, these processes take time, and s

Google uncovers new iOS security feature Apple quietly added after zero-day attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/google-uncovers-new-ios-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google Project Zero on Thursday disclosed details of a new security mechanism that Apple quietly added to iOS 14 as a countermeasure to prevent attacks that were recently found to leverage zero-days in its messaging app.  Dubbed " BlastDoor ," the improved sandbox system for iMessage data was disclosed by Samuel Groß, a security researcher with Project Zero, a team of security researchers at Google tasked with studying zero-day vulnerabilities in hardware and software systems.  "One of the major changes in iOS 14 is the introduction of a new, tightly sandboxed 'BlastDoor' service which is now responsible for almost all parsing of untrusted data in iMessages," Groß&nbsp; said . "Furthermore, this service is written in Swift, a (mostly) memory safe language which makes it significantly harder to introduce classic memory corruption vulnerabilities into the code base."   The development is a consequence of a&nbsp; zero-click exploit &nbsp;that leveraged an Apple iMe

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Creating workflows around verifying password resets can be challenging for organizations, especially since many have shifted work due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.  With the numbers of cyberattacks against businesses exploding and compromised credentials often being the culprit, companies have to bolster security around resetting passwords on user accounts.  How can organizations bolster the security of password resets for remote workers? One security workflow might involve having manager approval before IT helpdesk technicians can change a remote worker's password. In this way, the user's manager is involved in the process.  Additionally, some organizations might opt to allow managers themselves the ability to change end-user passwords. How can this be configured in Active Directory? Also, is there a more seamless solution for requiring manager approval for password resets?  Why password reset security is critical  This past year has undoubtedly created many IT helpdesk st
