The threat actor known as Patchwork likely used romance scam lures to trap victims in Pakistan and India, and infect their Android devices with a remote access trojan called&nbsp; VajraSpy . Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET said it uncovered 12 espionage apps, six of which were available for download from the official Google Play Store and were collectively downloaded more than 1,400 times between April 2021 and March 2023. "VajraSpy has a range of espionage functionalities that can be expanded based on the permissions granted to the app bundled with its code," security researcher Lukáš Štefanko&nbsp; said . "It steals contacts, files, call logs, and SMS messages, but some of its implementations can even extract WhatsApp and Signal messages, record phone calls, and take pictures with the camera." As many as 148 devices in Pakistan and India are estimated to have been compromised in the wild. The malicious apps distributed via Google Play and elsewhere primarily masqueraded

The threat actor behind a peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet known as&nbsp; FritzFrog &nbsp;has made a return with a new variant that leverages the&nbsp; Log4Shell vulnerability &nbsp;to propagate internally within an already compromised network.

It's known to be active since January 2020.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An advanced China-nexus cyber espionage group previously linked to the exploitation of security flaws in VMware and Fortinet appliances has been attributed to the abuse of a critical vulnerability in VMware vCenter Server as a zero-day since late 2021. "UNC3886 has a track record of utilizing zero-day vulnerabilities to complete their mission without being detected, and this latest example further demonstrates their capabilities," Google-owned Mandiant said in a Friday report. The vulnerability in question is CVE-2023-34048 (CVSS score: 9.8), an out-of-bounds write that could be put to use by a malicious actor with network access to vCenter Server to achieve remote code execution. It was fixed by the Broadcom-owned company on October 24, 2023. The virtualization services provider, earlier this week, updated its advisory to acknowledge that "exploitation of CVE-2023-34048 has occurred in the wild." UNC3886 first came to light in September 2022 when it was

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor called Water Curupira has been observed actively distributing the&nbsp; PikaBot &nbsp;loader malware as part of spam campaigns in 2023. "PikaBot's operators ran phishing campaigns, targeting victims via its two components — a loader and a core module — which enabled unauthorized remote access and allowed the execution of arbitrary commands through an established connection with their command-and-control (C&amp;C) server," Trend Micro&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today. The activity began in the first quarter of 2023 that lasted till the end of June, before ramping up again in September. It also overlaps with&nbsp; prior campaigns &nbsp;that have used similar tactics to deliver QakBot, specifically those&nbsp; orchestrated &nbsp;by&nbsp; cybercrime groups &nbsp;known as TA571 and TA577. It's believed that the increase in the number of phishing campaigns related to PikaBot is the result of QakBot's takedown in August, with DarkGate emerging as another replacement. PikaBot is primarily a loader, which means

Threat actors are increasingly making use of GitHub for malicious purposes through novel methods, including abusing secret Gists and issuing malicious commands via git commit messages. "Malware authors occasionally place their samples in services like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and Discord to host second stage malware and sidestep detection tools," ReversingLabs researcher Karlo Zanki&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "But lately, we have observed the increasing use of the GitHub open-source development platform for hosting malware." Legitimate public services are&nbsp; known &nbsp;to be&nbsp; used &nbsp;by&nbsp; threat actors &nbsp;for hosting malware and acting as&nbsp; dead drop resolvers &nbsp;to fetch the actual command-and-control (C2) address. While using public sources for C2 does not make them immune to takedowns, they do offer the benefit of allowing threat actors to easily create attack infrastructure that's both inexpensive and reliable.

Microsoft is warning of an uptick in malicious activity from an emerging threat cluster it's tracking as&nbsp; Storm-0539 &nbsp;for orchestrating gift card fraud and theft via highly sophisticated email and SMS phishing attacks against retail entities during the holiday shopping season. The goal of the attacks is to propagate booby-trapped links that direct victims to adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing pages that are capable of harvesting their credentials and session tokens. "After gaining access to an initial session and token, Storm-0539 registers their own device for subsequent secondary authentication prompts, bypassing MFA protections and persisting in the environment using the fully compromised identity," the tech giant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter).

A threat actor known as&nbsp; Prolific Puma &nbsp;has been maintaining a low profile and operating an underground link shortening service that's offered to other threat actors for at least over the past four years.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A relatively new threat actor known as&nbsp; YoroTrooper &nbsp;is likely made up of operators originating from Kazakhstan. The assessment, which comes from Cisco Talos, is based on their fluency in Kazakh and Russian, use of Tenge to pay for operating infrastructure, and very limited targeting of Kazakhstani entities, barring the government's Anti-Corruption Agency. "YoroTrooper attempts to obfuscate the origin of their operations, employing various tactics to make its malicious activity appear to emanate from Azerbaijan, such as using VPN exit nodes local to that region," security researchers Asheer Malhotra and Vitor Ventura&nbsp; said . First documented by the cybersecurity company in March 2023, the adversary is&nbsp; known to be active &nbsp;since at least June 2022, singling out various state-owned entities in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries.

LUCR-3 overlaps with groups such as Scattered Spider, Oktapus, UNC3944, and STORM-0875 and is a financially motivated attacker that leverages the Identity Provider (IDP) as initial access into an environment with the goal of stealing Intellectual Property (IP) for extortion. LUCR-3 targets Fortune 2000 companies across various sectors, including but not limited to Software, Retail, Hospitality, Manufacturing, and Telecoms. LUCR-3 does not rely heavily on malware or even scripts; instead, LUCR-3 expertly uses victims' own tools, applications, and resources to achieve their goals. At a high level, Initial Access is gained through compromising existing identities in the IDP (Okta: Identity Cloud, Azure AD / Entra, Ping Identity: PingOne). LUCR-3 uses SaaS applications such as document portals, ticketing systems, and chat applications to learn how the victim organization operates and how to access sensitive information.

A Syrian threat actor named&nbsp; EVLF &nbsp;has been outed as the creator of malware families CypherRAT and CraxsRAT. "These RATs are designed to allow an attacker to remotely perform real-time actions and control the victim device's camera, location, and microphone," Cybersecurity firm Cyfirma&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing cyber attack campaign originating from China is targeting the Southeast Asian gambling sector to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons on compromised systems.&nbsp; Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne said the tactics, techniques, and procedures point to the involvement of a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; Bronze Starlight &nbsp;(aka Emperor Dragonfly or Storm-0401), which has been linked to the use of&nbsp; short-lived &nbsp; ransomware families &nbsp;as a smokescreen to conceal its espionage motives. "The threat actors abuse Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Edge, and McAfee VirusScan executables vulnerable to DLL hijacking to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons," security researchers Aleksandar Milenkoski and Tom Hegel&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published today. It also bears noting that the campaign exhibits overlaps with an intrusion set monitored by ESET under the name&nbsp; Operation ChattyGoblin . This activity, in turn, shares commonalities with a&nbsp; supply chain attack &nbsp;that came to light last year leveraging a troja

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The npm package registry has emerged as the target of yet another highly targeted attack campaign that aims to entice developers into downloading malevolent modules. Software supply chain security firm Phylum told The Hacker News the activity exhibits similar behaviors to that of a previous attack wave&nbsp; uncovered in June , which has since been&nbsp; linked to North Korean threat actors . As many as nine packages have been identified as uploaded to npm between August 9 and 12, 2023. This includes: ws-paso-jssdk, pingan-vue-floating, srm-front-util, cloud-room-video, progress-player, ynf-core-loader, ynf-core-renderer, ynf-dx-scripts, and ynf-dx-webpack-plugins. "Due to the sophisticated nature of the attack and the small number of affected packages, we suspect this is another highly targeted attack, likely with a social engineering aspect involved in order to get targets to install these packages," the company&nbsp; said .

Hackers Abusing Cloudflare Tunnels for Covert Communications<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/hackers-abusing-cloudflare-tunnels-for.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has revealed that threat actors are abusing Cloudflare Tunnels to establish covert communication channels from compromised hosts and retain persistent access. "Cloudflared is functionally very similar to ngrok," Nic Finn, a senior threat intelligence analyst at GuidePoint Security, said . "However, Cloudflared differs from ngrok in that it provides a lot more usability for free, including the ability to host TCP connectivity over cloudflared." A command-line tool for Cloudflare Tunnel, cloudflared allows users to create secure connections between an origin web server and Cloudflare's nearest data center so as to hide the web server IP addresses as well as block volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and brute-force login attacks. For a threat actor with elevated access on an infected host, this feature presents a lucrative approach to set up a foothold by generating a token required to establish the tunnel from the victim machine.

A Russia-nexus adversary has been linked to 94 new domains starting March 2023, suggesting that the group is actively modifying its infrastructure in response to public disclosures about its activities. Cybersecurity firm Recorded Future&nbsp;linked the revamped infrastructure to a threat actor it tracks under the name&nbsp; BlueCharlie , a hacking crew that's broadly known by the names Blue Callisto, Callisto (or Calisto), COLDRIVER, Star Blizzard (formerly SEABORGIUM), and TA446. BlueCharlie was previously given the temporary designation Threat Activity Group 53 (TAG-53). "These shifts demonstrate that these threat actors are aware of industry reporting and show a certain level of sophistication in their efforts to obfuscate or modify their activity, aiming to stymie security researchers," the company said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News.

The Russia-linked threat actor known as Gamaredon has been observed conducting data exfiltration activities within an hour of the initial compromise. "As a vector of primary compromise, for the most part, emails and messages in messengers (Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal) are used, in most cases, using previously compromised accounts," the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis of the group published last week. Gamaredon , also called Aqua Blizzard, Armageddon, Shuckworm, or UAC-0010, is a&nbsp; state-sponsored actor &nbsp;with ties to the SBU Main Office in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. The group is estimated to have infected thousands of government computers.

Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a novel rootkit signed by Microsoft that's engineered to communicate with an actor-controlled attack infrastructure. Trend Micro has attributed the activity cluster to the same actor that was previously identified as behind the&nbsp; FiveSys rootkit , which came to light in October 2021. "This malicious actor originates from China and their main victims are the gaming sector in China," Trend Micro's Mahmoud Zohdy, Sherif Magdy, and Mohamed Fahmy&nbsp; said . Their malware seems to have passed through the Windows Hardware Quality Labs ( WHQL ) process for getting a valid signature. Multiple variants of the rootkit spanning eight different clusters have been discovered, with 75 such drivers signed using Microsoft's WHQL program in 2022 and 2023. Trend Micro's analysis of some of the samples has revealed the presence of debug messages in the source code, indicating that the operation is still in the development and testing phas

Charming Kitten, the nation-state actor affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has been attributed to a bespoke spear-phishing campaign that delivers an updated version of a fully-featured PowerShell backdoor called POWERSTAR. "There have been improved operational security measures placed in the malware to make it more difficult to analyze and collect intelligence," Volexity researchers Ankur Saini and Charlie Gardner said in a report published this week. The threat actor is something of an expert when it comes to employing social engineering to lure targets, often crafting tailored fake personas on social media platforms and engaging in sustained conversations to build rapport before sending a malicious link. It's also tracked under the names APT35, Cobalt Illusion, Mint Sandstorm (formerly Phosphorus), and Yellow Garuda.

The Iranian state-sponsored group dubbed MuddyWater has been attributed to a previously unseen command-and-control (C2) framework called&nbsp; PhonyC2 &nbsp;that's been put to use by the actor since 2021.

The Russian threat actor known as&nbsp; Shuckworm &nbsp;has continued its cyber assault spree against Ukrainian entities in a bid to steal sensitive information from compromised environments. Targets of the recent intrusions, which began in February/March 2023, include security services, military, and government organizations, Symantec&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report shared with The Hacker News. "In some cases, the Russian group succeeded in staging long-running intrusions, lasting for as long as three months," the cybersecurity company said. "The attackers repeatedly attempted to access and steal sensitive information such as reports about the deaths of Ukrainian service members, reports from enemy engagements and air strikes, arsenal inventory reports, training reports, and more." Shuckworm, also known by the names Aqua Blizzard (formerly Actinium), Armageddon, Gamaredon, Iron Tilden, Primitive Bear, Trident Ursa, UNC530, and Winterflounder, is attributed to the Russia's Fe

Microsoft on Wednesday took the lid off a "novel and distinct Russian threat actor," which it said is linked to the General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate ( GRU ) and has a "relatively low success rate."

"While the group carries high risk due to their destructive activity, they appear to operate with a lower degree of operational security than that of longstanding and advanced Russian groups such as&nbsp; Seashell Blizzard &nbsp;and&nbsp; Forest Blizzard ."

The Chinese state-sponsored group known as&nbsp; UNC3886 &nbsp;has been found to exploit a zero-day flaw in VMware ESXi hosts to backdoor Windows and Linux systems. The VMware Tools authentication bypass vulnerability, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-20867 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 3.9), "enabled the execution of privileged commands across Windows, Linux, and PhotonOS (vCenter) guest VMs without authentication of guest credentials from a compromised ESXi host and no default logging on guest VMs," Mandiant&nbsp; said . UNC3886 was&nbsp; initially documented &nbsp;by the Google-owned threat intelligence firm in September 2022 as a cyber espionage actor infecting VMware ESXi and vCenter servers with backdoors named VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE. Earlier this March, the group was&nbsp; linked &nbsp;to the exploitation of a now-patched medium-severity security flaw in the Fortinet FortiOS operating system to deploy implants on the network appliances and interact with the aforementioned malware.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Chinese nation-state group known as&nbsp; Camaro Dragon &nbsp;has been linked to yet another backdoor that's designed to meet its intelligence-gathering goals. Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point, which&nbsp; dubbed &nbsp;the Go-based malware TinyNote, said it functions as a first-stage payload capable of "basic machine enumeration and command execution via PowerShell or Goroutines." What the malware lacks in terms of sophistication, it makes up for it when it comes to establishing redundant methods to retain access to the compromised host by means of multiple persistency tasks and varied methods to communicate with different servers. Camaro Dragon overlaps with a threat actor widely tracked as Mustang Panda, a state-sponsored group from China that is known to be active since at least 2012. The adversarial collective was recently in the spotlight for a custom bespoke firmware implant called&nbsp; Horse Shell &nbsp;that co-opts TP-Link routers into a mesh network capable of transmitting co

The Iranian threat actor known as&nbsp; Agrius &nbsp;is leveraging a new ransomware strain called Moneybird in its attacks targeting Israeli organizations. Agrius, also known as Pink Sandstorm (formerly Americium), has a&nbsp; track record &nbsp;of staging destructive data-wiping attacks aimed at Israel under the guise of ransomware infections.

The infamous Lazarus Group actor has been targeting vulnerable versions of Microsoft Internet Information Services ( IIS ) servers as an initial breach route to deploy malware on targeted systems.

"They then execute the normal application to initiate the execution of the malicious DLL." DLL side-loading , similar to DLL search-order hijacking, refers to the proxy execution of a rogue DLL via a benign binary planted in the same directory.

Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed previously undocumented attack infrastructure used by the prolific state-sponsored group&nbsp; SideWinder &nbsp;to strike entities located in Pakistan and China. This comprises a network of 55 domains and IP addresses used by the threat actor, cybersecurity companies Group-IB and Bridewell said in a joint report shared with The Hacker News. "The identified phishing domains mimic various organizations in the news, government, telecommunications, and financial sectors," researchers Nikita Rostovtsev, Joshua Penny, and Yashraj Solanki&nbsp; said . SideWinder has been known to be active since at least 2012, with attack chains primarily leveraging spear-phishing as an intrusion mechanism to obtain a foothold into targeted environments. The target range of the group is widely believed to be associated with Indian espionage interests. The most frequently attacked nations include Pakistan, China, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, the Philippi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Chinese nation-state actor known as&nbsp; Mustang Panda &nbsp;has been linked to a new set of sophisticated and targeted attacks aimed at European foreign affairs entities since January 2023. An analysis of these intrusions, per Check Point researchers Itay Cohen and Radoslaw Madej, has revealed a custom firmware implant designed explicitly for TP-Link routers. "The implant features several malicious components, including a custom backdoor named 'Horse Shell' that enables the attackers to maintain persistent access, build anonymous infrastructure, and enable lateral movement into compromised networks," the company said . "Due to its firmware-agnostic design, the implant's components can be integrated into various firmware by different vendors." The Israeli cybersecurity firm is tracking the threat group under the name Camaro Dragon,&nbsp; which &nbsp;is&nbsp; also known as &nbsp;BASIN, Bronze President, Earth Preta, HoneyMyte, RedDelta, and Red Lich.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Golang implementation of Cobalt Strike called Geacon is likely to garner the attention of threat actors looking to target Apple macOS systems. That's according to findings from SentinelOne, which observed an increase in the number of Geacon payloads appearing on VirusTotal in recent months. "While some of these are likely red-team operations, others bear the characteristics of genuine malicious attacks," security researchers Phil Stokes and Dinesh Devadoss&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. Cobalt Strike &nbsp;is a well-known red teaming and adversary simulation tool developed by Fortra. Owing to its myriad capabilities, illegally cracked versions of the software have been abused by threat actors over the years. While post-exploitation activity associated with Cobalt Strike has primarily singled out Windows, such attacks against macOS are something of a rarity. In May 2022, software supply chain firm Sonatype&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;details of a rogue Python package called " pymafka "

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A gambling company in the Philippines was the target of a China-aligned threat actor as part of a campaign that has been ongoing since October 2021. Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET is tracking the series of attacks against Southeast Asian gambling companies under the name&nbsp; Operation ChattyGoblin . "These attacks use a specific tactic: targeting the victim companies' support agents via chat applications – in particular, the Comm100 and LiveHelp100 apps," ESET&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The use of a trojanized Comm100 installer to deliver malware was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by CrowdStrike in October 2022. The company attributed the supply chain compromise to a threat actor likely with associations to China. The attack chains leverage the aforementioned chat apps to distribute a C# dropper that, in turn, deploys another C# executable, which ultimately serves as a conduit to drop a Cobalt Strike beacon on hacked workstations.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Italian corporate banking clients are the target of an ongoing financial fraud campaign that has been leveraging a new web-inject toolkit called&nbsp; drIBAN &nbsp;since at least 2019. "The main goal of drIBAN fraud operations is to infect Windows workstations inside corporate environments trying to alter legitimate banking transfers performed by the victims by changing the beneficiary and transferring money to an illegitimate bank account," Cleafy researchers Federico Valentini and Alessandro Strino&nbsp; said . The bank accounts, per the Italian cybersecurity firm, are either controlled by the threat actors themselves or their affiliates, who are then tasked with laundering the stolen funds. The use of web injects is a time-tested tactic that makes it possible for malware to inject custom scripts on the client side by means of a man-in-the-browser ( MitB ) attack and intercept traffic to and from the server.

A Chinese state-sponsored hacking outfit has resurfaced with a new campaign targeting government, healthcare, technology, and manufacturing entities based in Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, and Fiji after more than six months of no activity.

A Vietnamese threat actor has been attributed as behind a "malverposting" campaign on social media platforms to infect over 500,000 devices worldwide over the past three months to deliver variants of information stealers such as&nbsp; S1deload Stealer &nbsp;and&nbsp; SYS01stealer . Malverposting refers to the use of promoted social media posts on services like Facebook and Twitter to mass propagate malicious software and other security threats. The idea is to reach a broader audience by paying for ads to "amplify" their posts. According to&nbsp; Guardio Labs , such attacks commence with the adversary creating new business profiles and hijacking already popular accounts to serve ads that claim to offer free adult-rated photo album downloads. Within these ZIP archive files are purported images that are actually executable files, which, when clicked, activate the infection chain and ultimately deploy the stealer malware to siphon session cookies, account data, and other information.

It allows users to insert PHP code pages and posts of WordPress sites that's then executed every time the posts are opened in a web browser. While&nbsp; Eval PHP &nbsp;has never received an update in 11 years, statistics gathered by WordPress show that it's installed on over 8,000 websites, with the number of downloads skyrocketing from one or two on average since September 2022 to 6,988 on March 30, 2023. On April 23, 2023, alone, it was downloaded 2,140 times. The plugin has racked up 23,110 downloads over the past seven days. GoDaddy-owned Sucuri said it observed some infected websites' databases injected with malicious code into the&nbsp; "wp_posts" table , which stores a site's&nbsp; posts,

The Pakistan-based advanced persistent threat (APT) actor known as&nbsp; Transparent Tribe &nbsp;used a two-factor authentication (2FA) tool used by Indian government agencies as a ruse to deliver a new Linux backdoor called Poseidon. "Poseidon is a second-stage payload malware associated with Transparent Tribe," Uptycs security researcher Tejaswini Sandapolla said in a technical report published this week. "It is a general-purpose backdoor that provides attackers with a wide range of capabilities to hijack an infected host. Its functionalities include logging keystrokes, taking screen captures, uploading and downloading files, and remotely administering the system in various ways." Transparent Tribe &nbsp;is also tracked as APT36, Operation C-Major, PROJECTM, and Mythic Leopard, and has a track record of targeting Indian government organizations, military personnel, defense contractors, and educational entities.

U.K. and U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have&nbsp; warned &nbsp;of Russian nation-state actors exploiting now-patched flaws in networking equipment from Cisco to conduct reconnaissance and deploy malware against targets. The&nbsp; intrusions , per the authorities, took place in 2021 and targeted a small number of entities in Europe, U.S. government institutions, and about 250 Ukrainian victims. The activity has been attributed to a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; APT28 , which is also known as Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard (formerly Strontium), FROZENLAKE, and Sofacy, and is affiliated with the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). "APT28 has been known to access vulnerable routers by using default and weak SNMP community strings, and by exploiting CVE-2017-6742," the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said. CVE-2017-6742 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8) is part of a set of remote code execution flaws that stem from a&nbsp; buffer overflow condition &nbsp;in the Simple Network Ma

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Iranian government-backed actor known as&nbsp; Mint Sandstorm &nbsp;has been linked to attacks aimed at critical infrastructure in the U.S. between late 2021 to mid-2022. "This Mint Sandstorm subgroup is technically and operationally mature, capable of developing bespoke tooling and quickly weaponizing N-day vulnerabilities, and has demonstrated agility in its operational focus, which appears to align with Iran's national priorities," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis. Targeted entities consist of seaports, energy companies, transit systems, and a major U.S. utility and gas company. The activity is suspected to be retaliatory and in response to attacks targeting its maritime,&nbsp; railway , and&nbsp; gas station payment systems &nbsp;that took place between May 2020 and late 2021. It's worth noting here that Iran subsequently&nbsp; accused &nbsp;Israel and the U.S. of masterminding the attacks on the gas stations in a bid to create unrest in the nation. Mint Sandsto

The Iranian threat actor known as MuddyWater is continuing its time-tested tradition of relying on legitimate remote administration tools to commandeer targeted systems. While the nation-state group has previously employed&nbsp; ScreenConnect, RemoteUtilities, and Syncro , a&nbsp; new analysis &nbsp;from Group-IB has revealed the adversary's use of the SimpleHelp remote support software in June 2022. MuddyWater, active since at least 2017, is assessed to be a subordinate element within Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). Some of the top targets include Turkey, Pakistan, the U.A.E., Iraq, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the U.S., Azerbaijan, and Afghanistan. "MuddyWater uses SimpleHelp, a legitimate remote device control and management tool, to ensure persistence on victim devices," Nikita Rostovtsev, senior threat analyst at Group-IB, said.

The North Korean threat actor known as the Lazarus Group has been observed shifting its focus and rapidly evolving its tools and tactics as part of a long-running campaign called&nbsp; DeathNote .

The deviation in targeting, along with the use of updated infection vectors, is said to have occurred in April 2020.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor used a malicious self-extracting archive ( SFX ) file in an attempt to establish persistent backdoor access to a victim's environment, new findings from CrowdStrike show. SFX files are capable of extracting the data contained within them without the need for dedicated software to display the file contents. It achieves this by including a decompressor stub, a piece of code that's executed to unpack the archive. "However, SFX archive files can also contain hidden malicious functionality that may not be immediately visible to the file's recipient, and could be missed by technology-based detections alone," CrowdStrike researcher Jai Minton&nbsp; said . In the case investigated by the cybersecurity firm, compromised credentials to a system were used to run a legitimate Windows accessibility application called Utility Manager (utilman.exe) and subsequently launch a password-protected SFX file.

Unknown threat actors are actively exploiting a recently patched security vulnerability in the Elementor Pro website builder plugin for WordPress.

A recent campaign undertaken by&nbsp; Earth Preta &nbsp;indicates that nation-state groups aligned with China are getting increasingly proficient at bypassing security solutions. The&nbsp; threat actor , active since at least 2012, is tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under Bronze President, HoneyMyte, Mustang Panda, RedDelta, and Red Lich. Attack chains mounted by the group commence with a spear-phishing email to deploy a wide range of tools for backdoor access, command-and-control (C2), and data exfiltration. These messages come bearing with malicious lure archives distributed via Dropbox or Google Drive links that employ DLL side-loading, LNK shortcut files, and fake file extensions as arrival vectors to obtain a foothold and drop backdoors like&nbsp; TONEINS, TONESHELL, PUBLOAD , and&nbsp; MQsTTang &nbsp;(aka QMAGENT). Similar infection chains utilizing Google Drive links have been observed&nbsp; delivering Cobalt Strike &nbsp;as early as April 2021. "Earth Preta tends to hide malicious payloads

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
German and South Korean government agencies have warned about cyber attacks mounted by a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; Kimsuky &nbsp;using rogue browser extensions to steal users' Gmail inboxes. The&nbsp; joint advisory &nbsp; comes &nbsp;from Germany's domestic intelligence apparatus, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), and South Korea's National Intelligence Service of the Republic of Korea (NIS). The intrusions are designed to strike "experts on the Korean Peninsula and North Korea issues" through spear-phishing campaigns, the agencies noted. Kimsuky , also known Black Banshee, Thallium, and Velvet Chollima, refers to a&nbsp; subordinate element &nbsp;within North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau and is known to "collect strategic intelligence on geopolitical events and negotiations affecting the DPRK's interests." Primary targets of interest include entities in the U.S. and South Korea, particularly singling out individuals working within

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The zero-day exploitation of a now-patched medium-severity security flaw in the Fortinet&nbsp; FortiOS &nbsp;operating system has been linked to a suspected Chinese hacking group. Threat intelligence firm Mandiant, which made the attribution, said the activity cluster is part of a broader campaign designed to deploy backdoors onto Fortinet and VMware solutions and maintain persistent access to victim environments. The Google-owned threat intelligence and incident response firm is tracking the malicious operation under its uncategorized moniker&nbsp; UNC3886 , a China-nexus threat actor. "UNC3886 is an advanced cyber espionage group with unique capabilities in how they operate on-network as well as the tools they utilize in their campaigns," Mandiant researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical analysis.

The China-aligned Mustang Panda actor has been observed using a hitherto unseen custom backdoor called&nbsp; MQsTTang &nbsp;as part of an ongoing social engineering campaign that commenced in January 2023.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A sophisticated attack campaign dubbed&nbsp; SCARLETEEL &nbsp;is targeting containerized environments to perpetrate theft of proprietary data and software. "The attacker exploited a containerized workload and then leveraged it to perform privilege escalation into an AWS account in order to steal proprietary software and credentials," Sysdig&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. The advanced cloud attack also entailed the deployment of crypto miner software, which the cybersecurity company said is either an attempt to generate illicit profits or a ploy to distract defenders and throw them off the trail. The initial infection vector banked on exploiting a vulnerable public-facing service in a self-managed Kubernetes cluster hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Upon gaining a successful foothold, an XMRig crypto miner was launched and a bash script was used to obtain credentials that could be used to further burrow into the AWS cloud infrastructure and exfiltrate sensitive data.

New Hacking Cluster 'Clasiopa' Targeting Materials Research Organizations in Asia<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/new-hacking-cluster-clasiopa-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Materials research organizations in Asia have been targeted by a previously unknown threat actor using a distinct set of tools. Symantec, by Broadcom Software, is tracking the cluster under the moniker&nbsp; Clasiopa . The origins of the hacking group and its affiliations are currently unknown, but there are hints that suggest the adversary could have ties to India. This includes references to "SAPTARISHI-ATHARVAN-101" in a custom backdoor and the use of the password "iloveindea1998^_^" for a ZIP archive. It's worth noting that&nbsp; Saptarishi , meaning "Seven sages" in Sanskrit, refers to a group of seers who are revered in Hindu literature.&nbsp; Atharvan &nbsp;was an ancient Hindu priest and is believed to have co-authored one of the four&nbsp; Vedas , a collection of religious scriptures in Hinduism. "While these details could suggest that the group is based in India, it is also quite likely that the information was planted as false flags, with the password in

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Shipping companies and medical laboratories in Asia have been the subject of a suspected espionage campaign carried out by a never-before-seen threat actor dubbed Hydrochasma . The activity, which has been ongoing since October 2022, "relies exclusively on publicly available and living-off-the-land tools," Symantec, by Broadcom Software,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. There is no evidence available as yet to determine its origin or affiliation with known threat actors, but the cybersecurity company said the group may be having an interest in industry verticals that are involved in COVID-19-related treatments or vaccines. The standout aspects of the campaign is the absence of data exfiltration and custom malware, with the threat actor employing open source tools for intelligence gathering. By using already available tools, the goal, it appears, is to not only confuse attribution efforts, but also to make the attacks stealthier. The start of the infection

An open source command-and-control (C2) framework known as Havoc is being adopted by threat actors as an alternative to other well-known legitimate toolkits like&nbsp; Cobalt Strike ,&nbsp; Sliver , and&nbsp; Brute Ratel . Cybersecurity firm Zscaler said it observed a new campaign in the beginning of January 2023 targeting an unnamed government organization that utilized&nbsp; Havoc . "While C2 frameworks are prolific, the open-source Havoc framework is an advanced post-exploitation command-and-control framework capable of bypassing the most current and updated version of Windows 11 defender due to the implementation of advanced evasion techniques such as indirect syscalls and sleep obfuscation," researchers Niraj Shivtarkar and Niraj Shivtarkar&nbsp; said . The attack sequence documented by Zscaler begins with a ZIP archive that embeds a decoy document and a screen-saver file that's designed to download and launch the Havoc Demon agent on the infected host.

Telecommunication service providers in the Middle East are being targeted by a previously undocumented threat actor as part of a suspected intelligence gathering mission. Cybersecurity firms SentinelOne and QGroup are tracking the activity cluster under the former's work-in-progress moniker&nbsp; WIP26 . "WIP26 relies heavily on public cloud infrastructure in an attempt to evade detection by making malicious traffic look legitimate," researchers Aleksandar Milenkoski, Collin Farr, and Joey Chen&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. This includes the misuse of Microsoft 365 Mail, Azure, Google Firebase, and Dropbox for malware delivery, data exfiltration, and command-and-control (C2) purposes. The initial intrusion vector used in the attacks entails "precision targeting" of employees via WhatsApp messages that contain links to Dropbox links to supposedly benign archive files.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new financially motivated campaign that commenced in December 2022 has seen the unidentified threat actor behind it deploying a novel ransomware strain dubbed MortalKombat and a clipper malware known as Laplas. Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;it "observed the actor scanning the internet for victim machines with an exposed remote desktop protocol (RDP) port 3389." The attacks, per the cybersecurity company, primarily focuses on individuals, small businesses, and large organizations located in the U.S., and to a lesser extent in the U.K., Turkey, and the Philippines. The starting point that kicks off the multi-stage attack chain is a phishing email bearing a malicious ZIP file that's used as a pathway to deliver either the clipper or the ransomware. In addition to using cryptocurrency-themed email lures impersonating CoinPayments, the threat actor is also known to erase infection markers in an attempt to cover its tracks. MortalKombat, first detected in January 2023, is capable

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor created malicious game modes for the Dota 2 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game that could have been exploited to establish backdoor access to players' systems. The modes exploited a&nbsp; high-severity flaw &nbsp;in the V8 JavaScript engine tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-38003 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), which was&nbsp; exploited as a zero-day &nbsp;and addressed by Google in October 2021. "Since V8 was not sandboxed in Dota, the exploit on its own allowed for remote code execution against other Dota players," Avast researcher Jan Vojtěšek&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. Following responsible disclosure to Valve, the game publisher&nbsp; shipped fixes &nbsp;on January 12, 2023, by upgrading the version of V8. Game modes are essentially&nbsp; custom capabilities &nbsp;that can either augment an existing title or offer completely new gameplay in a manner that deviates from the standard rules.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Suspected Russian threat actors have been targeting Eastern European users in the crypto industry with fake job opportunities as bait to install information-stealing malware on compromised hosts. The attackers "use several highly obfuscated and under-development custom loaders in order to infect those involved in the cryptocurrency industry with Enigma stealer," Trend Micro researchers Aliakbar Zahravi and Peter Girnus&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report this week. Enigma is said to be an altered version of Stealerium, an open source C#-based malware that acts as a stealer, clipper, and keylogger. The intricate infection journey starts with a rogue RAR archive file that's distributed via phishing or social media platforms. It contains two documents, one of which is a .TXT file that includes a set of sample interview questions related to cryptocurrency. The second file is a Microsoft Word document that, while serving as a decoy, is tasked with launching the first-stage Enigma loader,

A new intelligence gathering campaign linked to the prolific North Korean state-sponsored Lazarus Group leveraged known security flaws in unpatched Zimbra devices to compromise victim systems. That's according to Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure (formerly F-Secure), which codenamed the incident No Pineapple in reference to an error message that's used in one of the backdoors. Targets of the malicious operation included a healthcare research organization in India, the chemical engineering department of a leading research university, as well as a manufacturer of technology used in the energy, research, defense, and healthcare sectors, suggesting an attempt to breach the supply chain. Roughly 100GB of data is estimated to have been exported by the hacking crew following the compromise of an unnamed customer, with the digital break-in likely taking place in the third quarter of 2022.

Microsoft on Tuesday said it took steps to disable fake Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) accounts that were used for creating malicious&nbsp; OAuth &nbsp;applications as part of a malicious campaign designed to breach organizations' cloud environments and steal email.

Researchers Uncover Connection b/w Moses Staff and Emerging Abraham's Ax Hacktivists Group<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/researchers-uncover-connection-bw-moses.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has linked the operations of a politically motivated hacktivist group known as Moses Staff to another nascent threat actor named&nbsp; Abraham's Ax &nbsp;that emerged in November 2022. This is based on "several commonalities across the iconography, videography, and leak sites used by the groups, suggesting they are likely operated by the same entity," Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. Moses Staff, tracked by the cybersecurity firm under the moniker&nbsp; Cobalt Sapling , made its&nbsp; first appearance &nbsp;on the threat landscape in September 2021 with the goal of primarily targeting Israeli organizations. The geopolitical group is believed to be&nbsp; sponsored &nbsp;by the Iranian government and has since been linked to a string of espionage and sabotage attacks that make use of tools like&nbsp; StrifeWater RAT &nbsp;and open source utilities such as&nbsp; DiskCryptor &nbsp;to harvest sensitive information and lock victim data on infected hosts.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A North Korean nation-state group notorious for crypto heists has been attributed to a new wave of malicious email attacks as part of a "sprawling" credential harvesting activity targeting a number of industry verticals, marking a significant shift in its strategy. The state-aligned threat actor is being tracked by Proofpoint under the name&nbsp; TA444 , and by the larger cybersecurity community as APT38,&nbsp; BlueNoroff , Copernicium, and Stardust Chollima. TA444 is "utilizing a wider variety of delivery methods and payloads alongside blockchain-related lures, fake job opportunities at prestigious firms, and salary adjustments to ensnare victims," the enterprise security firm&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The advanced persistent threat is something of an aberration among state-sponsored groups in that its operations are financially motivated and geared towards generating illicit revenue for the Hermit Kingdom.

Chinese Hackers Utilize Golang Malware in DragonSpark Attacks to Evade Detection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/chinese-hackers-utilize-golang-malware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Organizations in East Asia are being targeted by a likely Chinese-speaking actor dubbed DragonSpark while employing uncommon tactics to go past security layers. "The attacks are characterized by the use of the little known open source SparkRAT and malware that attempts to evade detection through Golang source code interpretation," SentinelOne&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published today. A striking aspect of the intrusions is the consistent use of SparkRAT to conduct a variety of activities, including stealing information, obtaining control of an infected host, or running additional PowerShell instructions. The threat actor's end goals remain unknown as yet, although espionage or cybercrime is likely to be the motive. DragonSpark's ties to China stem from the use of the&nbsp; China Chopper &nbsp;web shell to deploy malware – a widely used attack pathway among Chinese threat actors. Furthermore, not only do the open source tools used in the cyber assaults originate from develope

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The legitimate command-and-control (C2) framework known as Sliver is&nbsp; gaining &nbsp; more traction &nbsp;from threat actors as it emerges as an open source alternative to&nbsp; Cobalt Strike &nbsp;and Metasploit. The findings come from Cybereason, which&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;its inner workings in an exhaustive analysis last week. Sliver, developed by cybersecurity company BishopFox, is a Golang-based cross-platform post-exploitation framework that's designed to be used by security professionals in their red team operations. Its myriad features for adversary simulation – including dynamic code generation, in-memory payload execution, and process injection – have also made it an appealing tool for threat actors looking to gain elevated access to the target system upon gaining an initial foothold. In other words, the software is used as a second-stage to conduct next steps of the attack chain after already compromising a machine using one of the initial intrusion vectors such as spear-phishing or exploitatio

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging malicious LNK files as an initial access method to download and execute payloads such as Bumblebee, IcedID, and Qakbot. A recent study by cybersecurity experts has shown that it is possible to identify relationships between different threat actors by analyzing the metadata of malicious LNK files, uncovering information such as the specific tools and techniques used by different groups of cybercriminals, as well as potential links between seemingly unrelated attacks. "With the increasing usage of LNK files in attack chains, it's logical that threat actors have started developing and using tools to create such files," Cisco Talos researcher Guilherme Venere said in a report shared with The Hacker News. This comprises tools like&nbsp; NativeOne 's&nbsp; mLNK Builder &nbsp;and&nbsp; Quantum Builder , which allow subscribers to generate rogue shortcut files and evade security solutions.

New research has found that it is possible for threat actors to abuse a legitimate feature in GitHub Codespaces to deliver malware to victim systems. GitHub Codespaces &nbsp;is a cloud-based configurable development environment that allows users to debug, maintain, and commit changes to a given codebase from a web browser or via an integration in Visual Studio Code. It also comes with a port forwarding feature that makes it possible to access a web application that's running on a particular port within the codespace directly from the browser on a local machine for testing and debugging purposes. "You can also forward a port manually, label forwarded ports, share forwarded ports with members of your organization, share forwarded ports publicly, and add forwarded ports to the codespace configuration," GitHub&nbsp; explains &nbsp;in its documentation. It's&nbsp; important &nbsp;to note here that any forwarded port that's made public will also permit any party with knowledge of the URL

The advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as&nbsp; StrongPity &nbsp;has targeted Android users with a trojanized version of the Telegram app through a fake website that impersonates a video chat service called Shagle .

"The app is a modified version of the open source Telegram app, repackaged with StrongPity backdoor code." StrongPity , also known by the names APT-C-41 and Promethium, is a cyberespionage group active since at least 2012, with a majority of its operations focused on Syria and Turkey. The existence of the group was first publicly reported by Kaspersky in October 2016.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Platform certificates used by Android smartphone vendors like Samsung, LG, and MediaTek have been found to be abused to sign malicious apps.  The findings were first&nbsp; discovered and reported &nbsp;by Google reverse engineer Łukasz Siewierski on Thursday.  "A platform certificate is the application signing certificate used to sign the 'android' application on the system image," a report filed through the Android Partner Vulnerability Initiative ( AVPI )&nbsp; reads .  "The 'android' application runs with a highly privileged user id – android.uid.system – and holds system permissions, including permissions to access user data."   This effectively means that a rogue application signed with the same certificate can gain the highest level of privileges as the Android operating system, permitting it to harvest all kinds of sensitive information from a compromised device.  The list of malicious Android app packages that have abused the certificates is below -   com.

Hackers Exploiting Redis Vulnerability to Deploy New Redigo Malware on Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/12/hackers-exploiting-redis-vulnerability.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Go-based malware is targeting Redis servers with the goal of taking control of the infected systems and likely building a botnet network.  The attacks involve taking advantage of a critical security vulnerability in the open source, in-memory, key-value store that was disclosed earlier this year to deploy&nbsp; Redigo , according to cloud security firm&nbsp; Aqua .   Tracked as CVE-2022-0543 (CVSS score: 10.0), the weakness pertains to a case of sandbox escape in the Lua scripting engine that could be leveraged to attain remote code execution.   This is not the first time the flaw has come under active exploitation, what with Juniper Threat Labs uncovering attacks perpetrated by the&nbsp; Muhstik botnet &nbsp;in March 2022 to execute arbitrary commands.  The Redigo infection chain is similar in that the adversaries scan for exposed Redis servers on port 6379 to establish initial access, following it up by downloading a shared library "exp_lin.so" from a remote server.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korea-linked&nbsp; ScarCruft &nbsp;group has been attributed to a previously undocumented backdoor called Dolphin  that the threat actor has used against targets located in its southern counterpart.  "The backdoor [...] has a wide range of spying capabilities, including monitoring drives and portable devices and exfiltrating files of interest, keylogging and taking screenshots, and stealing credentials from browsers," ESET researcher Filip Jurčacko&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today.  Dolphin is said to be selectively deployed, with the malware using cloud services like Google Drive for data exfiltration as well as command-and-control.   The Slovak cybersecurity company said it found the implant deployed as a final-stage payload as part of a watering hole attack in early 2021 directed against a South Korean digital newspaper.  The campaign, first uncovered by&nbsp; Kaspersky &nbsp;and&nbsp; Volexity &nbsp;last year,&nbsp; entailed &nbsp;the weaponization of two Internet Explorer flaws ( CVE-2020-1380

Chinese Cyber Espionage Hackers Using USB Devices to Target Entities in Philippines<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/chinese-cyber-espionage-hackers-using.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor with a suspected China nexus has been linked to a set of espionage attacks in the Philippines that primarily relies on USB devices as an initial infection vector.  Mandiant, which is part of Google Cloud, is tracking the cluster under its uncategorized moniker&nbsp; UNC4191 . An analysis of the artifacts used in the intrusions indicates that the campaign dates as far back as September 2021.  "UNC4191 operations have affected a range of public and private sector entities primarily in Southeast Asia and extending to the U.S., Europe, and APJ," researchers Ryan Tomcik, John Wolfram, Tommy Dacanay, and Geoff Ackerman&nbsp; said .   "However, even when targeted organizations were based in other locations, the specific systems targeted by UNC4191 were also found to be physically located in the Philippines."  The reliance on infected USB drives to propagate the malware is unusual if&nbsp; not new . The&nbsp; Raspberry Robin &nbsp;worm, which has&nbsp; evolved &nbsp;into an initial access ser

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are capitalizing on a popular TikTok challenge to trick users into downloading information-stealing malware, according to new research from Checkmarx.  The trend, called&nbsp; Invisible Challenge , involves applying a filter known as&nbsp; Invisible Body &nbsp;that just leaves behind a silhouette of the person's body.  But the fact that individuals filming such videos could be undressed has led to a nefarious scheme wherein the attackers post TikTok videos with links to rogue software dubbed "unfilter" that purport to remove the applied filters.   "Instructions to get the 'unfilter' software deploy&nbsp; WASP stealer malware &nbsp;hiding inside malicious Python packages," Checkmarx researcher Guy Nachshon&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday analysis.  The WASP stealer (aka W4SP Stealer) is a malware that's designed to steal users' passwords, Discord accounts, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive information.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The cyber espionage group known as Bahamut  has been attributed as behind a highly targeted campaign that infects users of Android devices with malicious apps designed to extract sensitive information.  The activity, which has been active since January 2022, entails distributing rogue VPN apps through a fake SecureVPN website set up for this purpose, Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report shared with The Hacker News.  At least eight different variants of the spyware apps have been discovered to date, with them being trojanized versions of legitimate VPN apps like&nbsp; SoftVPN &nbsp;and&nbsp; OpenVPN .   The tampered apps and their updates are pushed to users through the fraudulent website. It's also suspected that the targets are carefully selected, since launching the app requires the victim to enter an activation key to enable the features.  This implies the use of an undetermined distribution vector, although past evidence shows that it could take the form of spear-phishing em

Microsoft on Tuesday disclosed the intrusion activity aimed at Indian power grid entities earlier this year likely involved the exploitation of security flaws in a now-discontinued web server called Boa .

The cybersecurity firm attributed the attacks to a previously undocumented threat cluster called Threat Activity Group 38. While the Indian government described the attacks as unsuccessful "probing attempts," China denied it was behind the campaign.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A notorious advanced persistent threat actor known as&nbsp; Mustang Panda &nbsp;has been linked to a spate of spear-phishing attacks targeting government, education, and research sectors across the world.  The primary targets of the intrusions from May to October 2022 included counties in the Asia Pacific region such as Myanmar, Australia, the Philippines, Japan, and Taiwan, cybersecurity firm Trend Micro&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Friday report.&nbsp;  Mustang Panda, also called Bronze President, Earth Preta, HoneyMyte, and Red Lich, is a China-based espionage actor believed to be active since at least July 2018. The group is known for its use of malware such as China Chopper and PlugX to collect data from compromised environments.   Activities of the group chronicled by&nbsp; ESET ,&nbsp; Google, Proofpoint ,&nbsp; Cisco Talos , and&nbsp; Secureworks &nbsp;this year have revealed the threat actor's pattern of using PlugX (and its variant called Hodur) to infect a wide range of entities in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Ameri

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Hackers tied to the North Korean government have been observed using an updated version of a backdoor known as Dtrack targeting a wide range of industries in Germany, Brazil, India, Italy, Mexico, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the U.S.  "Dtrack allows criminals to upload, download, start or delete files on the victim host," Kaspersky researchers Konstantin Zykov and Jornt van der Wiel&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.  The victimology patterns indicate an expansion to Europe and Latin America. Sectors targeted by the malware are education, chemical manufacturing, governmental research centers and policy institutes, IT service providers, utility providers, and telecommunication firms.   Dtrack, also called Valefor and Preft, is the handiwork of Andariel, a subgroup of the&nbsp; Lazarus nation-state threat actor &nbsp;that's publicly tracked by the broader cybersecurity community using the monikers Operation Troy, Silent Chollima, and Stonefly.  Discovered in September 2019, the malware

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recently discovered cyber espionage group dubbed&nbsp; Worok &nbsp;has been found hiding malware in seemingly innocuous image files, corroborating a crucial link in the threat actor's infection chain.  Czech cybersecurity firm Avast said the purpose of the PNG files is to conceal a payload that's used to facilitate information theft.  "What is noteworthy is data collection from victims' machines using Dropbox repository, as well as attackers using Dropbox API for communication with the final stage," the company&nbsp; said .  The development comes a little over two months after ESET disclosed details of attacks carried out by&nbsp; Worok &nbsp;against high-profile companies and local governments located in Asia and Africa. Worok is believed to share tactical overlaps with a Chinese threat actor tracked as&nbsp; TA428 .   The Slovak cybersecurity company also documented Worok's compromise sequence, which makes use of a C++-based loader called CLRLoad  to pave the way for an unknown PowerS

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new analysis of tools put to use by the Black Basta ransomware operation has identified ties between the threat actor and the&nbsp; FIN7 &nbsp;(aka Carbanak) group.  This link "could suggest either that Black Basta and FIN7 maintain a special relationship or that one or more individuals belong to both groups," cybersecurity firm SentinelOne&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up shared with The Hacker News.  Black Basta, which&nbsp; emerged &nbsp;earlier this year, has been attributed to a ransomware spree that has claimed over 90 organizations as of September 2022, suggesting that the adversary is both well-organized and well-resourced.  One notable aspect that makes the group stand out, per SentinelOne, is the fact that there have been no signs of its operators attempting to recruit affiliates or advertising the malware as a RaaS on darknet forums or crimeware marketplaces.  This has raised the possibility that the Black Basta developers either cut out affiliates from the chain and deploy the ranso

The North Korean espionage-focused actor known as Kimsuky has been observed using three different Android malware strains to target users located in its southern counterpart.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor behind a remote access trojan called RomCom RAT has been observed targeting Ukrainian military institutions as part of a new spear-phishing campaign that commenced on October 21, 2022.&nbsp;  The development marks a shift in the attacker's modus operandi, which has been previously attributed to spoofing legitimate apps like Advanced IP Scanner and pdfFiller to drop backdoors on compromised systems.  "The initial 'Advanced IP Scanner' campaign occurred on July 23, 2022," the BlackBerry research and intelligence team&nbsp; said . "Once the victim installs a Trojanized bundle, it drops RomCom RAT to the system."   While previous iterations of the campaign involved the use of trojanized Advanced IP Scanner, the unidentified adversarial collective has since switched to pdfFiller as of October 20, indicating an active attempt on part of the adversary to refine tactics and thwart detection.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A cybercrime group known as&nbsp; Vice Society &nbsp;has been linked to multiple ransomware strains in its malicious campaigns aimed at the education, government, and retail sectors.  The Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence team, which is tracking the threat cluster under the moniker DEV-0832, said the group avoids deploying ransomware in some cases and rather likely carries out extortion using exfiltrated stolen data.  "Shifting ransomware payloads over time from&nbsp; BlackCat ,&nbsp; Quantum Locker , and&nbsp; Zeppelin , DEV-0832's latest payload is a Zeppelin variant that includes Vice Society-specific file extensions, such as .v-s0ciety, .v-society, and, most recently, .locked," the tech giant's cybersecurity division&nbsp; said .   Vice Society, active since June 2021, has been steadily observed encrypting and exfiltrating victim data, and threatening companies with exposure of siphoned information to pressure them into paying a ransom.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind the&nbsp; Black Basta &nbsp; ransomware family &nbsp;have been observed using the Qakbot trojan to deploy the Brute Ratel C4 framework as a second-stage payload in recent attacks.  The development marks the first time the&nbsp; nascent adversary simulation software &nbsp;is being delivered via a Qakbot infection, cybersecurity firm Trend Micro&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical analysis released last week.  The intrusion, achieved using a phishing email containing a weaponized link pointing to a ZIP archive, further entailed the use of Cobalt Strike for lateral movement.  While these legitimate utilities are designed for conducting penetration testing activities, their ability to offer remote access has made them a lucrative tool in the hands of attackers looking to stealthily probe the compromised environment without attracting attention for extended periods of time.  This has been compounded by the fact that a&nbsp; cracked version &nbsp;of Brute Ratel C4 began circulating last month across the cybercrimi

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Telecommunications and IT service providers in the Middle East and Asia are being targeted by a previously undocumented Chinese-speaking threat group dubbed WIP19 .  The espionage-related attacks are characterized by the use of a stolen digital certificate issued by a Korean company called DEEPSoft  to sign malicious artifacts deployed during the infection chain to evade detection.  "Almost all operations performed by the threat actor were completed in a 'hands-on keyboard' fashion, during an interactive session with compromised machines," SentinelOne researchers Joey Chen and Amitai Ben Shushan Ehrlich&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report this week.   "This meant the attacker gave up on a stable [command-and-control] channel in exchange for stealth."  WIP, short for work-in-progress, is the moniker assigned by SentinelOne to emerging or hitherto unattributed activity clusters,&nbsp; similar &nbsp;to the UNC####, DEV-####, and TAG-## designations given by Mandiant, Microsoft, and Reco

An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor known as&nbsp; Budworm &nbsp;targeted a U.S.-based entity for the first time in more than six years, according to latest research.

A Brazilian threat actor known as&nbsp; Prilex &nbsp;has resurfaced after a year-long operational hiatus with an advanced and complex malware to steal money by means of fraudulent transactions.  "The Prilex group has shown a high level of knowledge about credit and debit card transactions, and how software used for payment processing works," Kaspersky researchers&nbsp; said . "This enables the attackers to keep updating their tools in order to find a way to circumvent the authorization policies, allowing them to perform their attacks."  The cybercrime group emerged on the scene with ATM-focused malware attacks in the South American nation, providing it the ability to break into ATM machines to perform jackpotting – a type of attack aiming to dispense cash illegitimately – and clone thousands of credit cards to steal funds from the targeted bank's customers.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Several hacktivist groups are using Telegram and other tools to aid anti-government protests in Iran to bypass regime censorship restrictions amid&nbsp; ongoing unrest &nbsp;in the country following the death of Mahsa Amini in custody.  "Key activities are data leaking and selling, including officials' phone numbers and emails, and maps of sensitive locations," Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.   The company said it has also witnessed sharing of proxies and open VPN servers to get around censorship and reports on the internet status in the country, with one group helping the anti-government demonstrators access social media sites.  Chief among them is a Telegram channel called Official Atlas Intelligence Group (AIG) that's primarily focused on publishing data associated with government officials as well as maps of prominent locations.   Calling itself the "CyberArmy," the group is said to have commenced its operations in May and has also

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Russian state-sponsored threat actor known as&nbsp; APT28 &nbsp;has been found leveraging a new code execution method that makes use of mouse movement in decoy Microsoft PowerPoint documents to deploy malware.  The technique "is designed to be triggered when the user starts the presentation mode and moves the mouse," cybersecurity firm Cluster25&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. "The code execution runs a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a dropper from OneDrive."   The dropper, a seemingly harmless image file, functions as a pathway for a follow-on payload, a variant of a malware known as Graphite, which uses the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive for command-and-control (C2) communications to retrieve additional payloads.  The attack employs a lure document that makes use of a template potentially linked to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ), a Paris-based intergovernmental entity.

The infamous Lazarus Group has continued its pattern of leveraging unsolicited job opportunities to deploy malware targeting Apple's macOS operating system.  In the latest variant of the campaign observed by cybersecurity company SentinelOne last week, decoy documents advertising positions for the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange firm Crypto[.]com have been used to mount the attacks.  The latest disclosure builds on previous findings from Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET in August, which&nbsp; delved &nbsp;into a similar phony job posting for the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange platform.   Both these fake job advertisements are just the latest in a series of attacks dubbed&nbsp; Operation In(ter)ception , which, in turn, is a constituent of a broader campaign tracked under the name&nbsp; Operation Dream Job .

At least three alleged hacktivist groups working in support of Russian interests are likely doing so in collaboration with state-sponsored cyber threat actors, according to Mandiant.  The Google-owned threat intelligence and incident response firm&nbsp; said &nbsp;with moderate confidence that "moderators of the purported hacktivist Telegram channels 'XakNet Team,' 'Infoccentr,' and 'CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn' are coordinating their operations with Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)-sponsored cyber threat actors."  Mandiant's assessment is based on evidence that the leakage of data stolen from Ukrainian organizations occurred within 24 hours of&nbsp; malicious wiper incidents &nbsp;undertaken by the Russian nation-state group tracked as&nbsp; APT28 &nbsp;(aka Fancy Bear, Sofacy, or Strontium).   To that end, four of the 16 data leaks from these groups coincided with&nbsp; disk wiping malware attacks &nbsp;by APT28 that involved the use of a strain dubbed&nbsp; CaddyWiper .  APT28 , a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A China-aligned advanced persistent threat actor known as TA413 weaponized recently disclosed flaws in Sophos Firewall and Microsoft Office to deploy a never-before-seen backdoor called LOWZERO as part of an espionage campaign aimed at Tibetan entities.  Targets primarily consisted of organizations associated with the Tibetan community, including enterprises associated with the Tibetan government-in-exile.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hack-for-hire group that was&nbsp; first exposed in 2019 &nbsp;has expanded its focus to set its sights on entities with business or political ties to Russia.  Dubbed Void Balaur , the cyber mercenary collective has a history of launching cyberattacks against biotechnology and telecom companies since 2015.

"Void Balaur [...] primarily dabbles in cyber espionage and data theft, selling the stolen information to anyone willing to pay," Trend Micro&nbsp; noted &nbsp;at the time.   Attacks conducted by the group are typically both generic and opportunistic and are aimed at gaining unauthorized access to widely-used email services, social media, messaging, and corporate accounts.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-patched critical security flaw affecting Atlassian Confluence Server that came to light a few months ago is being actively exploited for illicit cryptocurrency mining on unpatched installations.  "If left unremedied and successfully exploited, this vulnerability could be used for multiple and more malicious attacks, such as a complete domain takeover of the infrastructure and the deployment information stealers, remote access trojans (RATs), and ransomware," Trend Micro threat researcher Sunil Bharti&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.  The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-26134 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8), was addressed by the Australian software company in June 2022.   In one of the infection chains observed by the cybersecurity company, the flaw was leveraged to download and run a shell script ("ro.sh") on the victim's machine, which, in turn, fetched a second shell script ("ap.sh").

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat with a North Korea nexus has been found leveraging a "novel spear phish methodology" that involves making use of trojanized versions of the PuTTY SSH and Telnet client.  Google-owned threat intelligence firm Mandiant attributed the new campaign to an emerging threat cluster it tracks under the name&nbsp; UNC4034 .  "UNC4034 established communication with the victim over WhatsApp and lured them to download a malicious ISO package regarding a fake job offering that led to the deployment of the AIRDRY.V2 backdoor through a trojanized instance of the PuTTY utility," Mandiant researchers&nbsp; said .   The utilization of fabricated job lures as a pathway for malware distribution is an oft-used tactic by North Korean state-sponsored actors, including the Lazarus Group, as part of an enduring campaign called&nbsp; Operation Dream Job .

A threat actor tracked under the moniker Webworm  has been linked to bespoke Windows-based remote access trojans, some of which are said to be in pre-deployment or testing phases.

It's worth pointing out that all the three backdoors are primarily associated with Chinese threat actors such as Stone Panda (APT10), Aurora Panda (APT17), Emissary Panda (APT27), and Judgement Panda (APT31), among others, although they have been put to use by other hacking groups.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Hackers tied to the Iranian government have been targeting individuals specializing in Middle Eastern affairs, nuclear security, and genome research as part of a new social engineering campaign designed to hunt for sensitive information.  Enterprise security firm Proofpoint attributed the targeted attacks to a threat actor named&nbsp; TA453 , which broadly overlaps with cyber activities monitored under the monikers APT42, Charming Kitten, and Phosphorus.  It all starts with a phishing email impersonating legitimate individuals at Western foreign policy research organizations that's ultimately designed to gather intelligence on behalf of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).  Spoofed personas include people from Pew Research Center, the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FRPI), the U.K.'s Chatham House, and the scientific journal Nature. The technique is said to have been deployed in mid-June 2022.  What's different from other phishing attacks is the use of a tact

A zero-day flaw in a WordPress plugin called&nbsp; BackupBuddy &nbsp;is being actively exploited, WordPress security company Wordfence has disclosed.  "This vulnerability makes it possible for unauthenticated users to download arbitrary files from the affected site which can include sensitive information," it&nbsp; said .  BackupBuddy allows users to back up their entire WordPress installation from within the dashboard, including theme files, pages, posts, widgets, users, and media files, among others.   The plugin is estimated to have around 140,000 active installations, with the flaw (CVE-2022-31474, CVSS score: 7.5) affecting versions 8.5.8.0 to 8.7.4.1. It's been addressed in version 8.7.5 released on September 2, 2022.  The issue is rooted in the function called "Local Directory Copy" that's designed to store a local copy of the backups. According to Wordfence, the vulnerability is the result of the insecure implementation, which enables an unauthenticated threat act

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious campaign mounted by the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group &nbsp;targeted energy providers around the world, including those based in the United States, Canada, and Japan, between February and July 2022.  "The campaign is meant to infiltrate organizations around the world for establishing long-term access and subsequently exfiltrating data of interest to the adversary's nation-state," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Some elements of the espionage attacks have already entered public domain, courtesy of prior reports from Broadcom-owned&nbsp; Symantec &nbsp;and&nbsp; AhnLab &nbsp;earlier this April and May. Symantec attributed the operation to a group referred to as Stonefly, a Lazarus subgroup which is better known as Andariel, Guardian of Peace, OperationTroy, and Silent Chollima.   While these attacks previously led to the instrumentation of Preft (aka Dtrack) and NukeSped (aka Manuscrypt) implants, the latest attack wave is notable for employing two other pieces of mal

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The prolific North Korean nation-state actor known as the Lazarus Group has been linked to a new remote access trojan called&nbsp; MagicRAT .  The previously unknown piece of malware is said to have been deployed in victim networks that had been initially breached via successful exploitation of internet-facing VMware Horizon servers, Cisco Talos said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "While being a relatively simple RAT capability-wise, it was built with recourse to the&nbsp; Qt Framework , with the sole intent of making human analysis harder, and automated detection through machine learning and heuristics less likely," Talos researchers Jung soo An, Asheer Malhotra, and Vitor Ventura&nbsp; said .   Lazarus Group , also known as APT38, Dark Seoul, Hidden Cobra, and Zinc, refers to a cluster of financial motivated and espionage-driven&nbsp; cyber activities &nbsp;undertaken by the North Korean government as a means to sidestep sanctions imposed on the country and meet its strategic objectives

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
High-profile companies and local governments located primarily in Asia are the subjects of targeted attacks by a previously undocumented espionage group dubbed&nbsp; Worok &nbsp;that has been active since late 2020.  "Worok's toolset includes a C++ loader CLRLoad, a PowerShell backdoor PowHeartBeat, and a C# loader PNGLoad that uses steganography to extract hidden malicious payloads from PNG files," ESET researcher Thibaut Passilly&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today.  Worok is said to share overlaps in tools and interests with another adversarial collective tracked as&nbsp; TA428 , with the group linked to attacks against entities spanning energy, financial, maritime, and telecom sectors in Asia as well as a government agency in the Middle East and a private firm in southern Africa.   Malicious activities undertaken by the group experienced a noticeable break from May 2021 to January 2022, before resuming the next month. The Slovak cybersecurity firm assessed the group's goals

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as three disparate but related campaigns between March and Jun 2022 have been found to deliver a variety of malware, including ModernLoader, RedLine Stealer, and cryptocurrency miners onto compromised systems.  "The actors use PowerShell, .NET assemblies, and HTA and VBS files to spread across a targeted network, eventually dropping other pieces of malware, such as the&nbsp; SystemBC &nbsp;trojan and&nbsp; DCRat , to enable various stages of their operations," Cisco Talos researcher Vanja Svajcer said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.

The threat actor behind the attacks on&nbsp; Twilio &nbsp;and&nbsp; Cloudflare &nbsp;earlier this month has been linked to a broader phishing campaign aimed at 136 organizations that resulted in a cumulative compromise of 9,931 accounts.

Calling the attacks well designed and executed, the Singapore-headquartered company said the adversary singled out employees of companies that are customers of identity services provider Okta.   The modus operandi involved sending targets text messages containing links to phishing sites that impersonated the Okta authentication page of the respective targeted entities.

A suspected Iranian threat activity cluster has been linked to attacks aimed at Israeli shipping, government, energy, and healthcare organizations as part of an espionage-focused campaign that commenced in late 2020.  Cybersecurity firm Mandiant is tracking the group under its uncategorized moniker&nbsp; UNC3890 , which is believed to conduct operations that align with Iranian interests.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Donot Team  threat actor has updated its Jaca  Windows malware toolkit with improved capabilities, including a revamped stealer module designed to plunder information from Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers.  The improvements also include a new infection chain that incorporates previously undocumented components to the modular framework, Morphisec researchers Hido Cohen and Arnold Osipov&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a report published last week.  Also known as APT-C-35 and Viceroy Tiger, the Donot Team is known for setting its sights on defense, diplomatic, government, and military entities in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, among others at least since 2016.  Evidence unearthed by Amnesty International in October 2021&nbsp; connected &nbsp;the group's attack infrastructure to an Indian cybersecurity company called Innefu Labs.

Hackers Using Bumblebee Loader to Compromise Active Directory Services<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/hackers-using-bumblebee-loader-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The malware loader known as Bumblebee is being increasingly co-opted by threat actors associated with BazarLoader, TrickBot, and IcedID in their campaigns to breach target networks for post-exploitation activities.  "Bumblebee operators conduct intensive reconnaissance activities and redirect the output of executed commands to files for exfiltration," Cybereason researchers Meroujan Antonyan and Alon Laufer&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up.   Bumblebee &nbsp;first came to light in March 2022 when Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) unmasked the activities of an initial access broker dubbed&nbsp; Exotic Lily &nbsp;with ties to the&nbsp; TrickBot &nbsp;and the larger&nbsp; Conti &nbsp;collectives.   Typically delivered via initial access acquired through spear-phishing campaigns, the modus operandi has since been tweaked by eschewing macro-laced documents in favor of ISO and LNK files, primarily in response to Microsoft's decision to&nbsp; block macros by default .

A Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group named RedAlpha  has been attributed to a multi-year mass credential theft campaign aimed at global humanitarian, think tank, and government organizations.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korea-backed Lazarus Group has been observed targeting job seekers with malware capable of executing on Apple Macs with Intel and M1 chipsets.  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET linked it to a campaign dubbed " Operation In(ter)ception " that was first disclosed in June 2020 and involved using social engineering tactics to trick employees working in the aerospace and military sectors into opening decoy job offer documents.  The latest attack is no different in that a job description for the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange platform was used as a launchpad to drop a signed Mach-O executable. ESET's analysis comes from a sample of the binary that was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil on August 11, 2022.   "Malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets. "It drops three files: a decoy PDF document ' Coinbase_online_careers_2022_07.pdf ', a bundle&nbsp; 'FinderFontsUpdater.app ,' and a downloa

A pair of reports from cybersecurity firms&nbsp; SEKOIA &nbsp;and&nbsp; Trend Micro &nbsp;sheds light on a new campaign undertaken by a Chinese threat actor named Lucky Mouse  that involves leveraging a trojanized version of a cross-platform messaging app to backdoor systems.  Infection chains leverage a chat application called MiMi, with its installer files compromised to download and install HyperBro samples for the Windows operating system and rshell artifacts for Linux and macOS.  As many as 13 different entities located in Taiwan and the Philippines have been at the receiving end of the attacks, eight of whom have been hit with rshell. The first victim of rshell was reported in mid-July 2021.  Lucky Mouse, also called&nbsp; APT27 , Bronze Union, Emissary Panda, and Iron Tiger, is known to be active since 2013 and has a history of gaining access to targeted networks in pursuit of its political and military intelligence-collection objectives aligned with China.

Today's web has made hackers' tasks remarkably easy. For the most part, hackers don't even have to hide in the dark recesses of the web to take advantage of people any longer; they can be found right in plain sight on social media sites or forums, professionally advertised with their websites, and may even approach you anonymously through such channels as Twitter.  Cybercrime has entered a new era where people don't steal just for the thrill of doing it anymore. They make it their business to carry out illegal cyber activities in small groups or individually to earn business from online criminals, selling offensive services like spyware as a service or commercial cybersecurity.  For instance, a series of new DDoS for Hire are commoditizing the art of hacking and reducing the barrier to launching&nbsp; DDoS attacks .

The campaign, which was first spotted by Red Canary in September 2021, has been elusive in that no later-stage activity has been documented nor has there any concrete link tying it to a known threat actor or group.  The disclosure, therefore, marks the first evidence of post-exploitation actions carried out by the threat actor upon leveraging the malware to gain initial access to a Windows machine.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor operating with interests aligned with North Korea has been deploying a malicious extension on Chromium-based web browsers that's capable of stealing email content from Gmail and AOL.  Cybersecurity firm Volexity attributed the malware to an activity cluster it calls&nbsp; SharpTongue , which is said to share overlaps with an&nbsp; adversarial collective &nbsp;publicly referred to under the name&nbsp; Kimsuky .  SharpTongue has a history of singling out individuals working for organizations in the U.S., Europe, and South Korea who "work on topics involving North Korea, nuclear issues, weapons systems, and other matters of strategic interest to North Korea," researchers Paul Rascagneres and Thomas Lancaster&nbsp; said .  Kimsuky 's use of rogue extensions in attacks is not new. In 2018, the actor was&nbsp;seen utilizing a Chrome plugin as part of a campaign called&nbsp; Stolen Pencil &nbsp;to infect victims and steal browser cookies and passwords.

With Microsoft taking steps to block Excel 4.0 (XLM or XL4) and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros by default across Office apps, malicious actors are responding by refining their new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).  "The use of VBA and XL4 Macros decreased approximately 66% from October 2021 through June 2022," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  In its place, adversaries are increasingly pivoting away from macro-enabled documents to other alternatives, including container files such as ISO and RAR as well as Windows Shortcut (LNK) files in campaigns to distribute malware.  "Threat actors pivoting away from directly distributing macro-based attachments in email represents a significant shift in the threat landscape," Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, said in a statement.

Russian Hackers Tricked Ukrainians with Fake "DoS Android Apps to Target Russia"<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/russian-hackers-tricked-ukrainians-with.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Russian threat actors capitalized on the&nbsp; ongoing conflict &nbsp;against Ukraine to distribute Android malware camouflaged as an app for pro-Ukrainian hacktivists to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Russian sites.  Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) attributed the malware to Turla, an advanced persistent threat also known as Krypton, Venomous Bear, Waterbug, and Uroburos, and linked to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).  "This is the first known instance of Turla distributing Android-related malware," TAG researcher Billy Leonard&nbsp; said . "The apps were not distributed through the Google Play Store, but hosted on a domain controlled by the actor and disseminated via links on third party messaging services."   It's worth noting that the&nbsp; onslaught&nbsp; of&nbsp; cyberattacks &nbsp;in the immediate aftermath of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine prompted the latter to&nbsp; form an IT Army &nbsp;to stage counter-DDoS attacks against Russian website

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Russian state-sponsored hacking collective known as APT29 has been attributed to a new phishing campaign that takes advantage of legitimate cloud services like Google Drive and Dropbox to deliver malicious payloads on compromised systems.  "These campaigns are believed to have targeted several Western diplomatic missions between May and June 2022," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. "The lures included in these campaigns suggest targeting of a foreign embassy in Portugal as well as a foreign embassy in Brazil."  APT29, also tracked under the monikers Cozy Bear, Cloaked Ursa, or The Dukes, has been characterized as an organized cyberespionage group working to collect intelligence that aligns with Russia's strategic objectives.  Some aspects of the advanced persistent threat's activities, including the infamous&nbsp; SolarWinds supply chain attack &nbsp;of 2020, are separately tracked by Microsoft under the name Nobelium, with Mandiant calling i

Hackers Distributing Password Cracking Tool for PLCs and HMIs to Target Industrial Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/hackers-distributing-password-cracking.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Industrial engineers and operators are the target of a new campaign that leverages password cracking software to seize control of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and co-opt the machines to a botnet.  The software "exploited a vulnerability in the firmware which allowed it to retrieve the password on command," Dragos security researcher Sam Hanson&nbsp; said . "Further, the software was a malware dropper, infecting the machine with the Sality  malware and turning the host into a peer in Sality's peer-to-peer botnet."  The industrial cybersecurity firm said the password retrieval exploit embedded in the malware dropper is designed to recover the credential associated with Automation Direct&nbsp; DirectLOGIC 06 PLC .   The exploit, tracked as CVE-2022-2003 (CVSS score: 7.7), has been described as a case of cleartext transmission of sensitive data that could lead to information disclosure and unauthorized changes. The issue was&nbsp; addressed &nbsp;in firmware Version 2.72 rele

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious North Korea-backed hacking collective Lazarus Group is suspected to be behind the recent $100 million altcoin theft from Harmony Horizon Bridge, citing similarities to the&nbsp; Ronin bridge attack &nbsp;in March 2022.  The finding comes as Harmony&nbsp; confirmed &nbsp;that its Horizon Bridge, a&nbsp; platform &nbsp;that allows users to move cryptocurrency across different blockchains, had been breached last week.  The incident involved the exploiter carrying out multiple transactions on June 23 that extracted tokens stored in the bridge and subsequently made away with about $100 million in cryptocurrency.  "The stolen crypto assets included Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and BNB," blockchain analytics company Elliptic&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "The thief immediately used Uniswap – a decentralized exchange (DEX) – to convert much of these assets into a total of 85,837 ETH."   Days later, on June 27, the culprit is said to have begun moving funds amounting to $39

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat cluster with ties to a hacking group called Tropic Trooper  has been spotted using a previously undocumented malware coded in Nim language to strike targets as part of a newly discovered campaign.  The novel loader, dubbed Nimbda, is "bundled with a Chinese language greyware 'SMS Bomber' tool that is most likely illegally distributed in the Chinese-speaking web," Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.  "Whoever crafted the Nim loader took special care to give it the same executable icon as the SMS Bomber that it drops and executes," the researchers said. "Therefore the entire bundle works as a trojanized binary."  SMS Bomber, as the name indicates, allows a user to input a phone number (not their own) so as to flood the victim's device with messages and potentially render it unusable in what's a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.   The fact that the binary doubles up as SMS Bomber and a backdoor suggests that t

An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor codenamed ToddyCat  has been linked to a string of attacks aimed at high-profile entities in Europe and Asia since at least December 2020.  The relatively new adversarial collective is said to have commenced its operations by targeting Microsoft Exchange servers in Taiwan and Vietnam using an unknown exploit to deploy the China Chopper web shell and activate a multi-stage infection chain.  Other prominent countries targeted include Afghanistan, India, Indonesia, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Russia, Slovakia, Thailand, the U.K., and Uzbekistan, just as the threat actor evolved its toolset over the course of different campaigns.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a free-to-use browser automation framework that's being increasingly used by threat actors as part of their attack campaigns.  "The framework contains numerous features which we assess may be utilized in the enablement of malicious activities," researchers from Team Cymru&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published Wednesday.  "The technical entry bar for the framework is purposefully kept low, which has served to create an active community of content developers and contributors, with actors in the underground economy advertising their time for the creation of bespoke tooling."   The U.S. cybersecurity company said it observed command-and-control (C2) IP addresses associated with malware such as&nbsp; Bumblebee ,&nbsp; BlackGuard , and&nbsp; RedLine Stealer &nbsp;establishing connections to the downloads subdomain of Bablosoft ("downloads.bablosoft[.]com"), the maker of the Browser Automation Studio (BAS).

A pay-per-install (PPI) malware service known as PrivateLoader has been spotted distributing a "fairly sophisticated" framework called NetDooka, granting attackers complete control over the infected devices.  "The framework is distributed via a pay-per-install (PPI) service and contains multiple parts, including a loader, a dropper, a protection driver, and a full-featured remote access trojan (RAT) that implements its own network communication protocol," Trend Micro&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Thursday.  PrivateLoader, as documented  by Intel 471 in February 2022, functions as a downloader responsible for downloading and installing additional malware onto the infected system, including SmokeLoader, RedLine Stealer, Vidar, Raccoon, GCleaner, and&nbsp; Anubis .

An elusive and sophisticated cyberespionage campaign orchestrated by the China-backed Winnti group has managed to fly under the radar since at least 2019.

Targets included technology and manufacturing companies primarily located in East Asia, Western Europe, and North America.  "The attackers targeted intellectual property developed by the victims, including sensitive documents, blueprints, diagrams, formulas, and manufacturing-related proprietary data," the researchers&nbsp; said .

A newly discovered suspected espionage threat actor has been targeting employees focusing on mergers and acquisitions as well as large corporate transactions to facilitate bulk email collection from victim environments.

The infamous ransomware group known as Conti has&nbsp; continued &nbsp;its onslaught against entities despite suffering a massive data leak of its own earlier this year, according to new research.

One of the most prolific ransomware groups of the last year along the likes of LockBit 2.0, PYSA, and Hive, Conti has locked the networks of hospitals, businesses, and government agencies, while receiving a ransom payment in exchange for sharing the decryption key as part of its name-and-shame scheme.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
China-linked adversaries have been attributed to an ongoing onslaught against Indian power grid organizations, one year after a&nbsp; concerted campaign &nbsp;targeting critical infrastructure in the country came to light.  Most of the intrusions involved a modular backdoor named&nbsp; ShadowPad , according to Recorded Future's Insikt Group, a sophisticated remote access trojan which has been&nbsp; dubbed &nbsp;a "masterpiece of privately sold malware in Chinese espionage."  "ShadowPad continues to be employed by an ever-increasing number of People's Liberation Army (PLA) and Ministry of State Security (MSS)-linked groups, with its origins linked to known MSS contractors first using the tool in their own operations and later likely acting as a digital quartermaster," the researchers&nbsp; said .   The goal of the sustained campaign, the cybersecurity company said, is to facilitate intelligence gathering pertaining to critical infrastructure systems in preparation for future contingency

The notorious cybercrime group known as FIN7 has diversified its initial access vectors to incorporate software supply chain compromise and the use of stolen credentials, new research has revealed.  "Data theft extortion or ransomware deployment following FIN7-attributed activity at multiple organizations, as well as technical overlaps, suggests that FIN7 actors have been associated with various ransomware operations over time," incident response firm Mandiant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday analysis.  The cybercriminal group, since its emergence in the mid-2010s, has gained notoriety for large-scale malware campaigns targeting the point-of-sale (POS) systems aimed at restaurant, gambling, and hospitality industries with credit card-stealing malware.

Multiple Hacker Groups Capitalizing on Ukraine Conflict for Distributing Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/multiple-hacker-groups-capitalizing-on.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
At least three different advanced persistent threat (APT) groups from across the world have launched spear-phishing campaigns in mid-March 2022 using the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war as a lure to distribute malware and steal sensitive information.  The campaigns, undertaken by El Machete, Lyceum, and SideWinder, have targeted a variety of sectors, including energy, financial, and governmental sectors in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan.  "The attackers use decoys ranging from official-looking documents to news articles or even job postings, depending on the targets and region," Check Point Research&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "Many of these lure documents utilize malicious macros or template injection to gain an initial foothold into the targeted organizations, and then launch malware attacks."   The infection chains of&nbsp; El Machete , a Spanish-speaking threat actor first documented in August 2014 by Kaspersky, involve the use of macro-laced decoy doc

The City of London Police on Friday disclosed that it has charged two of the seven teenagers, a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old, who were arrested last week for their alleged connections to the LAPSUS$ data extortion gang.  "Both teenagers have been charged with: three counts of unauthorized access to a computer with intent to impair the reliability of data; one count of fraud by false representation and one count of unauthorized access to a computer with intent to hinder access to data," Detective Inspector Michael O'Sullivan, from the City of London Police,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement.   In addition, the unnamed 16-year-old minor has been charged with one count of causing a computer to perform a function to secure unauthorized access to a program.

North Korean Hackers Distributing Trojanized DeFi Wallet Apps to Steal Victims' Crypto<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/north-korean-hackers-distributing.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korean state-backed hacking crew, otherwise known as the&nbsp; Lazarus Group , has been attributed to yet another financially motivated campaign that leverages a trojanized decentralized finance (DeFi) wallet app to distribute a fully-featured backdoor onto compromised Windows systems.  The app, which is equipped with functionalities to save and manage a cryptocurrency wallet, is also designed to trigger the launch of the implant that can take control of the infected host. Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;it first encountered the rogue application in mid-December 2021.   The infection scheme initiated by the app also results in the deployment of the installer for a legitimate application, which gets overwritten with a trojanized version in an effort to cover its tracks. That said, the initial access avenue is unclear, although it's suspected to be a case of social engineering.  The spawned malware, which masquerades as Google's Chrome web browser, subsequently

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese-speaking threat actor called Scarab  has been linked to a custom backdoor dubbed HeaderTip  as part of a campaign targeting Ukraine since Russia embarked on an invasion last month, making it the second China-based hacking group after&nbsp; Mustang Panda &nbsp;to capitalize on the conflict.  "The malicious activity represents one of the first public examples of a Chinese threat actor targeting Ukraine since the invasion began," SentinelOne researcher Tom Hegel&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week.   SentinelOne's analysis follows an advisory from Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) earlier this week&nbsp; outlining &nbsp;a spear-phishing campaign that leads to the delivery of a RAR archive file, which comes with an executable that's designed to open a decoy file while stealthily dropping a malicious DLL called HeaderTip in the background.

Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) on Thursday disclosed that it acted to mitigate threats from two distinct government-backed attacker groups based in North Korea that exploited a recently-uncovered remote code execution flaw in the Chrome web browser.  The campaigns, once again "reflective of the regime's immediate concerns and priorities," are said to have targeted U.S. based organizations spanning news media, IT, cryptocurrency, and fintech industries, with one set of the activities sharing direct infrastructure overlaps with previous attacks&nbsp; aimed at security researchers &nbsp;last year.  The shortcoming in question is&nbsp; CVE-2022-0609 , a use-after-free vulnerability in the browser's Animation component that Google addressed as part of updates (version 98.0.4758.102) issued on February 14, 2022. It's also the first zero-day flaw patched by the tech giant since the start of 2022.   "The earliest evidence we have of this exploit kit being actively deploy

Luxury hotels in the Chinese special administrative region of Macau were the target of a malicious spear-phishing campaign from the second half of November 2021 and through mid-January 2022.

Yaroslav Vasinskyi , a Ukrainian national, linked to the Russia-based&nbsp; REvil ransomware group &nbsp;has been extradited to the U.S. to face charges for his role in carrying out the file-encrypting malware attacks against several companies, including Kaseya last July.  The 22-year-old had been previously arrested in Poland in October 2021, prompting the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) to&nbsp; file charges &nbsp;of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers, damage to protected computers, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.   Ransomware is the digital equivalent of extortion wherein cybercrime actors encrypt victims' data and take it hostage in return for a monetary payment to recover the data, failing which the stolen information is published online or sold to other third-parties.  According to the DoJ, in addition to the headline-grabbing attacks on JBS and Kaseya, REvil is said to have propagated  its infection to more than 175,000 computers, netting the

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of SMS phone-verified account (PVA) services has led to the discovery of a rogue platform built atop a botnet involving thousands of infected Android phones, once again underscoring the flaws with relying on SMS for account validation.  SMS PVA services, since gaining prevalence in 2018, provide users with alternative mobile numbers that can be used to register for other online services and platforms, and help bypass SMS-based authentication and single sign-on (SSO) mechanisms put in place to verify new accounts.  "This type of service can be used by malicious actors to register disposable accounts in bulk or create phone-verified accounts for conducting fraud and other criminal activities," Trend Micro researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.   Telemetry data gathered by the company shows that most of the infections are located in Indonesia (47,357), followed by Russia (16,157), Thailand (11,196), India (8,109), and France (5,548), Peru (4,915), Moroc

An advanced persistent threat group with links to Iran has updated its malware toolset to include a novel PowerShell-based implant called PowerLess Backdoor , according to new research published by Cybereason.  The Boston-headquartered cybersecurity company attributed the malware to a hacking group known as Charming Kitten (aka Phosphorous, APT35, or&nbsp; TA453 ), while also calling out the backdoor's evasive PowerShell execution.  "The PowerShell code runs in the context of a .NET application, thus not launching 'powershell.exe' which enables it to evade security products," Daniel Frank, senior malware researcher at Cybereason,&nbsp; said . "The toolset analyzed includes extremely modular, multi-staged malware that decrypts and deploys additional payloads in several stages for the sake of both stealth and efficacy."

North Korean Hackers Using Windows Update Service to Infect PCs with Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/north-korean-hackers-using-windows.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious&nbsp; Lazarus Group &nbsp;actor has been observed mounting a new campaign that makes use of the Windows Update service to execute its malicious payload, expanding the arsenal of living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques leveraged by the APT group to further its objectives.  The Lazarus Group, also known as&nbsp; APT38 , Hidden Cobra, Whois Hacking Team, and Zinc, is the moniker assigned to the North Korea-based nation-state hacking group that's been active since at least 2009. Last year, the threat actor was&nbsp; linked &nbsp;to an elaborate&nbsp; social engineering campaign &nbsp;targeting security researchers.   The latest spear-phishing attacks, which&nbsp; Malwarebytes &nbsp;detected on January 18, originate from weaponized documents with job-themed lures impersonating the American global security and aerospace company Lockheed Martin.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A cyberespionage group with ties to North Korea has resurfaced with a stealthier variant of its remote access trojan called Konni to attack political institutions located in Russia and South Korea.  "The authors are constantly making code improvements," Malwarebytes researcher Roberto Santos&nbsp; said . "Their efforts are aimed at breaking the typical flow recorded by sandboxes and making detection harder, especially via regular signatures as critical parts of the executable are now encrypted."   Most&nbsp; recent intrusions &nbsp;staged by the group, believed to be operating under the Kimsuky umbrella, involved targeting the Russian Federation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MID) with New Year lures to compromise Windows systems with malware.   The infections, as with other attacks of this kind, starts with a malicious Microsoft Office document that, when opened, initiates a mult-stage process that involves several moving parts that help the attackers elevate privileges, eva

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new, sophisticated phishing attack has been observed delivering the AsyncRAT trojan as part of a malware campaign that's believed to have commenced in September 2021.  "Through a simple email phishing tactic with an html attachment, threat attackers are delivering AsyncRAT (a remote access trojan) designed to remotely monitor and control its infected computers through a secure, encrypted connection," Michael Dereviashkin, security researcher at enterprise breach prevention firm Morphisec,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.   The intrusions commence with an email message containing an HTML attachment that's disguised as an order confirmation receipt (e.g., Receipt-<digits>.html). Opening the decoy file redirects the message recipient to a web page prompting the user to save an ISO file.  But unlike other attacks that route the victim to a phishing domain set up explicitly for downloading the next-stage malware, the latest RAT campaign cleverly uses JavaScript to locally crea

Misconfigurations in smart contracts are being exploited by scammers to create malicious cryptocurrency tokens with the goal of stealing funds from unsuspecting users.  The instances of token fraud in the wild include hiding 99% fee functions and concealing backdoor routines, researchers from Check Point  said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Smart contracts are&nbsp; programs &nbsp;stored on the blockchain that are automatically executed when predetermined conditions are met according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. They allow trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out between anonymous parties without the need for a central authority.   By examining the&nbsp; Solidity &nbsp;source code used for implementing smart contracts, the Israeli cybersecurity company found instances of&nbsp; hidden &nbsp;and&nbsp; hardcoded fees &nbsp;that can't be changed, while allowing malicious actors to exert control over "who is allowed to sell."

An active espionage campaign has been attributed to the threat actor known as Molerats that abuses legitimate cloud services like Google Drive and Dropbox to host malware payloads and for command-and-control and the exfiltration of data from targets across the Middle East.  The cyber offensive is believed to have been underway since at least July 2021,&nbsp; according &nbsp;to cloud-based information security company Zscaler, continuing&nbsp; previous efforts &nbsp;by the hacking group to conduct reconnaissance on the target hosts and plunder sensitive information.   Molerats , also tracked as TA402, Gaza Hackers Team, and Extreme Jackal, is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that's largely focused on entities operating in the Middle East. Attack activity associated with the actor has leveraged geopolitical and military themes to entice users to open Microsoft Office attachments and click on malicious links.

A previously undocumented firmware implant deployed to maintain stealthy persistence as part of a targeted espionage campaign has been linked to the Chinese-speaking Winnti advanced persistent threat group ( APT41 ).  Kaspersky, which codenamed the rootkit&nbsp; MoonBounce ,&nbsp; characterized &nbsp;the malware as the "most advanced&nbsp; UEFI &nbsp;firmware implant discovered in the wild to date," adding "the purpose of the implant is to facilitate the deployment of user-mode malware that stages execution of further payloads downloaded from the internet."  Firmware-based rootkits, once a rarity in the threat landscape, are fast becoming lucrative tools among sophisticated actors to help achieve long standing foothold in a manner that's not only hard to detect, but also difficult to remove.   The first firmware-level rootkit — dubbed&nbsp; LoJax &nbsp;— was discovered in the wild in 2018.

A threat actor with potential links to an Indian cybersecurity company has been nothing if remarkably persistent in its attacks against military organizations based in South Asia, including Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, since at least September 2020 by deploying different variants of its bespoke malware framework.  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET attributed the highly targeted attack to a hacking group known as&nbsp; Donot Team . "Donot Team has been consistently targeting the same entities with waves of spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments every two to four months," researchers Facundo Muñoz and Matías Porolli&nbsp; said .   Operating since at least 2016, Donot Team (also known as APT-C-35 and SectorE02) has been linked to a string of intrusions primarily targeting embassies, governments, and military entities in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Nepal with Windows and Android malware.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Wednesday disclosed details of a new security vulnerability in SolarWinds Serv-U software that it said was being weaponized by threat actors to propagate attacks leveraging the Log4j flaws to compromise targets.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-35247 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 5.3), the issue is an "input validation vulnerability that could allow attackers to build a query given some input and send that query over the network without sanitation," Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)&nbsp; said .  The flaw, which was discovered by security researcher Jonathan Bar Or, affects Serv-U versions 15.2.5 and prior, and has been addressed in Serv-U version 15.3.   "The Serv-U web login screen to LDAP authentication was allowing characters that were not sufficiently sanitized," SolarWinds&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory, adding it "updated the input mechanism to perform additional validation and sanitization."

The financially motivated&nbsp; FIN8 actor , in all likelihood, has resurfaced with a never-before-seen ransomware strain called " White Rabbit " that was recently deployed against a local bank in the U.S. in December 2021.  That's according to new findings published by Trend Micro, calling out the malware's overlaps with Egregor, which was taken down by Ukrainian law enforcement authorities in February 2021.  "One of the most notable aspects of White Rabbit's attack is how its payload binary requires a specific command-line password to decrypt its internal configuration and proceed with its ransomware routine," the researchers&nbsp; noted . "This method of hiding malicious activity is a trick that the ransomware family Egregor uses to hide malware techniques from analysis."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are actively incorporating public cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft into their malicious campaigns to deliver commodity remote access trojans (RATs) such as&nbsp; Nanocore ,&nbsp; Netwire , and&nbsp; AsyncRAT &nbsp;to siphon sensitive information from compromised systems.  The spear-phishing attacks, which commenced in October 2021, have primarily targeted entities located in the U.S., Canada, Italy, and Singapore, researchers from Cisco Talos said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.  Using existing infrastructure to facilitate intrusions is increasingly becoming part of an attacker's playbook as it obviates the need to host their own servers, not to mention using it as a cloaking mechanism to evade detection by security solutions.   In recent months, collaboration and communication tools like&nbsp; Discord, Slack, and Telegram &nbsp;have found a place in many an infection chain to&nbsp; commandeer and exfiltrate data &nbsp;from the victim machines.

Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps of an organized financial-theft operation undertaken by a discreet actor to target transaction processing systems and siphon funds from entities primarily located in Latin America for at least four years.  The malicious hacking group has been codenamed&nbsp; Elephant Beetle &nbsp;by Israeli incident response firm Sygnia, with the intrusions aimed at banks and retail companies by injecting fraudulent transactions among benign activity to slip under the radar after an extensive study of the targets' financial structures.  "The attack is relentless in its ingenious simplicity serving as an ideal tactic to hide in plain sight, without any need to develop exploits," the researchers said in a report  shared with The Hacker News, calling out the group's overlaps with another tracked by Mandiant as&nbsp; FIN13 , an "industrious" threat actor linked to data theft and ransomware attacks in Mexico stretching back as early as 2016.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft said it won't be fixing or is pushing patches to a later date for three of the four security flaws uncovered in its Teams business communication platform earlier this March.  The disclosure comes from Berlin-based cybersecurity firm Positive Security, which&nbsp; found &nbsp;that the implementation of the link preview feature was susceptible to a number of issues that could "allow accessing internal Microsoft services, spoofing the link preview, and, for Android users, leaking their IP address, and DoS'ing their Teams app/channels."   Of the four vulnerabilities, Microsoft is said to have addressed only one that results in IP address leakage from Android devices, with the tech giant noting that a fix for the denial-of-service (DoS) flaw will be considered in a future version of the product. The issues were responsibly disclosed to the company on March 10, 2021.   Chief among the flaws is a server-side request forgery ( SSRF ) vulnerability in the endpoint "/urlp

Web infrastructure company Cloudflare on Wednesday revealed that threat actors are actively attempting to exploit a&nbsp; second bug &nbsp;disclosed in the widely used Log4j logging utility, making it imperative that customers move quickly to install the latest version as a barrage of attacks continues to pummel unpatched systems with a variety of malware.  The new vulnerability, assigned the identifier&nbsp; CVE-2021-45046 , makes it possible for adversaries to carry out denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and follows disclosure from the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) that the original fix for the remote code execution bug — CVE-2021-44228 aka Log4Shell — was "incomplete in certain non-default configurations." The issue has since been addressed in Log4j version 2.16.0.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors are deploying a previously undiscovered binary, an Internet Information Services ( IIS ) webserver module dubbed " Owowa ," on Microsoft Exchange Outlook Web Access servers with the goal of stealing credentials and enabling remote command execution.  "Owowa is a C#-developed .NET v4.0 assembly that is intended to be loaded as a module within an IIS web server that also exposes Exchange's Outlook Web Access (OWA)," Kaspersky researchers Paul Rascagneres and Pierre Delcher&nbsp; said . "When loaded this way, Owowa will steal credentials that are entered by any user in the OWA login page, and will allow a remote operator to run commands on the underlying server."  The idea that a rogue IIS module can be fashioned as a backdoor is not new. In August 2021, Slovak cybersecurity company ESET's study of the IIS landscape&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;as many as 14 malware families that were developed as native IIS modules in an attempt to intercept HTTP traffic

Hackers Exploit Log4j Vulnerability to Infect Computers with Khonsari Ransomware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/hackers-exploit-log4j-vulnerability-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Romanian cybersecurity technology company Bitdefender on Monday revealed that attempts are being made to target Windows machines with a novel ransomware family called&nbsp; Khonsari &nbsp;as well as a remote access Trojan named&nbsp; Orcus &nbsp;by exploiting the recently disclosed critical Log4j vulnerability .  The attack leverages the remote code execution flaw to download an additional payload, a .NET binary, from a remote server that encrypts all the files with the extension ".khonsari" and displays a ransom note that urges the victims to make a Bitcoin payment in exchange for recovering access to the files.  The vulnerability is tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-44228 &nbsp;and is also known by the monikers "Log4Shell" or "Logjam." In simple terms, the bug could force an affected system to download malicious software, giving the attackers a digital beachhead on servers located within corporate networks.   Log4j is an open-source Java library maintained by the nonprofit Apache Software F

A previously undocumented, financially motivated threat group has been connected to a string of data theft and extortion attacks on over 40 entities between September and November 2021.  The hacker collective, which goes by the self-proclaimed name&nbsp; Karakurt &nbsp;and was first identified in June 2021, is capable of modifying its tactics and techniques to adapt to the targeted environment, Accenture's Cyber Investigations, Forensics and Response (CIFR) team said in a report published on December 10.  "The threat group is financially motivated, opportunistic in nature, and so far, appears to target smaller companies or corporate subsidiaries versus the alternative big game hunting approach," the CIFR team&nbsp; said . "Based on intrusion analysis to date, the threat group focuses solely on data exfiltration and subsequent extortion, rather than the more destructive ransomware deployment."   95% of the known victims are based in North America, while the remaining 5% are in

Nobelium, the threat actor attributed to the massive SolarWinds supply chain compromise, has been once again linked to a series of attacks targeting multiple cloud solution providers, services, and reseller companies, as the hacking group continues to refine and retool its tactics at an alarming pace in response to public disclosures.  The intrusions, which are being tracked by Mandiant under two different activity clusters UNC3004 and UNC2652, are both associated with UNC2452, an&nbsp; uncategorized threat group &nbsp;that has since been tied to the Russian intelligence service. UNC2652, in particular, has been observed targeting diplomatic entities with phishing emails containing HTML attachments with malicious JavaScript, ultimately dropping a Cobalt Strike Beacon onto the infected devices.  "In most instances, post compromise activity included theft of data relevant to Russian interests," Mandiant researchers Luke Jenkins, Sarah Hawley, Parnian Najafi, and Doug Bienstock&nbsp; said &nbsp;in

Microsoft on Monday announced the seizure of 42 domains used by a China-based cyber espionage group that set its sights on organizations in the U.S. and 28 other countries pursuant to a legal warrant issued by a federal court in the U.S. state of Virginia.  The Redmond company attributed the malicious activities to a group it pursues as Nickel , and by the wider cybersecurity industry under the monikers APT15, Bronze Palace, Ke3Chang, Mirage, Playful Dragon, and Vixen Panda. The advanced persistent threat (APT) actor is believed to have been active since at least 2012.  "Nickel has targeted organizations in both the private and public sectors, including diplomatic organizations and ministries of foreign affairs in North America, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, Europe and Africa," Microsoft's Corporate Vice President for Customer Security and Trust, Tom Burt, said .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Three different state-sponsored threat actors aligned with China, India, and Russia have been observed adopting a new method called&nbsp; RTF &nbsp;(aka Rich Text Format) template injection as part of their phishing campaigns to deliver malware to targeted systems.  "RTF template injection is a novel technique that is ideal for malicious phishing attachments because it is simple and allows threat actors to retrieve malicious content from a remote URL using an RTF file," Proofpoint researchers said in a new report  shared with The Hacker News.   At the heart of the attack is an RTF file containing decoy content that can be&nbsp; manipulated &nbsp;to enable the retrieval of content, including malicious payloads, hosted at an external URL upon opening an RTF file. Specifically, it leverages the RTF&nbsp; template functionality &nbsp;to alter a document's formatting properties using a&nbsp; hex editor &nbsp;by specifying a URL resource instead of an accessible file resource destination from which a remote payload

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government, diplomatic entities, military organizations, law firms, and financial institutions primarily located in the Middle East have been targeted as part of a stealthy malware campaign as early as 2019 by making use of malicious Microsoft Excel and Word documents.  Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky attributed the attacks with high confidence to a threat actor named WIRTE, adding the intrusions involved "MS Excel droppers that use hidden spreadsheets and VBA macros to drop their first stage implant," which is a Visual Basic Script (VBS) with functionality to amass system information and execute arbitrary code sent by the attackers on the infected machine.  An analysis of the campaign as well as the toolset and methods employed by the adversary has also led the researchers to conclude with low confidence that the&nbsp; WIRTE group &nbsp;has connections to another politically motivated collective called the&nbsp; Gaza Cybergang .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are exploiting improperly-secured Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instances to download cryptocurrency mining software to the compromised systems as well as abusing its infrastructure to install ransomware, stage phishing campaigns, and even generate traffic to YouTube videos for view count manipulation.  "While cloud customers continue to face a variety of threats across applications and infrastructure, many successful attacks are due to poor hygiene and a lack of basic control implementation," Google's Cybersecurity Action Team (CAT)&nbsp; outlined &nbsp;as part of its recent Threat Horizons report published last week.   Of the 50 recently compromised GCP instances, 86% of them were used to conduct cryptocurrency mining, in some cases within 22 seconds of successful breach, while 10% of the instances were exploited to perform scans of other publicly accessible hosts on the Internet to identify vulnerable systems, and 8% of the instances were used to strike other entiti

Hackers Targeting Biomanufacturing Facilities With Tardigrade Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/hackers-targeting-biomanufacturing.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An advanced persistent threat (APT) has been linked to cyberattacks on two biomanufacturing companies that occurred this year with the help of a custom malware loader called " Tardigrade ."  That's according to an advisory published by Bioeconomy Information Sharing and Analysis Center (BIO-ISAC) this week, which noted that the malware is actively spreading across the sector with the likely goal of perpetrating intellectual property theft, maintaining persistence for extended periods of time, and infecting the systems with ransomware.   BIO-ISAC, which commenced an investigation following a ransomware attack targeting an unnamed biomanufacturing facility earlier this spring, characterized Tardigrade as a sophisticated piece of malware with "a high degree of autonomy as well as metamorphic capabilities." The same malware was then used to strike a second entity in October 2021.  The "actively spreading" intrusions have not been attributed to a specific

A new malware campaign has been discovered targeting cryptocurrency, non-fungible token ( NFT ), and&nbsp; DeFi &nbsp;aficionados through Discord channels to deploy a crypter named "Babadeda" that's capable of bypassing antivirus solutions and stage a variety of attacks.  "[T]his malware installer has been used in a variety of recent campaigns to deliver information stealers, RATs, and even LockBit ransomware," Morphisec researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. The malware distribution attacks are said to have commenced in May 2021.   Crypters are a type of software used by cybercriminals that can encrypt, obfuscate, and manipulate malicious code so as to appear seemingly innocuous and make it harder to detect by security programs — a holy grail for malware authors.  The infiltrations observed by Morphisec involved the threat actor sending decoy messages to prospective users on Discord channels related to blockchain-based games such as&nbsp; Mines of Dalarnia , urg

A new Iranian threat actor has been discovered exploiting a now-addressed critical flaw in the Microsoft Windows MSHTML platform to target Farsi-speaking victims with a new PowerShell-based information stealer designed to harvest extensive details from infected machines.  "[T]he stealer is a PowerShell script, short with powerful collection capabilities — in only ~150 lines, it provides the adversary a lot of critical information including screen captures, Telegram files, document collection, and extensive data about the victim's environment," SafeBreach Labs researcher Tomer Bar&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Wednesday.   Nearly half of the targets are from the U.S., with the cybersecurity firm noting that the attacks are likely aimed at "Iranians who live abroad and might be seen as a threat to Iran's Islamic regime."  The phishing campaign, which began in July 2021, involved the exploitation of CVE-2021-40444, a remote code execution flaw that could be exp

Attackers are actively making efforts to exploit a new variant of a recently disclosed privilege escalation vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code on fully-patched systems, once again demonstrating how adversaries move quickly to weaponize a publicly available exploit.  Cisco Talos&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;that it "detected malware samples in the wild that are attempting to take advantage of this vulnerability."

However, in what's a case of an insufficient patch, Naceri found that it was not only possible to bypass the fix implemented by Microsoft but also&nbsp; achieve &nbsp;local privilege escalation via a newly discovered zero-day bug.

Nation-state operators with nexus to Iran are increasingly turning to ransomware as a means of generating revenue and intentionally sabotaging their targets, while also engaging in patient and persistent social engineering campaigns and aggressive brute force attacks.  No less than six threat actors affiliated with the West Asian country have been discovered deploying ransomware to achieve their strategic objectives, researchers from Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)&nbsp; revealed , adding "these ransomware deployments were launched in waves every six to eight weeks on average."   Of note is a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; Phosphorus &nbsp;(aka Charming Kitten or APT35), which has been found scanning IP addresses on the internet for unpatched Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPN and on-premises Exchange Servers to gain initial access and persistence on vulnerable networks, before moving to deploy additional payloads that enable the actors to pivot to other machines and deploy ransomware.

A malicious campaign has been found leveraging a technique called domain fronting to hide command-and-control traffic by leveraging a legitimate domain owned by the Myanmar government to route communications to an attacker-controlled server with the goal of evading detection.  The threat, which was observed in September 2021, deployed Cobalt Strike payloads as a stepping stone for launching further attacks, with the adversary using a domain associated with the Myanmar Digital News network, a state-owned digital newspaper, as a front for their Beacons.  "When the Beacon is launched, it will submit a DNS request for a legitimate high-reputation domain hosted behind Cloudflare infrastructure and modify the subsequent HTTPs requests header to instruct the CDN to direct the traffic to an attacker-controlled host," Cisco Talos researchers Chetan Raghuprasad, Vanja Svajcer, and Asheer Malhotra&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical analysis published Tuesday.

New 'Moses Staff' Hacker Group Targets Israeli Companies With Destructive Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/new-moses-staff-hacker-group-targets.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new politically-motivated hacker group named " Moses Staff " has been linked to a wave of targeted attacks targeting Israeli organizations since September 2021 with the goal of plundering and leaking sensitive information prior to encrypting their networks, with no option to regain access or negotiate a ransom.  "The group openly states that their motivation in attacking Israeli companies is to cause damage by leaking the stolen sensitive data and encrypting the victim's networks, with no ransom demand," Check Point Research&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Monday. "In the language of the attackers, their purpose is to 'Fight against the resistance and expose the crimes of the Zionists in the occupied territories.'"  At least 16 victims have had their data leaked to date, according to stats released by the collective.

Researchers Demonstrate New Fingerprinting Attack on Tor Encrypted Traffic<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/researchers-demonstrate-new.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new analysis of website fingerprinting (WF) attacks aimed at the Tor web browser has revealed that it's possible for an adversary to glean a website frequented by a victim, but only in scenarios where the threat actor is interested in a specific subset of the websites visited by users.  "While attacks can exceed 95% accuracy when monitoring a small set of five popular websites, indiscriminate (non-targeted) attacks against sets of 25 and 100 websites fail to exceed an accuracy of 80% and 60%, respectively," researchers Giovanni Cherubin, Rob Jansen, and Carmela Troncoso&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a newly published paper.   Tor browser&nbsp; offers &nbsp;"unlinkable communication" to its users by routing internet traffic through an overlay network, consisting of more than six thousand relays, with the goal of anonymizing the originating location and usage from third parties conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. It achieves this by building a circuit that traverses via an

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Lazarus, the North Korea-affiliated state-sponsored group, is attempting to once again target security researchers with backdoors and remote access trojans using a trojanized pirated version of the popular IDA Pro reverse engineering software.  The findings were&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by ESET security researcher Anton Cherepanov last week in a series of tweets.  IDA Pro is an&nbsp; Interactive Disassembler &nbsp;that's designed to translate machine language (aka executables) into assembly language, enabling security researchers to analyze the inner workings of a program (malicious or otherwise) as well as function as a debugger to detect errors.   "Attackers bundled the original IDA Pro 7.5 software developed by [Hex-Rays] with two malicious components," the Slovak cybersecurity firm said, one of which is an internal module called "win_fw.dll" that's executed during installation of the application. This tampered version is then orchestrated to load a second component named "

Hackers Increasingly Using HTML Smuggling in Malware and Phishing Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/hackers-increasingly-using-html.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are increasingly banking on the technique of&nbsp; HTML smuggling &nbsp;in phishing campaigns as a means to gain initial access and deploy an array of threats, including banking malware, remote administration trojans (RATs), and ransomware payloads.  Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team, in a new report published Thursday, disclosed that it identified infiltrations distributing the&nbsp; Mekotio &nbsp;banking Trojan, backdoors such as&nbsp; AsyncRAT &nbsp;and&nbsp; NjRAT , and the infamous&nbsp; TrickBot &nbsp;malware. The multi-staged attacks — dubbed&nbsp; ISOMorph &nbsp;— were also publicly documented by Menlo Security in July 2021.   HTML smuggling is an approach that allows an attacker to "smuggle" first-stage droppers, often encoded malicious scripts embedded within specially-crafted HTML attachment or web pages, on a victim machine by taking advantage of basic features in HTML5 and JavaScript rather than exploiting a vulnerability or a design flaw in modern web browsers.  By doing so, it enables t

Google researchers on Thursday disclosed that it found a watering hole attack in late August exploiting a now-parched zero-day in macOS operating system and targeting Hong Kong websites related to a media outlet and a prominent pro-democracy labor and political group to deliver a never-before-seen backdoor on compromised machines.

A state-sponsored threat actor allegedly affiliated with Iran has been linked to a series of targeted attacks aimed at internet service providers (ISPs) and telecommunication operators in Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia, as well as a ministry of foreign affairs (MFA) in Africa, new findings reveal.

The names of the victims were not disclosed.  The latest revelations throw light on the web-based infrastructure used by Lyceum, over 20 of them, enabling the identification of "additional victims and provide further visibility into Lyceum's targeting methodology," the researchers&nbsp; noted , adding "at least two of the identified compromises are assessed to be ongoing despite prior public discl

The threat landscape as we know it has been increasingly dominated by a category of players known as the initial access brokers ( IABs ), who are known to provide other cyber-criminal groups, including ransomware affiliates, with a&nbsp; foothold to an infinite pool of potential organizations &nbsp;belonging to diverse geographies and sectors via persistent backdoors into the victim networks, effectively building a pricing model for remote access.   &amp;

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ukraine's premier law enforcement and counterintelligence agency on Thursday disclosed the real identities of five individuals allegedly involved in cyberattacks attributed to a cyber-espionage group named Gamaredon , linking the members to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).  Calling the hacker group "an FSB special project, which specifically targeted Ukraine," the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;the perpetrators "are officers of the 'Crimean' FSB and traitors who defected to the enemy during the occupation of the peninsula in 2014."   The names of the five individuals the SSU alleges are part of the covert operation are Sklianko Oleksandr Mykolaiovych, Chernykh Mykola Serhiiovych, Starchenko Anton Oleksandrovych, Miroshnychenko Oleksandr Valeriiovych, and Sushchenko Oleh Oleksandrovych.

Google to Pay Hackers $31,337 for Exploiting Patched Linux Kernel Flaws<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/google-to-pay-hackers-31337-for.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Monday announced that it will pay security researchers to find exploits using vulnerabilities, previously remediated or otherwise, over the next three months as part of a new bug bounty program to improve the security of the Linux kernel.  To that end, the company is expected to issue rewards worth $31,337 for exploiting privilege escalation in a lab environment for each patched vulnerability, an amount that can climb up to $50,337 for working exploits that take advantage of zero-day flaws in the kernel and other undocumented attack techniques.   Specifically, the program aims to uncover attacks that could be launched against Kubernetes-based infrastructure to defeat process isolation barriers (via NSJail) and break out of the sandbox to leak secret information.   The program is expected to last until January 31, 2022.  "It is important to note, that the easiest exploitation primitives are not available in our lab environment due to the hardening done on&nbsp; Container-Opti

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Over 70% of Wi-Fi networks from a sample size of 5,000 were hacked with "relative ease" in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, highlighting how unsecure Wi-Fi passwords can become a gateway for serious threats to individuals, small businesses, and enterprises alike.  CyberArk security researcher Ido Hoorvitch, who used a Wi-Fi sniffing equipment costing about $50 to collect 5,000 network hashes for the study,&nbsp; said &nbsp;"the process of sniffing Wi-Fis and the subsequent cracking procedures was a very accessible undertaking in terms of equipment, costs and execution."   The new Wi-Fi attack builds on&nbsp; previous findings &nbsp;by Jens "atom" Steube in 2018 that involves capturing what's called the PMKIDs associated with a client (aka SSID) in order to attempt a brute-force attack using password recovery tools like hashcat.   PMKID is a&nbsp; unique key identifier &nbsp;used by the access point (AP) to keep track of the pre-shared key — i.e., pairwise master key aka PMK — being u

Nobelium, the&nbsp; threat actor &nbsp;behind the SolarWinds compromise in December 2020, has been behind a new wave of attacks that compromised 14 downstream customers of multiple cloud service providers (CSP), managed service providers (MSP), and other IT services organizations, illustrating the adversary's continuing interest in targeting the supply chain via the "compromise-one-to-compromise-many" approach.  Microsoft, which disclosed details of the campaign on Monday, said it notified more than 140 resellers and technology service providers since May. Between July 1 and October 19, 2021, Nobelium is said to have singled out 609 customers, who were collectively attacked a grand total of 22,868 times.   "This recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling – now or in the future – targets of interest to the Russian government,"

Since at least late 2019, a network of hackers-for-hire have been hijacking the channels of YouTube creators, luring them with bogus collaboration opportunities to broadcast cryptocurrency scams or sell the accounts to the highest bidder.  That's according to a new report published by Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), which said it disrupted financially motivated phishing campaigns targeting the video platform with cookie theft malware. The actors behind the infiltration have been attributed to a group of hackers recruited in a Russian-speaking forum.   "Cookie Theft, also known as 'pass-the-cookie attack,' is a&nbsp;session hijacking&nbsp;technique that enables access to user accounts with session cookies stored in the browser," TAG's Ashley Shen&nbsp; said . "While the technique has been around for decades, its resurgence as a top security risk could be due to a wider adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) making it difficult to conduct abuse, and shif

Researchers Break Intel SGX With New 'SmashEx' CPU Attack Technique<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/researchers-break-intel-sgx-with-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly disclosed vulnerability affecting Intel processors could be abused by an adversary to gain access to sensitive information stored within enclaves and even run arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.  The vulnerability ( CVE-2021-0186 , CVSS score: 8.2) was discovered by a group of academics from ETH Zurich, the National University of Singapore, and the Chinese National University of Defense Technology in early May 2021, who used it to stage a confidential data disclosure attack called " SmashEx " that can corrupt private data housed in the enclave and break its integrity.   Introduced with Intel's Skylake processors, SGX (short for Software Guard eXtensions) allows developers to run selected application modules in a completely isolated secure compartment of memory, called an enclave or a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which is designed to be protected from processes running at higher privilege levels like the operating system. SGX ensures that data is secure

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor, previously known for striking organizations in the energy and telecommunications sectors across the Middle East as early as April 2018, has evolved its malware arsenal to strike two entities in Tunisia.  Security researchers at Kaspersky, who presented their findings at the VirusBulletin VB2021 conference earlier this month, attributed the attacks to a group tracked as&nbsp; Lyceum &nbsp;(aka Hexane), which was first&nbsp; publicly documented &nbsp;in 2019 by Secureworks.   "The victims we observed were all high-profile Tunisian organizations, such as telecommunications or aviation companies," researchers Aseel Kayal, Mark Lechtik, and Paul Rascagneres&nbsp; detailed . "Based on the targeted industries, we assume that the attackers might have been interested in compromising such entities to track the movements and communications of individuals of interest to them."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An emerging threat actor likely supporting Iranian national interests has been behind a password spraying campaign targeting US, EU, and Israeli defense technology companies, with additional activity observed against regional ports of entry in the Persian Gulf as well as maritime and cargo transportation companies focused in the Middle East.  Microsoft is tracking the hacking crew under the moniker DEV-0343 .  The intrusions, which were first observed in late July 2021, are believed to have targeted more than 250 Office 365 tenants, fewer than 20 of which were successfully compromised following a&nbsp; password spray &nbsp;attack — a type of brute force attack wherein the same password is cycled against different usernames to log into an application or a network in an effort to avoid account lockouts.

Details have emerged about a new cyber espionage campaign directed against the aerospace and telecommunications industries, primarily in the Middle East, with the goal of stealing sensitive information about critical assets, organizations' infrastructure, and technology while remaining in the dark and successfully evading security solutions.  Boston-based cybersecurity company Cybereason dubbed the attacks " Operation Ghostshell ," pointing out the use of a previously undocumented and stealthy remote access trojan (RAT) called ShellClient that's deployed as the main spy tool of choice. The first sign of the attacks was observed in July 2021 against a handpicked set of victims, indicating a highly targeted approach.  "The ShellClient RAT has been under ongoing development since at least 2018, with several iterations that introduced new functionalities, while it evaded antivirus tools and managed to remain undetected and publicly unknown," researchers Tom Fak

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A formerly unknown Chinese-speaking threat actor has been linked to a long-standing evasive operation aimed at South East Asian targets as far back as July 2020 to deploy a kernel-mode rootkit on compromised Windows systems.  Attacks mounted by the hacking group, dubbed&nbsp; GhostEmperor &nbsp;by Kaspersky, are also said to have used a "sophisticated multi-stage malware framework" that allows for providing persistence and remote control over the targeted hosts.  The Russian cybersecurity firm called the rootkit Demodex , with infections reported across several high-profile entities in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia, in addition to outliers located in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Afghanistan.   "[Demodex] is used to hide the user mode malware's artefacts from investigators and security solutions, while demonstrating an interesting undocumented loading scheme involving the kernel mode component of an open-source project named&nbsp; Cheat Engine &nbsp;to bypass the Windows Driver Sig

New Tomiris Backdoor Found Linked to Hackers Behind SolarWinds Cyberattack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/new-tomiris-backdoor-found-linked-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed a previously undocumented backdoor likely designed and developed by the Nobelium advanced persistent threat (APT) behind last year's&nbsp; SolarWinds supply chain attack , joining the threat actor's ever-expanding arsenal of hacking tools.  Moscow-headquartered firm Kaspersky codenamed the malware " Tomiris ,"&nbsp;calling out its similarities to another second-stage malware used during the campaign, SUNSHUTTLE (aka GoldMax), targeting the IT management software provider's Orion platform. Nobelium is also known by the monikers UNC2452, SolarStorm, StellarParticle, Dark Halo, and Iron Ritual.   "While supply-chain attacks were already a documented attack vector leveraged by a number of APT actors, this specific campaign stood out due to the extreme carefulness of the attackers and the high-profile nature of their victims," Kaspersky researchers&nbsp; said . "Evidence gathered so far indicates that Dark Halo spent si

Two newly discovered malicious Android applications on Google Play Store have been used to target users of Brazil's instant payment ecosystem in a likely attempt to lure victims into fraudulently transferring their entire account balances into another bank account under cybercriminals' control.  "The attackers distributed two different variants of banking malware, named PixStealer  and MalRhino , through two separate malicious applications […] to carry out their attacks," Check Point  Research said in an analysis shared with The Hacker News. "Both malicious applications were designed to steal money of victims through user interaction and the original PIX application."  The two apps in question, which were uncovered in April 2021, have since been removed from the app store.

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a novel technique adopted by threat actors to deliberately evade detection with the help of malformed digital signatures of its malware payloads.  "Attackers created malformed code signatures that are treated as valid by Windows but are not able to be decoded or checked by OpenSSL code — which is used in a number of security scanning products," Google Threat Analysis Group's Neel Mehta&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published on Thursday.   The new mechanism was observed to be exploited by a notorious family of unwanted software known as&nbsp; OpenSUpdater &nbsp;that's used to download and install other suspicious programs on compromised systems. Most targets of the campaign are users located in the U.S. who are prone to downloading cracked versions of games and other grey-area software.

Microsoft has shared technical details about a now-fixed, actively exploited critical security vulnerability affecting SolarWinds Serv-U managed file transfer service that it has attributed with "high confidence" to a threat actor operating out of China.  In mid-July, the Texas-based company&nbsp; remedied &nbsp;a remote code execution flaw ( CVE-2021-35211 ) that was rooted in Serv-U's implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which could be abused by attackers to run arbitrary code on the infected system, including the ability to install malicious programs and view, change, or delete sensitive data.   "The Serv-U SSH server is subject to a pre-auth remote code execution vulnerability that can be easily and reliably exploited in the default configuration," Microsoft Offensive Research and Security Engineering team said in a&nbsp; detailed write-up &nbsp;describing the exploit.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recent wave of spear-phishing campaigns leveraged weaponized Windows 11 Alpha-themed Word documents with Visual Basic macros to drop malicious payloads, including a JavaScript implant, against a point-of-sale (PoS) service provider located in the U.S.  The attacks, which are believed to have taken place between late June to late July 2021, have been attributed with "moderate confidence" to a financially motivated threat actor dubbed FIN7, according to researchers from cybersecurity firm Anomali.  "The specified targeting of the Clearmind domain fits well with FIN7's preferred modus operandi," Anomali Threat Research&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical analysis published on September 2. "The group's goal appears to have been to deliver a variation of a JavaScript backdoor used by FIN7 since at least 2018."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
IT and communication companies in Israel were at the center of a supply chain attack campaign spearheaded by an Iranian threat actor that involved impersonating the firms and their HR personnel to target victims with fake job offers in an attempt to penetrate their computers and gain access to the company's clients.  The attacks, which occurred in two waves in May and July 2021, have been linked to a hacker group called Siamesekitten (aka Lyceum or Hexane) that has primarily singled out oil, gas, and telecom providers in the Middle East and in Africa at least since 2018, researchers from ClearSky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday.   Infections undertaken by the adversary commenced with identifying potential victims, who were then enticed with "alluring" job offers in well-known companies like ChipPc and Software AG by posing as human resources department employees from the impersonated firms, only to lead the victims to a phishing website containing weaponized files t

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has disclosed details of an evasive year-long social engineering campaign wherein the operators kept changing their obfuscation and encryption mechanisms every 37 days on average, including relying on Morse code, in an attempt to cover their tracks and surreptitiously harvest user credentials.  The phishing attacks take the form of invoice-themed lures mimicking financial-related business transactions, with the emails containing an HTML file ("XLS.HTML"). The ultimate objective is to harvest usernames and passwords, which are subsequently used as an initial entry point for later infiltration attempts.   Microsoft likened the attachment to a "jigsaw puzzle," noting that individual parts of the HTML file are designed to appear innocuous and slip past endpoint security software, only to reveal its true colors when these segments are decoded and assembled together. The company did not identify the hackers behind the operation.  "This phishing campaign ex

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese cyber espionage group has been linked to a string of intrusion activities targeting Israeli government institutions, IT providers, and telecommunications companies at least since 2019.  FireEye's Mandiant threat intelligence arm attributed the campaign to an operator it tracks as "UNC215", a Chinese espionage operation that's believed to have singled out organizations around the world dating back as far as 2014, linking the group with "low confidence" to an advanced persistent threat (APT) widely known as&nbsp; APT27 , Emissary Panda, or Iron Tiger.  "UNC215 has compromised organizations in the government, technology, telecommunications, defense, finance, entertainment, and health care sectors," FireEye's Israel and U.S. threat intel teams&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today.

Unidentified threat actors are actively exploiting a critical authentication bypass vulnerability to hijack home routers as part of an effort to co-opt them to a Mirai-variant botnet used for carrying out DDoS attacks, merely two days after its public disclosure.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-20090 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.9), the&nbsp; weakness &nbsp;concerns a&nbsp; path traversal vulnerability &nbsp;in the web interfaces of&nbsp; routers with Arcadyan firmware &nbsp;that could allow unauthenticated remote attackers to bypass authentication.   Disclosed by Tenable on August 3, the issue is believed to have existed for at least 10 years, affecting at least 20 models across 17 different vendors, including Asus, Beeline, British Telecom, Buffalo, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telstra, Telus, Verizon, and Vodafone.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Three distinct clusters of malicious activities operating on behalf of Chinese state interests have staged a series of attacks to target networks belonging to at least five major telecommunications companies located in Southeast Asian countries since 2017.  "The goal of the attackers behind these intrusions was to gain and maintain continuous access to telecommunication providers and to facilitate cyber espionage by collecting sensitive information, compromising high-profile business assets such as the billing servers that contain Call Detail Record (CDR) data, as well as key network components such as the Domain Controllers, Web Servers and Microsoft Exchange servers," Cybereason's Lior Rochberger, Tom Fakterman, Daniel Frank, and Assaf Dahan&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;in a technical analysis published Tuesday.

An unidentified threat actor has been exploiting a now-patched zero-day flaw in Internet Explorer browser to deliver a fully-featured VBA-based remote access trojan (RAT) capable of accessing files stored in compromised Windows systems, and downloading and executing malicious payloads as part of an "unusual" campaign.  The backdoor is distributed via a decoy document named "Manifest.docx" that loads the exploit code for the vulnerability from an embedded template, which, in turn, executes shellcode to deploy the RAT, according to cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes, which spotted the suspicious Word file on July 21, 2021.&nbsp; The malware-laced document claims to be a "Manifesto of the inhabitants of Crimea" calling on the citizens to oppose Russian President Vladimir Putin and "create a unified platform called 'People's Resistance.'"

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese cyberespionage group known for targeting Southeast Asia leveraged flaws in the Microsoft Exchange Server that came to light earlier this March to deploy a previously undocumented variant of a remote access trojan (RAT) on compromised systems.  Attributing the intrusions to a threat actor named&nbsp; PKPLUG &nbsp;(aka&nbsp; Mustang Panda &nbsp;and HoneyMyte), Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team said it identified a new version of the modular PlugX malware, called Thor, that was delivered as a post-exploitation tool to one of the breached servers.  Dating back to as early as 2008,&nbsp; PlugX &nbsp;is a fully-featured second-stage implant with capabilities such as file upload, download, and modification, keystroke logging, webcam control, and access to a remote command shell.   "The variant observed [...] is unique in that it contains a change to its core source code: the replacement of its trademark word 'PLUG' to 'THOR,'" Unit 42 researchers Mike Harbison an

An Iranian cyberespionage group masqueraded as an aerobics instructor on Facebook in an attempt to infect the machine of an employee of an aerospace defense contractor with malware as part of a years-long social engineering and targeted malware campaign.  Enterprise security firm Proofpoint attributed the covert operation to a state-aligned threat actor it tracks as TA456, and by the wider cybersecurity community under the monikers Tortoiseshell and Imperial Kitten.   "Using the social media persona 'Marcella Flores,' TA456 built a relationship across corporate and personal communication platforms with an employee of a small subsidiary of an aerospace defense contractor," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "In early June 2021, the threat actor attempted to capitalize on this relationship by sending the target malware via an ongoing email communication chain."

Hackers Use New Trick to Disable Macro Security Warnings in Malicious Office Files<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/hackers-use-new-trick-to-disable-macro.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
While it's a norm for phishing campaigns that distribute weaponized Microsoft Office documents to prompt victims to enable macros in order to trigger the infection chain directly, new findings indicate attackers are using non-malicious documents to disable security warnings prior to executing macro code to infect victims' computers.  In yet another instance of malware authors continue to evolve their techniques to evade detection, researchers from McAfee Labs stumbled upon a novel tactic that "downloads and executes malicious DLLs (ZLoader) without any malicious code present in the initial spammed attachment macro."   ZLoader&nbsp;infections  propagated using this mechanism have been primarily reported in the U.S., Canada, Spain, Japan, and Malaysia, the cybersecurity firm noted. The malware — a descendant of the infamous ZeuS banking trojan — is well known for aggressively using macro-enabled Office documents as an initial attack vector to steal credentials and personall

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Friday said it's investigating an incident wherein a driver signed by the company turned out to be a malicious Windows rootkit that was observed communicating with command-and-control (C2) servers located in China.  The driver, called " Netfilter ," is said to target gaming environments, specifically in the East Asian country, with the Redmond-based firm noting that "the actor's goal is to use the driver to spoof their geo-location to cheat the system and play from anywhere."   "The malware enables them to gain an advantage in games and possibly exploit other players by compromising their accounts through common tools like keyloggers," Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)&nbsp; said .  The rogue code signing was spotted by Karsten Hahn, a malware analyst at German cybersecurity company G Data, who shared&nbsp; additional details &nbsp;of the rootkit, including a&nbsp; dropper , which is used to deploy and install Netfilter on the system.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor with suspected ties to Pakistan has been striking government and energy organizations in the South and Central Asia regions to deploy a remote access trojan on compromised Windows systems, according to new research.  "Most of the organizations that exhibited signs of compromise were in India, and a small number were in Afghanistan," Lumen's Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. "The potentially compromised victims aligned with the government and power utility verticals."  Some of the victims include a foreign government organization, a power transmission organization, and a power generation and transmission organization. The covert operation is said to have begun at least in January 2021.   The intrusions are notable for a number of reasons, not least because in addition to its highly-targeted nature, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted by the adversary rely on repurposed open-source code and the use of compromised dom

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A string of cyber espionage campaigns dating all the way back to 2014 and focused on gathering military intelligence from neighbouring countries have been linked to a Chinese military-intelligence apparatus.  In a wide-ranging report published by Massachusetts-headquartered Recorded Future this week, the cybersecurity firm's Insikt Group said it identified ties between a group it tracks as " RedFoxtrot " to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Unit 69010 operating out of Ürümqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the country.   Previously called the Lanzhou Military Region's Second Technical Reconnaissance Bureau, Unit 69010 is a military cover for a Technical Reconnaissance Bureau (TRB) within China's Strategic Support Force (SSF) Network Systems Department ( NSD ).   The connection to PLA Unit 69010 stems from what the researchers said were "lax operational security measures" adopted by an unnamed suspected RedFoxtrot threat act

A North Korean threat actor active since 2012 has been behind a new espionage campaign targeting high-profile government officials associated with its southern counterpart to install an Android and Windows backdoor for collecting sensitive information.  Cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the activity to a threat actor tracked as Kimsuky, with the targeted entities comprising of the Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador of the Embassy of Sri Lanka to the State, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Nuclear Security Officer, Deputy Consul General at Korean Consulate General in Hong Kong, Seoul National University, and Daishin Securities.   The development is only the latest in a series of surveillance efforts aimed at South Korea. Believed to be operating on behalf of the North Korean regime, Kimsuky (aka Velvet Chollima, Black Banshee, and Thallium) has a track record of singling out South Korean entities while expanding their

Researchers Demonstrate 2 New Hacks to Modify Certified PDF Documents<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/researchers-demonstrate-2-new-hacks-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed two new attack techniques on certified PDF documents that could potentially enable an attacker to alter a document's visible content by displaying malicious content over the certiﬁed content without invalidating its signature.  "The attack idea exploits the flexibility of PDF certification, which allows signing or adding annotations to certified documents under different permission levels,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;researchers from Ruhr-University Bochum, who have&nbsp; systematically &nbsp; analyzed &nbsp;the security of the PDF specification over the years.  The findings were presented at the 42nd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ( IEEE S&amp;P 2021 ) held this week.  The two attacks — dubbed&nbsp; Evil Annotation and Sneaky Signature attacks &nbsp;— hinge on manipulating the PDF certification process by exploiting flaws in the specification that governs the implementation of digital signatures (aka approval signature) and its more flexible variant called certifica

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers from FireEye unmasked additional tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted by Chinese threat actors who were recently found abusing Pulse Secure VPN devices to drop malicious web shells and exfiltrate sensitive information from enterprise networks.  FireEye's Mandiant threat intelligence team, which is tracking the cyberespionage activity under two threat clusters UNC2630 and UNC2717,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the intrusions line up with key Chinese government priorities, adding "many compromised organizations operate in verticals and industries aligned with Beijing's strategic objectives outlined in China's recent&nbsp; 14th Five Year Plan ."   On April 20, the cybersecurity firm&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;12 different malware families, including STEADYPULSE and LOCKPICK, that have been designed with the express intent to infect Pulse Secure VPN appliances and put to use by several cyberespionage groups believed to be affiliated with the Chinese government.

Hackers Using Fake Foundations to Target Uyghur Minority in China<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/hackers-using-fake-foundations-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Uyghur community located in China and Pakistan has been the subject of an ongoing espionage campaign aiming to trick the targets into downloading a Windows backdoor to amass sensitive information from their systems.  "Considerable effort was put into disguising the payloads, whether by creating delivery documents that appear to be originating from the United Nations using up to date related themes, or by setting up websites for non-existing organizations claiming to fund charity groups," according to joint research published by Check Point Research  and Kaspersky today.  The Uyghurs are a Turkic ethnic minority group originating from Central and East Asia and are recognized as native to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwest China. At least since 2015, government authorities have placed the region under tight surveillance, putting hundreds of thousands into prisons and internment camps that the government calls "Vocational Education and Training Centers.

Cybercrime groups are distributing malicious PHP web shells disguised as a favicon to maintain remote access to the compromised servers and inject JavaScript skimmers into online shopping platforms with an aim to steal financial information from their users.  "These web shells known as Smilodon or Megalodon are used to dynamically load JavaScript skimming code via server-side requests into online stores," Malwarebytes Jérôme Segura&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday write-up. "This technique is interesting as most client-side security tools will not be able to detect or block the skimmer."  Injecting web skimmers on e-commerce websites to steal credit card details is a tried-and-tested modus operandi of Magecart, a consortium of different hacker groups who target online shopping cart systems. Also known as formjacking attacks, the skimmers take the form of JavaScript code that the operators stealthily insert into an e-commerce website, often on payment pages, with an intent to c

An adversary known for its&nbsp; watering hole attacks &nbsp;against government entities has been linked to a slew of newly detected intrusions targeting various organizations in Central Asia and the Middle East.  The malicious activity, collectively named "EmissarySoldier," has been attributed to a threat actor called LuckyMouse, and is said to have happened in 2020 with the goal of obtaining geopolitical insights in the region. The attacks involved deploying a toolkit dubbed SysUpdate  (aka Soldier) in a number of breached organizations, including government and diplomatic agencies, telecom providers, a TV media company, and a commercial bank.   LuckyMouse , also referred to as APT27 and Emissary Panda, is a sophisticated cyberespionage group that has a history of breaching multiple government networks in Central Asia and the Middle East.

Also called the DC Police, the MPD is the primary law enforcement agency for the District of Columbia in the U.S.   The ransomware gang has given the department three days to heed to their ransom demand or risk leaking sensitive files that could expose police informants to criminal gangs.

Security is only as strong as the weakest link. As further proof of this, Apple released an update to macOS operating systems to address an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability that could circumvent all security protections, thus permitting unapproved software to run on Macs.  The macOS flaw, identified as&nbsp; CVE-2021-30657 , was discovered and reported to Apple by security engineer Cedric Owens on March 25, 2021.  "An unsigned, unnotarized, script-based proof of concept application [...] could trivially and reliably sidestep all of macOS's relevant security mechanisms (File Quarantine, Gatekeeper, and Notarization Requirements), even on a fully patched M1 macOS system," security researcher Patrick Wardle&nbsp; explained &nbsp;in a write-up. "Armed with such a capability macOS malware authors could (and are) returning to their proven methods of targeting and infecting macOS users."   Apple's macOS comes with a feature called&nbsp; Gatekeeper , which allows only&nbsp; truste

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The sprawling&nbsp; SolarWinds cyberattack &nbsp;which came to light last December was known for its sophistication in the breadth of tactics used to infiltrate and persist in the target infrastructure, so much so that Microsoft went on to call the threat actor behind the campaign "skillful and methodic operators who follow operations security (OpSec) best practices to minimize traces, stay under the radar, and avoid detection."  But&nbsp; new research &nbsp;published today shows that the threat actor carefully planned each stage of the operation to "avoid creating the type of patterns that make tracking them simple," thus deliberately making forensic analysis difficult.  By analyzing telemetry data associated with previously published indicators of compromise, RiskIQ said it identified an additional set of 18 servers with high confidence that likely communicated with the targeted, secondary Cobalt Strike payloads delivered via the TEARDROP and RAINDROP malware, representing a 56% jum

If the Pulse Connect Secure gateway is part of your organization network, you need to be aware of a newly discovered critical zero-day authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2021-22893) that is currently being exploited in the wild and for which there is no patch yet.  At least two threat actors have been behind a series of intrusions targeting defense, government, and financial organizations in the U.S. and elsewhere by leveraging critical vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPN devices to circumvent multi-factor authentication protections and breach enterprise networks.  "A combination of prior vulnerabilities and a previously unknown vulnerability discovered in April 2021,&nbsp; CVE-2021-22893 , are responsible for the initial infection vector," cybersecurity firm FireEye&nbsp; said &nbsp;on Tuesday, identifying 12 malware families associated with the exploitation of Pulse Secure VPN appliances.

APKPure, one of the largest alternative app stores outside of the Google Play Store, was infected with malware this week, allowing threat actors to distribute Trojans to Android devices.  In an incident that's similar to that of German telecommunications&nbsp; equipment manufacturer Gigaset , the APKPure client version 3.17.18 is said to have been tampered with in an attempt to trick unsuspecting users into downloading and installing malicious applications linked to the malicious code built into the APKpure app.  The development was reported by researchers from&nbsp; Doctor Web &nbsp;and&nbsp; Kaspersky .   "This trojan belongs to the dangerous Android.Triada malware family capable of downloading, installing and uninstalling software without users' permission," Doctor Web researchers said.  According to Kaspersky, the APKPure version 3.17.18 was tweaked to incorporate an advertisement SDK that acts as a Trojan dropper designed to deliver other malware to a victim's device. "Thi

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hacking group related to a Chinese-speaking threat actor has been linked to an advanced cyberespionage campaign targeting government and military organizations in Vietnam.  The attacks have been attributed with low confidence to the advanced persistent threat (APT) called&nbsp; Cycldek &nbsp;(or Goblin Panda, Hellsing, APT 27, and Conimes), which is known for using spear-phishing techniques to compromise diplomatic targets in Southeast Asia, India, and the U.S. at least since 2013.  According to researchers from Kaspersky, the offensive, which was observed between June 2020 and January 2021, leverages a method called DLL side-loading to execute shellcode that decrypts a final payload dubbed " FoundCore ."   DLL side-loading &nbsp;has been a tried-and-tested technique used by various threat actors as an obfuscation tactic to bypass antivirus defenses. By loading malicious DLLs into legitimate executables, the idea is to mask their malicious activity under a trusted system or software proc

In an update shared on Wednesday, Google's Threat Analysis Group said the attackers behind the operation set up a fake security company called SecuriElite and a slew of social media accounts across Twitter and LinkedIn in an attempt to trick unsuspecting researchers into visiting the company's booby-trapped website "where a browser exploit was waiting to be triggered."  "The new website claims the company is an offensive security company located in Turkey that offers pentests, software security assessments and exploits," TAG's Adam Weidemann&nbsp; said . The website is said to have gone live on March 17.   A total of eight Twitter profiles and seven LinkedIn profiles, who claimed to be vulnerability researchers and human resources personnel at different security firms (inclu

Hackers are implanting multiple backdoors at industrial targets in Japan<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/hackers-are-implanting-multiple.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed details of a sophisticated campaign that deploys malicious backdoors for the purpose of exfiltrating information from a number of industry sectors located in Japan.  Dubbed "A41APT" by Kaspersky researchers, the findings delve into a new slew of attacks undertaken by&nbsp; APT10 &nbsp;(aka Stone Panda or Cicada) using previously undocumented malware to deliver as many as three payloads such as SodaMaster, P8RAT, and FYAnti.  The long-running intelligence-gathering operation first came into the scene in March 2019, with activities spotted as recently as November 2020, when&nbsp; reports &nbsp;emerged of Japan-linked companies being targeted by the threat actor in over 17 regions worldwide.   The fresh attacks uncovered by Kaspersky are said to have occurred in January 2021. The infection chain leverages a multi-stage attack process, with the initial intrusion happening via abuse of SSL-VPN by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities or stolen credential

"This group used various cyber espionage tactics to identify its targets and infect their devices with malware to enable surveillance."

It's not every day that one of the best-known independent cybersecurity individuals joins a cybersecurity company. The two are generally on opposite sides of the coin, with little crossover.  After all, they're usually concerned with different parts of the cybersecurity puzzle – one providing platforms and tools to defend organizations, the other keeping them accountable and looking for blind spots in even the best security tools.  That seems to be changing, however, with a recent appointment.  Cynet, an Autonomous XDR provider that recently closed a Series C funding round worth $40 million, announced that it has hired Chris Roberts as their Chief Security Strategist.  Roberts is world-renowned in counter-threat intelligence, as well as in vulnerability and threat research fields, thanks to decades of experience. As part of his efforts at Cynet, Roberts will be focusing his work on helping empower and connect security professionals from organizations outside of the Fortune 200

A malicious web shell deployed on Windows systems by leveraging a previously undisclosed zero-day in SolarWinds' Orion network monitoring software may have been the work of a possible Chinese threat group.  In a&nbsp; report &nbsp;published by Secureworks on Monday, the cybersecurity firm attributed the intrusions to a threat actor it calls Spiral.  Back on December 22, 2020, Microsoft&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;that a second espionage group may have been abusing the IT infrastructure provider's Orion software to drop a persistent backdoor called Supernova on target systems.  The findings were also corroborated by cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks'&nbsp; Unit 42 &nbsp;threat intelligence team and&nbsp; GuidePoint Security , both of whom described Supernova as a .NET web shell implemented by modifying an "app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll" module of the SolarWinds Orion application.

Earth Vetala is said to have leveraged spear-phishing emails containing embedded links to a popular file-sharing service called Onehub to distribute malware that ranged from password dumping utilities to custom backdoors, before initiating communications with a command-and-control (C2) server to exe

First documented in&nbsp; February 2020 , the malware has been linked to a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; Transparent Tribe &nbsp;(aka Operation C-Major, Mythic Leopard, or APT36), a highly prolific group allegedly of Pakistani origin known for its attacks against human rights activists in the country as well as military and government personnel in India.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Amid heightened&nbsp; border tensions &nbsp;between India and China, cybersecurity researchers have revealed a concerted campaign against India's critical infrastructure, including the nation's power grid, from Chinese state-sponsored groups.  The attacks, which coincided with the standoff between the two nations in May 2020, targeted a total of 12 organizations, 10 of which are in the power generation and transmission sector.  "10 distinct Indian power sector organizations, including four of the five Regional Load Despatch Centres (RLDC) responsible for operation of the power grid through balancing electricity supply and demand, have been identified as targets in a concerted campaign against India's critical infrastructure," Recorded Future&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published yesterday. "Other targets identified included 2 Indian seaports."   Chief among the victims include a power plant run by National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Limited and New Delhi-based Power

North Korean Hackers Targeting Defense Firms with ThreatNeedle Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/north-korean-hackers-targeting-defense.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A prolific North Korean state-sponsored hacking group has been tied to a new ongoing espionage campaign aimed at exfiltrating sensitive information from organizations in the defense industry.  Attributing the attacks with high confidence to the&nbsp; Lazarus Group , the new findings from Kaspersky signal an expansion of the APT actor's tactics by going beyond the usual gamut of financially-motivated crimes to fund the cash-strapped regime.&nbsp;  This broadening of its strategic interests happened in early 2020 by leveraging a tool called ThreatNeedle , researchers Vyacheslav Kopeytsev and Seongsu Park said in a Thursday write-up.  At a high level, the campaign leverages a multi-step approach that begins with a carefully crafted spear-phishing attack leading eventually to the attackers gaining remote control over the devices.   ThreatNeedle is delivered to targets via COVID-themed emails with malicious Microsoft Word attachments as initial infection vectors that, when opened, run a macro co

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ukraine is formally pointing fingers at Russian hackers for hacking into one of its government systems and attempting to plant and distribute malicious documents that would install malware on target systems of public authorities.  "The purpose of the attack was the mass contamination of information resources of public authorities, as this system is used for the circulation of documents in most public authorities," the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (NSDC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement published on Wednesday.   The NSDC's National Coordination Center for Cybersecurity (NCCC) termed it a supply chain attack aimed at the System of Electronic Interaction of Executive Bodies (SEI EB), which is used to distribute documents to officials.  Calling it a work of threat actors with ties to Russia, the NSDC said the malicious documents came embedded with a macro that, when opened, stealthily downloaded malicious code to control the compromised system remotely.

Hackers Exploit Accellion Zero-Days in Recent Data Theft and Extortion Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/hackers-exploit-accellion-zero-days-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Monday tied a&nbsp; string of attacks &nbsp;targeting Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) servers over the past two months to data theft and extortion campaign orchestrated by a cybercrime group called UNC2546 .  The attacks, which began in mid-December 2020, involved exploiting multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in the legacy FTA software to install a new web shell named DEWMODE on victim networks and exfiltrating sensitive data, which was then published on a data leak website operated by the CLOP ransomware gang.  But in a twist, no ransomware was actually deployed in any of the recent incidents that hit organizations in the U.S., Singapore, Canada, and the Netherlands, with the actors instead resorting to extortion emails to threaten victims into paying bitcoin ransoms.   According to&nbsp; Risky Business , some of the companies that have had their data listed on the site include Singapore's telecom provider&nbsp; SingTel , the American Bureau of Shipping, law firm

On August 13, 2016, a hacking unit calling itself " The Shadow Brokers " announced that it had stolen malware tools and exploits used by the Equation Group, a sophisticated threat actor believed to be affiliated to the Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit of the U.S.&nbsp; National Security Agency &nbsp;(NSA).  Although the group has since signed off following the unprecedented disclosures, new "conclusive" evidence unearthed by Check Point Research shows that this was not an isolated incident.  The previously undocumented cyber-theft took place more than two years before the Shadow Brokers episode, the American-Israeli cybersecurity company said in an exhaustive report published today, resulting in U.S.-developed cyber tools reaching the hands of a Chinese advanced persistent threat which then repurposed them in order to attack U.S. targets.

SolarWinds Hackers Stole Some Source Code for Microsoft Azure, Exchange, Intune<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/solarwinds-hackers-stole-some-source.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft, on Thursday, said it concluded its probe into the SolarWinds hack, finding that the attackers stole some source code but confirmed there's no evidence that they abused its internal systems to target other companies or gained access to production services or customer data.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new kind of Office malware distributed as part of a malicious email campaign that targeted more than 80 customers worldwide in an attempt to control victim machines and steal information remotely.  The tool — dubbed " APOMacroSploit " — is a macro exploit generator that allows the user to create an Excel document capable of bypassing antivirus software, Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), and even Gmail and other email-based phishing detection.  APOMacroSploit is believed to be the work of two French-based threat actors "Apocaliptique" and "Nitrix," who are estimated to have made at least $5000 in less than two months selling the product on HackForums.net.   About 40 hackers in total are said to be behind the operation, utilizing 100 different email senders in a slew of attacks targeting users in more than 30 different countries. The attacks were spotted for the first time at the end of November 2020, acco

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Russia-linked state-sponsored threat actor known as Sandworm has been linked to a three-year-long stealthy operation to hack targets by exploiting an IT monitoring tool called Centreon .  The intrusion campaign — which breached "several French entities" — is said to have started in late 2017 and lasted until 2020, with the attacks particularly impacting web-hosting providers, said the French information security agency ANSSI in an advisory.  "On compromised systems, ANSSI discovered the presence of a backdoor in the form of a webshell dropped on several Centreon servers exposed to the internet," the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;on Monday. "This backdoor was identified as being the PAS webshell, version number 3.1.4. On the same servers, ANSSI found another backdoor identical to one described by ESET and named Exaramel."  The Russian hacker group (also called APT28, TeleBots, Voodoo Bear, or Iron Viking) is said to be behind some of the most devastating cyberattacks in p

The flaw, which affects both physical and virtual SMA 100 10.x devices (SMA 200, SMA 210, SMA 400, SMA 410, SMA 500v), came to light after the NCC Group on Sunday&nbsp; alerted &nbsp;it had detected "indiscriminate use of an exploit in the wild."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Monday disclosed details about an ongoing campaign carried out by a government-backed threat actor from North Korea that has targeted security researchers working on vulnerability research and development.  The internet giant's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) said the adversary created a research blog and multiple profiles on various social media platforms such as Twitter, Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram, Discord, and Keybase in a bid to communicate with the researchers and build trust.  The goal, it appears, is to steal exploits developed by the researchers for possibly undisclosed vulnerabilities, thereby allowing them to stage further attacks on vulnerable targets of their choice.   "Their blog contains write-ups and analysis of vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed, including 'guest' posts from unwitting legitimate security researchers, likely in an attempt to build additional credibility with other security researchers,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;TAG researcher A

Microsoft on Wednesday shared more specifics about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted by the attackers behind the SolarWinds hack to stay under the radar and avoid detection, as cybersecurity companies work towards getting a "clearer picture" of one of the most sophisticated attacks in recent history.  Calling the threat actor "skillful and methodic operators who follow operations security (OpSec) best practices," the company said the attackers went out of their way to ensure that the initial backdoor ( Sunburst &nbsp;aka Solorigate) and the post-compromise implants ( Teardrop &nbsp;and&nbsp; Raindrop ) are separated as much as possible so as to hinder efforts to spot their malicious activity.  "The attackers behind Solorigate are skilled campaign operators who carefully planned and executed the attack, remaining elusive while maintaining persistence," researchers from Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new large-scale phishing campaign targeting global organizations has been found to bypass Microsoft Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) and steal credentials belonging to over a thousand corporate employees.  The cyber offensive is said to have originated in August last year, with the attacks aimed specifically at energy and construction companies, said researchers from Check Point Research today in a joint analysis in partnership with industrial cybersecurity firm Otorio.  Although phishing campaigns engineered for credential theft are among the most prevalent reasons for data breaches, what makes this operation stand out is an operational security failure that led to the attackers unintentionally exposing the credentials they had stolen to the public Internet.  "With a simple Google search, anyone could have found the password to one of the compromised, stolen email addresses: a gift to every opportunistic attacker," the researchers said .

SolarWinds Hackers Also Breached Malwarebytes Cybersecurity Firm<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/solarwinds-hackers-also-breached.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malwarebytes on Tuesday said it was breached by the same group who broke into SolarWinds to access some of its internal emails, making it the fourth major cybersecurity vendor to be targeted after&nbsp; FireEye ,&nbsp; Microsoft , and&nbsp; CrowdStrike .  The company said its intrusion was not the result of a SolarWinds compromise, but rather due to a separate initial access vector that works by "abusing applications with privileged access to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure environments."  The discovery was made after Microsoft notified Malwarebytes of suspicious activity from a dormant email protection app within its&nbsp; Office 365 tenant &nbsp;on December 15, following which it performed a detailed investigation into the incident.   "While Malwarebytes does not use SolarWinds, we, like many other companies were recently targeted by the same threat actor," the company's CEO Marcin Kleczynski&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A North Korean hacking group has been found deploying the RokRat Trojan  in a new spear-phishing campaign targeting the South Korean government.  Attributing the attack to&nbsp; APT37 &nbsp;(aka Starcruft, Ricochet Chollima, or Reaper), Malwarebytes said it identified a malicious document last December that, when opened, executes a macro in memory to install the aforementioned remote access tool (RAT).  "The file contains an embedded macro that uses a VBA self decoding technique to decode itself within the memory spaces of Microsoft Office without writing to the disk. It then embeds a variant of the RokRat into Notepad," the researchers&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in a Wednesday analysis.   Believed to be active at least since 2012, the&nbsp; Reaper APT &nbsp;is known for its focus on public and private entities primarily in South Korea, such as chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, and healthcare entities. Since then, their victimization has expanded beyond the Korean peninsula to include

Microsoft on Thursday revealed that the threat actors behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack were able to gain access to a small number of internal accounts and escalate access inside its internal network.

"We detected unusual activity with a small number of internal accounts and upon review, we discovered one account had been used to view source code in a number of source code repositories," the Windows maker&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in an update.  "The account did not have permissions to modify any code or engineering systems and our investigation further confirmed no changes were made. These accounts were investigated and remediated."

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New evidence amidst the ongoing probe into the&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;targeting SolarWinds has uncovered an unsuccessful attempt to compromise cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike and access the company's email.  The hacking endeavor was reported to the company by Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center on December 15, which identified a third-party reseller's Microsoft Azure account to be making "abnormal calls" to Microsoft cloud APIs during a 17-hour period several months ago.  The undisclosed affected reseller's Azure account handles Microsoft Office licensing for its Azure customers, including CrowdStrike.  Although there was an attempt by unidentified threat actors to read email, it was ultimately foiled as the firm does not use Microsoft's Office 365 email service, CrowdStrike&nbsp; said .   The incident comes in the wake of the&nbsp; supply chain attack &nbsp;of SolarWinds revealed earlier this month, resulting in the deployment of a covert backdoor (aka "Sunburst&amp;q

"The investigation of the whole SolarWinds compromise led to the discovery of an additional malware that also affects the SolarWinds Orion product but has been determined to be likely unrelated to this compromise and used by a different threat actor," Microsoft 365 research team&nbsp; said &nbsp;on Friday in a post detailing the Sunburst malware.  What makes the newly revealed malware, dubbed "Supernova," different is that unlike the Sunburst DLL,&nbsp; Supernova &nbsp;("app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll") is not signed with a legitimate SolarWinds digital certificate, signaling that the compromise may be unrelated to the previously disclosed supply chain attack.
