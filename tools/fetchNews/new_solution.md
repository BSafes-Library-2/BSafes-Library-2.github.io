  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple has introduced a Rapid Security Response feature  in iOS 16 and macOS Ventura that's designed to deploy security fixes without the need for a full operating system version update.  "macOS security gets even stronger with new tools that make the Mac more resistant to attack, including Rapid Security Response that works in between normal updates to easily keep security up to date without a reboot," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement on Monday.  The feature, which also works on iOS , aims to separate regular software updates from critical security improvements and are applied automatically so that users are quickly protected against in-the-wild attacks  and unexpected threats. It's worth noting that Apple tested an analogous option  in iOS 14.5.   Rapid Security Response, viewed in that light, mirrors a similar approach taken by Google through Play Services  and Play Protect  to secure Android devices from malware and other kinds of fraud.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the threat landscape evolves and multiplies with more advanced attacks than ever, defending against these modern cyber threats is a monumental challenge for almost any organization.&nbsp;  Threat detection is about an organization's ability to accurately identify threats, be it to the network, an endpoint, another asset or an application – including cloud infrastructure and assets. At scale, threat detection analyzes the entire security infrastructure to identify malicious activity that could compromise the ecosystem.  Countless solutions support threat detection, but the key is to have as much data as possible available to bolster your security visibility. If you don't know what is happening on your systems, threat detection is impossible.&nbsp;  Deploying the right security software is critical for protecting you from threats.  What do we mean by threat detection software?  In the early days of threat detection, software was deployed to protect against different forms of malware. However,

SIM-based Authentication Aims to Transform Device Binding Security to End Phishing<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/sim-based-authentication-aims-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Let's face it: we all use email, and we all use passwords. Passwords create inherent vulnerability in the system. The success rate of phishing attacks is&nbsp; skyrocketing , and opportunities for the attack have greatly multiplied as lives moved online. All it takes is one password to be compromised for all other users to become victims of a data breach.&nbsp;  To deliver additional security, therefore, digital identities rely on verification plasters. MFA (multi-factor authentication) often falls back to knowledge factors such as password resets and OTP codes, but these are still vulnerable. As long as credentials can be shared or intercepted, they can be misused.&nbsp;  What is needed is a paradigm shift – from knowledge-based credentials to strong possession-factor security that can't be compromised, alongside other verification security such as biometrics.  A new possession-factor API now aims to do precisely that, replacing knowledge-based credentials, by using the SIM card for possess

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Thursday&nbsp; announced &nbsp;the creation of a new "Open Source Maintenance Crew" to focus on bolstering the security of critical open source projects.  Additionally, the tech giant pointed out&nbsp; Open Source Insights &nbsp;as a tool for analyzing packages and their dependency graphs, using it to determine "whether a vulnerability in a dependency might affect your code."  "With this information, developers can understand how their software is put together and the consequences to changes in their dependencies," the company said.  The development comes as security and trust in the open source software ecosystem has been increasingly thrown into question in the aftermath of a&nbsp; string &nbsp;of&nbsp; supply chain &nbsp; attacks &nbsp;designed to compromise developer workflows.   In December 2021, a critical flaw in the ubiquitous open source&nbsp; Log4j logging library &nbsp;left several companies scrambling to patch their systems against potential abuse.

Google on Wednesday took to its annual developer conference to announce a host of privacy and security updates, including support for virtual credit cards on Android and Chrome.

Google to Add Passwordless Authentication Support to Android and Chrome<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/google-to-add-passwordless.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google today announced&nbsp; plans &nbsp;to implement support for passwordless logins in Android and the Chrome web browser to allow users to seamlessly and securely sign in across different devices and websites irrespective of the platform.  "This will simplify sign-ins across devices, websites, and applications no matter the platform — without the need for a single password," Google&nbsp; said .   Apple and Microsoft are also expected to extend the support to iOS, macOS, and Windows operating systems as well as Safari and Edge browsers.  The common Fast IDentity Online ( FIDO ) sign-in system does away with passwords entirely in favor of displaying a prompt asking a user to unlock the phone when signing into a website or an application.  This is made possible by storing a cryptographically-secured FIDO credential called a passkey on the phone that's used to log in to the online account after unlocking the device.

Use This Definitive RFP Template to Effectively Evaluate XDR solutions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/07/extended-detection-response.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new class of security tools is emerging that promises to significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of threat detection and response.   Emerging Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solutions aim to aggregate and correlate telemetry from multiple detection controls and then synthesize response actions.   XDR has been referred to as the next step in the evolution of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.   Because XDR represents a new solution category, there is no single accepted definition of what capabilities and features should (and shouldn't) be included.   Each provider approaches XDR with different strengths and perspectives on how what an XDR solution should include.   Therefore, selecting an XDR provider is quite challenging as organizations must organize and prioritize a wide range of capabilities that can differ significantly between providers.   Cynet is now addressing this need with the Definitive RFP Template for XDR solutions ( download here ),

Wazuh Offers XDR Functionality at a Price Enterprises Will Love — Free!<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/wazuh-offers-xdr-functionality-at-price.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Back in 2018, Palo Alto Networks CTO and co-founder Nir Zuk coined a new term to describe the way that businesses needed to approach cybersecurity in the years to come. That term, of course, was extended detection and response (XDR). It described a unified cybersecurity infrastructure that brought endpoint threat detection, network analysis and visibility (NAV), access management, and more under a single roof to find and neutralize digital threats in real-time.  And Zuk's vision of XDR proved prophetic. In the years since he coined the phrase, platforms leveraging the XDR model have emerged as the de-facto leaders of the business cybersecurity industry. But their scale and complexity put them in a product class that's just out of reach for some enterprises.  Fortunately, the open-source community — as it often does — has filled the XDR void with an affordable product — because it's totally free. It's called&nbsp; Wazuh , and it provides enterprises the tools they need to bu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For the last few years, the cybersecurity threat landscape has gotten progressively more complex and dangerous. The online world is now rife with data thieves, extortionists, and even state actors looking to exploit vulnerabilities in businesses' digital defenses.&nbsp;  And unfortunately — the bad guys have the upper hand at the moment. Part of the reason for that is the fallout from the rapid digitization made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic.  According to research on the subject,&nbsp; more than half of businesses &nbsp;have yet to mitigate the risks created by that digitization. And when you add a persistent shortage of cybersecurity workers to that fact, you have the makings of a scary situation.  But businesses aren't helpless. There are plenty of things they can do to augment their defenses as they look to mitigate cyber risks. And best of all, some of those options won't cost them a thing.

This New Tool Can Retrieve Pixelated Text from Redacted Documents<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/this-new-tool-can-retrieve-pixelated.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The practice of blurring out text using a method called pixelation  may not be as secure as previously thought.  While the most foolproof way of concealing sensitive textual information is to use opaque black bars, other redaction methods like pixelation can achieve the opposite effect, enabling the reversal of pixelized text back into its original form.  Dan Petro, a lead researcher at offensive security firm Bishop Fox, has&nbsp; demonstrated &nbsp;a new open-source tool called&nbsp; Unredacter &nbsp;to reconstruct text from the pixelated images, effectively leaking the very information that was meant to be protected.   The tool is also seen as an improvement over an existing utility named&nbsp; Depix , which works by looking up what permutations of pixels could have resulted in certain pixelated blocks to recover the text.   The threat model works on the underlying hypothesis that given a piece of text containing both redacted and un-redacted information, the attacker uses the information about the font si

A recent survey by IWG (the International Workplace Group) determined that 70% of the world's professionals work remotely at least one day a week, with 53% based outside their workplace at least half of the week.  Taking this into consideration, organizations have started looking for reliable partners that can deliver services and support consistently, for example, to install new hybrid infrastructure solutions while trusting them with the everyday functioning of their IT.  So far, MSPs have been meeting this demand by offering multiple solutions that help employees work remotely without any problems.  What are the main cybersecurity solutions remote workers need?   Multi-Factor Authentication  Virtual Private Network  DNS Filtering  to secure DNS traffic   Why is a web filtering important and what are the main features necessary for MSPs?

An accountant and a security expert walk into a bar… SOC2 is no joke.&nbsp;  Whether you're a publicly held or private company, you are probably considering going through a Service Organization Controls (SOC) audit. For publicly held companies, these reports are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and executed by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). However, customers often ask for SOC2 reports as part of their vendor due diligence process.&nbsp;  Out of the three types of SOC reports, SOC2 is the standard to successfully pass regulatory requirements and signals high security and resilience within the organization — and is based on the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) attestation requirements. The purpose of this report is to evaluate an organization's information systems relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy — over a period of time (roughly six to twelve months).&nbsp;  As part of a SOC2 audit, i

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We hear about the need for better visibility in the cybersecurity space – detecting threats earlier and more accurately. We often hear about the dwell time and the time to identify and contain a data breach. Many of us are familiar with IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report that has been tracking this statistic for years. In the 2021 report, IBM found that, on average, it takes an average of 212 days to identify a breach and then another 75 days to contain the breach, for a total of 287 days.  A new&nbsp; solution overview document &nbsp;provides insights on how XDR provider Cynet tackles the difficult problem of greatly improving threat visibility. Cynet takes a modern approach that includes a greater level of native technology integration and advanced automation purposely designed for organizations with smaller security teams than Fortune 500 organizations.

Researchers Use Natural Silk Fibers to Generate Secure Keys for Strong Authentication<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/researchers-use-natural-silk-fibers-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics at South Korea's Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) have utilized natural silk fibers from domesticated silkworms to build an environmentally friendly digital security system that they say is "practically unbreachable."  "The first natural physical unclonable function (PUF) […] takes advantage of the diffraction of light through natural microholes in native silk to create a secure and unique digital key for future security solutions," the researchers said .  Physical unclonable functions or&nbsp; PUFs &nbsp;refer to devices that leverage inherent randomness and microscopic differences in electronics introduced during manufacturing to generate a unique identifier (e.g., cryptographic keys) for a given set of inputs and conditions.   In other words, PUFs are non-algorithmic one-way functions derived from uncopiable elements to create unbreakable identifiers for strong authentication. Over the years, PUFs have been widely used in smartca

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
2021 was a year peppered by cyberattacks, with numerous data breaches happening. Not only that, but ransomware has also become a prominent player in the hackers' world.  Now, more than ever, it's important for enterprises to step up cybersecurity measures. They can do this through several pieces of technology, such as an open-source security platform like Wazuh .&nbsp;  Wazuh  is a free and open source security platform that unifies XDR and SIEM capabilities, which not only enables companies to detect sophisticated threats, but can also help immensely in preventing data breaches and leaks from happening. As a result, it can save businesses from costly fixes that can ultimately end in their closure.  It is also possible to integrate Wazuh with a number of external services and tools. Some of them are VirusTotal, YARA, Amazon Macie, Slack, and Fortigate Firewall. Consequently, companies can improve their security against hackers from penetrating their networks.  What's great abou

ZTNAs Address Requirements VPNs Cannot. Here's Why.<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/ztnas-address-requirements-vpns-cannot.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
I recently hopped on the&nbsp; Lookout podcast &nbsp;to talk about virtual private networks (VPNs) and how they've been extended beyond their original use case of connecting remote laptops to your corporate network. Even in this new world where people are using personal devices and cloud apps, VPN continues to be the go-to solution for remote access and cloud access. After my conversation with Hank Schless, I was inspired to put some additional thoughts about VPN on paper.  When most organizations were forced to shift to remote work last year, they needed a quick-fix solution that would enable their remote employees to access work resources securely. For many, this solution came in the form of VPNs. However, VPNs were not designed for the bring your own device (BYOD) and cloud app use cases.  While VPNs are able to provide remote access, it may come as a surprise that they fall short when it comes to security. This is because VPNs were built for when only a small portion of your workforce w

Google Chrome has announced plans to prohibit public websites from directly accessing endpoints located within private networks as part of an upcoming major security shakeup to prevent intrusions via the browser.  The proposed change is set to be rolled out in two phases consisting of releases Chrome 98 and Chrome 101 scheduled in the coming months via a newly implemented W3C specification called private network access ( PNA ).   "Chrome will start sending a&nbsp; CORS &nbsp;preflight request ahead of any private network request for a subresource, which asks for explicit permission from the target server," Titouan Rigoudy and Eiji Kitamura&nbsp; said . "This preflight request will carry a new header, Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true, and the response to it must carry a corresponding header, Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true."   What this means is that starting with Chrome version 101, any website accessible via the internet will be made to seek explicit permi

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity teams have many demands competing for limited resources. Restricted budgets are a problem, and restricted staff resources are also a bottleneck. There is also the need to maintain business continuity at all times. It's a frustrating mix of challenges – with resources behind tasks such as patching rarely sufficient to meet security prerogatives or compliance deadlines.  The multitude of different security-related standards have ever stringent deadlines, and it is often the case that business needs don't necessarily align with those requirements. At the core of what TuxCare does is automated live patching – a way to consistently keep critical services safe from security threats, without the need to expend significant resources in doing so, or the need to live with business disruption.  In this article, we'll outline how&nbsp; TuxCare &nbsp;helps organizations such as yours deal better with security challenges including patching, and the support of end-of-life operating s

It's almost as if the internet's tailor-made to enable scams and fraud.  And that's just what it does. Right now, the world's on track to &nbsp;lose $10.5 trillion every year &nbsp;to cybercrime. That number is so large that it's hard for the average person to grasp. And when most people hear it, they imagine that money's coming mostly from large-scale data breaches and ransomware attacks on large companies.  Although businesses are among the hardest hit each year, they're by no means the only target. Every day, internet users are targeted too.

Today's cyber attackers are constantly looking for ways to exploit vulnerabilities and infiltrate organizations. To keep up with this evolving threat landscape, security teams must be on the lookout for potential risks around the clock. Since most organizations simply cannot afford to have 24x7 security teams, managed detection and response (MDR) services have become a critical aspect of any modern security stack.&nbsp;  Most organizations must find outsourced MDR providers on top of their existing solutions, but that's not always a feasible solution. XDR provider Cynet offers its MDR service ( learn more here ), which the company calls CyOps, as part of its offering. The service is much more than simply a help desk, though.

The Apache Software Foundation has released fixes to contain an&nbsp; actively &nbsp; exploited &nbsp;zero-day vulnerability affecting the widely-used Apache Log4j Java-based logging library that could be weaponized to execute malicious code and allow a complete takeover of vulnerable systems.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-44228 &nbsp;and by the monikers Log4Shell or LogJam, the issue concerns a case of unauthenticated, remote code execution (RCE) on any application that uses the open-source utility and affects versions Log4j 2.0-beta9 up to 2.14.1. The bug has scored a perfect 10 on 10 in the CVSS rating system, indicative of the severity of the issue.  "An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from&nbsp; LDAP &nbsp;servers when message lookup substitution is enabled," the Apache Foundation&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "From Log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default."   Exploitation can be achieved by a single string of text, which c

Latest Firefox 95 Includes RLBox Sandboxing to Protect Browser from Malicious Code<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/latest-firefox-95-includes-rlbox.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mozilla is beginning to roll out Firefox 95 with a new sandboxing technology called RLBox that prevents untrusted code and other security vulnerabilities from causing "accidental defects as well as supply-chain attacks."  Dubbed " RLBox " and implemented in collaboration with researchers at the University of California San Diego and the University of Texas, the improved protection mechanism is designed to harden the web browser against potential weaknesses in off-the-shelf libraries used to render audio, video, fonts, images, and other content.   To that end, Mozilla is incorporating "fine-grained sandboxing" into five modules, including its&nbsp; Graphite &nbsp;font rendering engine,&nbsp; Hunspell &nbsp;spell checker,&nbsp; Ogg &nbsp;multimedia container format,&nbsp; Expat &nbsp;XML parser, and&nbsp; Woff2 &nbsp;web font compression format.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, on Thursday announced  an expansion of its Facebook Protect security program to include human rights defenders, activists, journalists, and government officials who are more likely to be targeted by bad actors across its social media platforms.  "These people are at the center of critical communities for public debate," said Nathaniel Gleicher, head of security policy at Meta. "They enable democratic elections, hold governments and organizations accountable, and defend human rights around the world. Unfortunately this also means that they are highly targeted by bad actors."   Facebook Protect , currently being launched globally in phases, enables users who enroll for the initiative to adopt stronger account security protections, like two-factor authentication (2FA), and watch out for potential hacking threats. Meta said more than 1.5 million accounts have enabled Facebook Protect to date, of which nearly 950,000 account

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For most organizations today, the logs produced by their security tools and environments provide a mixed bag. On the one hand, they can be a trove of valuable data on security breaches, vulnerabilities, attack patterns, and general security insights.  On the other, organizations don't have the right means to manage the massive scale of logs and data produced to derive any value from it.&nbsp;  Log management can quickly become a sore point, and either be forgotten or improperly managed if done manually.  In turn, this reduces data transparency and leaves organizations more exposed to vulnerabilities that could have been detected. A new centralized log management module (CLM) introduced by XDR provider Cynet ( learn more here ) could help organizations lighten that load and enhance organizations' visibility into their valuable log data.&nbsp;  Instead of manually handling the collection, storage, and parsing of data, organizations can use CLM to enhance their log analysis, better understand thei

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The average cost of a data breach, according to the latest research by IBM, now stands at&nbsp; USD 4.24 million , the highest reported. The leading cause? Compromised credentials, often caused by human error. Although these findings continue to show an upward trend in the wrong direction, the challenge itself is not new. What is new is the unprecedented and accelerated complexity of securing the workplace. CISOs/CIOs are dealing with legacy systems, cloud hosting, on-prem, remote workers, office based, traditional software, and SaaS.  How businesses adapted was laudable, but now that employees spread across locations, offices and homes – with&nbsp; more than half &nbsp;threatening not to return to offices unless hybrid working is implemented – the challenge morphs into securing a nonuniform perimeter.&nbsp;  We know passwords aren't sufficient. Knowledge-based access is usually fortified with other forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA), such as auth apps or FIDO tokens, and in highly sensitive case

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications have gone from novelty to business necessity in a few short years, and its positive impact on organizations is clear. It's safe to say that most industries today run on SaaS applications, which is undoubtedly positive, but it does introduce some critical new challenges to organizations.&nbsp;  As SaaS application use expands, as well as the number of touchpoints they create, the attack surface also becomes significantly larger.  As an answer to this emerging challenge, XDR provider Cynet has added a new SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) tool to its existing platform ( you can learn more here ). Regardless of the size of an organization or its security team, managing the security policy and posture of dozens to hundreds of SaaS applications is a complex task, and one that requires the right tools to expedite and optimize. Using SSPM can centralize many of the management and logistics requirements and offer a more unified way to establish secur

Google to turn on 2-factor authentication by default for 150 million users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/google-to-turns-on-2-factor.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has announced plans to automatically enroll about 150 million users into its two-factor authentication scheme by the end of the year as part of its ongoing efforts to prevent unauthorized access to accounts and improve security.  In addition, the internet giant said it also intends to require 2 million YouTube creators to switch on the setting, which it calls two-step verification (2SV), to protect their channels from potential takeover attacks.   "2SV is strongest when it combines both 'something you know' (like a password) and 'something you have' (like your phone or a security key)," Google's AbdelKarim Mardini and Guemmy Kim&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post, adding "having a second form of authentication dramatically decreases an attacker's chance of gaining access to an account."  The rollout follows the&nbsp; company's proposals &nbsp;to beef up account sign-ins earlier this May, when it said it intends to "automatically enrolling users in 2SV i

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Facebook on Wednesday announced it's open-sourcing&nbsp; Mariana Trench , an Android-focused static analysis platform the company uses to detect and prevent security and privacy bugs in applications created for the mobile operating system at scale.  "[Mariana Trench] is designed to be able to scan large mobile codebases and flag potential issues on&nbsp; pull requests &nbsp;before they make it into production," the Menlo Park-based social tech behemoth said .   In a nutshell, the utility allows developers to frame rules for different data flows to scan the codebase for in order to unearth potential issues — say,&nbsp; intent &nbsp; redirection &nbsp; flaws &nbsp;that could result in the leak of sensitive data or injection vulnerabilities that would allow adversaries to insert arbitrary code — explicitly setting boundaries as to where user-supplied data entering the app is allowed to come from (source) and flow into (sink) such as a database, file, web view, or a log.

How Cynet's Response Automation Helps Organizations Mitigate Cyber Threats<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/how-cynets-response-automation-helps.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
One of the determining factors of how much damage a cyber-attack cause is how fast organizations can respond to it. Time to response is critical for security teams, and it is a major hurdle for leaner teams.  To help improve this metric and enhance organizations' ability to respond to attacks quickly, many endpoint detection and response (EDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) vendors have started including some form of automation in their platforms to reduce the need for manual intervention.  XDR provider Cynet claims that they go beyond existing solutions when it comes to security automation. More than automating individual components, the Cynet 360 platform ( see a live demo here ) offers automation across every phase of incident response – from detection through remediation. The company uses a variety of tools and techniques to keep organizations safe and quickly respond to any emerging threat.

<details>

Microsoft on Wednesday announced a new passwordless mechanism that allows users to access their accounts without a password by using Microsoft Authenticator, Windows Hello, a security key, or a verification code sent via SMS or email.  The change is expected to be rolled out in the coming weeks.  "Except for auto-generated passwords that are nearly impossible to remember, we largely create our own passwords,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Vasu Jakkal, Microsoft's corporate vice president for Security, Compliance, and Identity. "But, given the vulnerability of passwords, requirements for them have gotten increasingly complex in recent years, including multiple symbols, numbers, case sensitivity, and disallowing previous passwords."   "Passwords are incredibly inconvenient to create, remember, and manage across all the accounts in our lives," Jakkal added.  Over the years, weak passwords have emerged as the entry point for a vast majority of attacks across enterprise and cons

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WhatsApp on Friday&nbsp; announced &nbsp;it will roll out support for end-to-end encrypted chat backups on the cloud for Android and iOS users, paving the way for storing information such as chat messages and photos in Apple iCloud or Google Drive in a cryptographically secure manner.  The feature, which will go live to all of its two billion users in the coming weeks, is expected to only work on the primary devices tied to their accounts, and not companion devices such as desktops or laptops that simply mirror the content of WhatsApp on the phones.  While the Facebook-owned messaging platform flipped the switch on end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for personal messages, calls, video chats, and media between senders and recipients&nbsp; as far back as April 2016 , the content — should a user opt to back up on the cloud to enable the transfer of chat history to a new device — wasn't subjected to the same security protections until now.

The work-from-anywhere economy has opened up the possibility for your human resources team to source the best talent from anywhere. To scale their operations, organizations are leveraging the cloud to accelerate essential HR functions such as recruiting, onboarding, evaluating, and more.  SAP is leading this HR transformation with its human capital management (HCM) solution, SAP SuccessFactors. Delivering HR solutions from the cloud enables employees and administrators to not only automate typical tasks, such as providing a report on employee attrition, but also allows them to complete these tasks from anywhere and on any device.  SuccessFactors makes it easy for employees to access what they need. But the wide range of sensitive employee data within SuccessFactors creates additional security and compliance challenges. Whether it's personal and financial information used for payroll or health information for benefits, you need the right cybersecurity to ensure that sensitive data,

Researchers Propose Machine Learning-based Bluetooth Authentication Scheme<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/researchers-propose-machine-learning.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics has proposed a machine learning approach that uses authentic interactions between devices in Bluetooth networks as a foundation to handle device-to-device authentication reliably.  Called " Verification of Interaction Authenticity " (aka VIA), the recurring authentication scheme aims to solve the problem of passive, continuous authentication and automatic deauthentication once two devices are paired with one another, which remain authenticated until an explicit deauthentication action is taken, or the authenticated session expires.  "Consider devices that pair via Bluetooth, which commonly follow the pattern of pair once, trust indefinitely. After two devices connect, those devices are bonded until a user explicitly removes the bond. This bond is likely to remain intact as long as the devices exist, or until they transfer ownership," Travis Peters, one of the co-authors of the study,&nbsp; said .

How Does MTA-STS Improve Your Email Security?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/how-does-mta-sts-improve-your-email.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP has easily exploitable security loopholes. Email routing protocols were designed in a time when cryptographic technology was at a nascent stage (e.g., the de-facto protocol for email transfer, SMTP, is nearly 40 years old now), and therefore security was not an important consideration.&nbsp;  As a result, in most email systems encryption is still opportunistic, which implies that if the opposite connection does not support TLS, it gets rolled back to an unencrypted one delivering messages in plaintext.&nbsp;  To mitigate SMTP security problems,&nbsp; MTA-STS &nbsp;(Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security) is the recommended email authentication standard. It enforces TLS in order to allow MTAs to send emails securely. This means that it will only allow mail from MTAs that support TLS encryption, and it will only allow mail to go to MX hosts that support TLS encryption.  In case an encrypted connection cannot be negotiated between communicating SMTP servers, the

Forget watercooler conspiracies or boardroom battles. There's a new war in the office. As companies nudge their staff to return to communal workspaces, many workers don't actually want to – more than 50 percent of employees would rather quit, according to&nbsp; research by EY .&nbsp;  While HR teams worry over the hearts and minds of staff, IT security professionals have a different battle plan to draft – how to make the new normal of the hybrid workplace secure.  The Trade-off Between Usability and Security  A company's biggest vulnerability continues to be its people. In a hybrid workplace, a Zero Trust strategy means ever-tightening security.&nbsp; The MFA a company chooses &nbsp;affects the difficulty of logging into email, dashboards, workflow tools, client documentation, and so on. Or, conversely, how porous access security is.&nbsp;  Now imagine this scenario. An employee opens a company portal, confirms a prompt on a company app on her phone, and that's it. She has been authenticated s

I'm sure you would agree that, in today's digital world, the majority of applications we work on require some type of credentials – to connect to a database with a username/password, to access computer programs via authorized tokens, or API keys to invoke services for authentication.  Credentials, or sometimes just referred to as 'Secrets,' are pieces of user or system-level confidential information that ought to be carefully protected and accessible to legitimate users only. We all know how important it is to keep these assets secure to prevent account misuse and breaches.&nbsp;  A reality check: How often do you make proactive efforts to protect these assets? Rarely, I'd say.&nbsp;  Among the worst mistakes a developer can make when it comes to application security is to accidentally commit confidential information publicly on the Internet. Surprisingly, secrets and credentials are accidentally leaked more often than you might expect, and there are intelligent tools that s

Facebook on Friday said it's extending end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for voice and video calls in Messenger, along with testing a new opt-in setting that will turn on end-to-end encryption for Instagram DMs.  "The content of your messages and calls in an end-to-end encrypted conversation is protected from the moment it leaves your device to the moment it reaches the receiver's device," Messenger's Ruth Kricheli&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post. "This means that nobody else, including Facebook, can see or listen to what's sent or said. Keep in mind, you can report an end-to-end encrypted message to us if something's wrong."  The social media behemoth said E2EE is becoming the industry standard for improved privacy and security.   It's worth noting that the company's flagship messaging service gained support for E2EE in text chats  in 2016, when it added a " secret conversation " option to its app, while communications on its sister platform What

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Zero Trust is increasingly being adopted as the best strategy to maintain application security and prevent data breaches. To help achieve progress on Zero Trust, there is now a new, easy way to implement continuous user verification by connecting directly to the authentication systems used by mobile operators – without the overhead of processing or storing user data.&nbsp;  Before we show you how it works and how to integrate it, let's start with the fundamental challenge.  Zero Trust and Authentication  The Zero Trust model of identity verification essentially means never trusting that a returning user is whom they claim to be, regardless of their location or previous successful attempts. Zero Trust is a strategic approach to access management that is vital for keeping out bad actors.&nbsp;  As the world moves to the cloud, with an increasingly distributed network of employees, partners, and clients, tighter auth journeys become even more important.&nbsp;  But with greater security comes greate

"Scorecards helps reduce the toil and manual effort required to continually evaluate changing packages when maintaining a project's supply chain."   Scorecards &nbsp;aims to automate analysis of the security posture of open source projects as well as use the security health metrics to proactively improve the security posture of other critical projects. To date, the tool has been scaled up to evaluate security criteria for over 50,000 open source projects.   Some of the new additions include checks for contributions from mali

New API Lets App Developers Authenticate Users via SIM Cards<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/new-api-lets-app-developers.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Online account creation poses a challenge for engineers and system architects: if you put up too many barriers, you risk turning away genuine users. Make it too easy, and you risk fraud or fake accounts.  The Problem with Identity Verification  The traditional model of online identity – username/email and password – has long outlived its usefulness. This is how multi-factor or two-factor authentication (MFA or 2FA) has come into play, to patch up vulnerabilities of the so-called knowledge-based model, usually by SMS passcode to verify possession of a mobile phone number.  The simplicity of SMS-based verification has taken apps by storm – it's the default option, as most users have a mobile phone. Yet bad actors have learned how to exploit this verification method, leading to the menace of&nbsp; SIM swap fraud , which is alarmingly easy to pull off and rising rapidly in incidents.  There's been no lack of effort in finding a more secure factor that is still universal. For example, b

Google Releases New Framework to Prevent Software Supply Chain Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/google-releases-new-framework-to.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As software supply chain attacks emerge as a point of concern in the wake of SolarWinds  and Codecov &nbsp;security incidents, Google is proposing a solution to ensure the integrity of software packages and prevent unauthorized modifications.&nbsp;  Called " Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts " (SLSA, and pronounced "salsa"), the end-to-end framework aims to secure the software development and deployment pipeline — i.e., the source ➞ build ➞ publish workflow — and&nbsp; mitigate threats &nbsp;that arise out of tampering with the source code, the build platform, and the artifact repository at every link in the chain.   Google said SLSA is inspired by the company's own internal enforcement mechanism called Binary Authorization for Borg , a set of auditing tools that verifies code provenance and implements code identity to ascertain that the deployed production software is properly reviewed and authorized.  "In its current state, SLSA is a set of incrementally adoptable

Mozilla Begins Rolling Out 'Site Isolation' Security Feature to Firefox Browser<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/mozilla-begins-rolling-out-site.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mozilla has begun rolling out a new security feature for its Firefox browser in nightly and beta channels that aims to protect users against a new class of side-channel attacks from malicious sites.  Called "Site Isolation," the implementation loads each website separately in its own operating system process and, as a result, prevents untrusted code from a rogue website from accessing confidential information stored in other sites.  "This fundamental redesign of Firefox's Security architecture extends current security mechanisms by creating operating system process-level boundaries for all sites loaded in Firefox for Desktop," Mozilla&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. "Isolating each site into a separate operating system process makes it even harder for malicious sites to read another site's secret or private data."   The motivation for Site Isolation can be traced all the way back to January 2018 when&nbsp; Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities &nbsp;were publicly dis

A Simple 1-Click Compromised Password Reset Feature Coming to Chrome Browser<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/a-simple-1-click-compromised-password.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday&nbsp; announced &nbsp;a new feature to its password manager that could be used to change a stolen password automatically with a single tap.  Automated password changes build on the tool's ability to&nbsp; check the safety &nbsp;of saved passwords. Thus when Chrome finds a password that may have been compromised as part of a data breach, it will prompt users with an alert containing a "Change Password" button, tapping which "Chrome will not only navigate to the site, but also go through the entire process of changing your password."   Enabling this in the background is Google's&nbsp; Duplex &nbsp;technology, which it debuted in 2018 and expanded in 2019 to support various functions in Google Assistant like booking a rental car, ordering food, and buying movie tickets. The search giant, however, noted that users could take over control at any point during the process and change the password manually.   The feature is currently being rolled out in Chrome for Android to al

Apple May Start Delivering Security Patches Separately From Other OS Updates<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/apple-may-start-delivering-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple may be changing the way it delivers security patches to its devices running iOS and iPadOS mobile operating systems.  According to code spotted in iOS 14.5, the iPhone maker is reportedly working on a method for delivering security fixes independently of other OS updates.  The changes were first reported by&nbsp; the 9to5Mac &nbsp;website.   While Google's Android has had monthly security patches rolled out that are completely divorced from the OS-related updates, iOS has no option to install a security update without upgrading to the latest version of the OS.  But with this new setting called "Install Security Updates" added to the software update menu, it's expected that Apple will let users choose between either installing the entire iOS update or just the security updates, in a manner that echoes macOS.  On Macs running older versions of the operating system such as macOS Mojave, Apple has offered standalone update packs, allowing users to get security patches and bu

Google uncovers new iOS security feature Apple quietly added after zero-day attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/google-uncovers-new-ios-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google Project Zero on Thursday disclosed details of a new security mechanism that Apple quietly added to iOS 14 as a countermeasure to prevent attacks that were recently found to leverage zero-days in its messaging app.  Dubbed " BlastDoor ," the improved sandbox system for iMessage data was disclosed by Samuel Groß, a security researcher with Project Zero, a team of security researchers at Google tasked with studying zero-day vulnerabilities in hardware and software systems.  "One of the major changes in iOS 14 is the introduction of a new, tightly sandboxed 'BlastDoor' service which is now responsible for almost all parsing of untrusted data in iMessages," Groß&nbsp; said . "Furthermore, this service is written in Swift, a (mostly) memory safe language which makes it significantly harder to introduce classic memory corruption vulnerabilities into the code base."   The development is a consequence of a&nbsp; zero-click exploit &nbsp;that leveraged an Apple iMe

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Creating workflows around verifying password resets can be challenging for organizations, especially since many have shifted work due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.  With the numbers of cyberattacks against businesses exploding and compromised credentials often being the culprit, companies have to bolster security around resetting passwords on user accounts.  How can organizations bolster the security of password resets for remote workers? One security workflow might involve having manager approval before IT helpdesk technicians can change a remote worker's password. In this way, the user's manager is involved in the process.  Additionally, some organizations might opt to allow managers themselves the ability to change end-user passwords. How can this be configured in Active Directory? Also, is there a more seamless solution for requiring manager approval for password resets?  Why password reset security is critical  This past year has undoubtedly created many IT helpdesk st
