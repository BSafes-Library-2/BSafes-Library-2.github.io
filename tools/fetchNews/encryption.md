  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of researchers has revealed what it says is a vulnerability in a specific implementation of&nbsp; CRYSTALS-Kyber , one of the encryption algorithms chosen by the U.S. government as quantum-resistant last year. The exploit relates to "side-channel attacks on up to the fifth-order masked implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber in ARM Cortex-M4 CPU," Elena Dubrova, Kalle Ngo, and Joel Gärtner of KTH Royal Institute of Technology&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a paper. CRYSTALS-Kyber is one of four post-quantum algorithms&nbsp; selected &nbsp;by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) after a rigorous multi-year effort to identify the next-generation encryption standards that can withstand huge leaps in computing power. A side-channel attack, as the name implies, involves extracting secrets from a cryptosystem through measurement and analysis of physical parameters. Some examples of such parameters include supply current, execution time, and electromagnetic emission. The underlying id

NIST Standardizes Ascon Cryptographic Algorithm for IoT and Other Lightweight Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/nist-standardizes-ascon-cryptographic.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has announced that a family of authenticated encryption and hashing algorithms known as Ascon will be standardized for&nbsp; lightweight cryptography &nbsp;applications. "The chosen algorithms are designed to protect information created and transmitted by the Internet of Things (IoT), including its myriad tiny sensors and actuators," NIST&nbsp; said . "They are also designed for other miniature technologies such as implanted medical devices, stress detectors inside roads and bridges, and keyless entry fobs for vehicles." Put differently, the idea is to adopt security protections via lightweight cryptography in devices that have a "limited amount of electronic resources." Ascon is&nbsp; credited &nbsp;to a team of cryptographers from the Graz University of Technology, Infineon Technologies, Lamarr Security Research, and Radboud University. The suite comprises authenticated ciphers ASCON-128, ASCON-128a, and a vari

Twitter chief executive Elon Musk confirmed plans for end-to-end encryption ( E2EE ) for direct messages on the platform.  The&nbsp; feature &nbsp;is part of Musk's vision for Twitter 2.0, which is expected to be what's called an "everything app." Other functionalities include longform tweets and payments, according to a slide deck shared by Musk over the weekend.   The company's plans for encrypted messages first came to light in mid-November 2022, when mobile researcher Jane Manchun Wong&nbsp; spotted &nbsp;source code changes in Twitter's Android app referencing conversation keys for E2EE chats.  It's worth noting that various other messaging platforms, such as Signal, Threema, WhatsApp, iMessage, Wire, Tox, and Keybase, already support encryption for messages.  Google, which previously turned on E2EE for&nbsp; one-to-one chats &nbsp;in its RCS-based Messages app for Android, is currently piloting the same option for group chats.

A late-stage candidate encryption algorithm that was meant to withstand decryption by powerful quantum computers in the future has been trivially cracked by using a computer running Intel Xeon CPU in an hour's time.  The algorithm in question is SIKE — short for Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation — which made it to the&nbsp; fourth round &nbsp;of the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process by the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  "Ran on a single core, the appended&nbsp; Magma &nbsp; code &nbsp;breaks the Microsoft&nbsp; SIKE challenges &nbsp;$IKEp182 and $IKEp217 in about 4 minutes and 6 minutes, respectively," KU Leuven researchers Wouter Castryck and Thomas Decru&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new paper.  "A run on the SIKEp434 parameters, previously believed to meet NIST's quantum security level 1, took about 62 minutes, again on a single core."   The code was executed on an Intel&nbsp; Xeon CPU E5-2630v2 &nbsp;at 2.60GHz, which was release

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has&nbsp; chosen &nbsp;the first set of quantum-resistant encryption algorithms that are designed to "withstand the assault of a future quantum computer."  The post-quantum cryptography ( PQC ) technologies include the&nbsp; CRYSTALS-Kyber &nbsp;algorithm for general encryption, and&nbsp; CRYSTALS-Dilithium ,&nbsp; FALCON , and&nbsp; SPHINCS+ &nbsp;for digital signatures.   "Three of the selected algorithms are based on a family of math problems called structured lattices, while SPHINCS+ uses hash functions," NIST, which kicked off the standardization process in January 2017,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement.  Cryptography, which underpins the security of information in modern computer networks, derives its strength from the difficulty of solving mathematical problems — e.g., factoring large composite integers — using traditional computers.

A group of academics from the North Carolina State University and Dokuz Eylul University have demonstrated what they say is the "first side-channel attack" on homomorphic encryption that could be exploited to leak data as the encryption process is underway.  "Basically, by monitoring power consumption in a device that is encoding data for homomorphic encryption, we are able to read the data as it is being encrypted," Aydin Aysu, one of the authors of the study,&nbsp; said . "This demonstrates that even next generation encryption technologies need protection against side-channel attacks."  Homomorphic Encryption is a&nbsp; form of encryption &nbsp;that allows certain types of computation to be performed directly on encrypted data without having to decrypt it in the first place.   It's also meant to be privacy-preserving in that it allows sharing of sensitive data with other third-party services, such as data analytics firms, for further processing while the underlyin

Google on Monday announced that it's rolling out client-side encryption to Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), thereby giving its enterprise customers direct control of encryption keys and the identity service they choose to access those keys.  "With client-side encryption, customer data is indecipherable to Google, while users can continue to take advantage of Google's native web-based collaboration, access content on mobile devices, and share encrypted files externally," the search giant&nbsp; said .&nbsp;  "When combined with our other encryption capabilities, customers can add new levels of data protection for their Google Workspace data."   The development coincides with the Google Workspace and Google Chat's&nbsp; broader availability to all users &nbsp;with a Google account. Workspace is the company's enterprise offering consisting of Gmail, Chat, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet, and other tools.   Businesses using Google Workspace have the choice o

Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007—and discovered it was a great target for street theft. The device was small and expensive, and it could easily be grabbed from someone’s hand. Apple worked to secure the phone, developing Find My iPhone. Thefts dropped. But criminals are nothing if not creative, and it soon became clear that street theft was the least of Apple’s security problems. Hackers in China used data from the devices to commit identity theft. And later the criminals started selling instructional videos to other criminals, showing how to do these hacks themselves.
