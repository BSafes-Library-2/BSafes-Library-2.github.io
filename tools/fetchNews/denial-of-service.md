  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity company Imperva has disclosed that it mitigated a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack with a total of over 25.3 billion requests on June 27, 2022.  The "strong attack," which targeted an unnamed Chinese telecommunications company, is said to have lasted for four hours and peaked at 3.9 million requests per second (RPS).  "Attackers used HTTP/2 multiplexing, or combining multiple packets into one, to send multiple requests at once over individual connections," Imperva&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published on September 19.  The attack was launched from a botnet that comprised nearly 170,000 different IP addresses spanning routers, security cameras, and compromised servers located in more than 180 countries, primarily the U.S., Indonesia, and Brazil.   The disclosure also comes as web infrastructure provider Akamai said it fielded a new DDoS assault aimed at a customer based in Eastern Europe on September 12, with attack traffic spiking at 704.8 million p

Google's cloud division on Thursday disclosed it mitigated a series of HTTPS distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks which peaked at 46 million requests per second (RPS), making it the largest such recorded to date.  The attack, which occurred on June 1, targeting an unnamed Google Cloud Armor customer, is 76% larger than the&nbsp; 26 million RPS DDoS attack &nbsp;repealed by Cloudflare earlier this June.   "To give a sense of the scale of the attack, that is like receiving all the daily requests to Wikipedia (one of the top 10 trafficked websites in the world) in just 10 seconds," Google Cloud's Emil Kiner and Satya Konduru&nbsp; said .  It's said to have started around 9:45 a.m. PT with 10,000 RPS, before growing to 100,000 RPS eight minutes later and further ramping up within two minutes to hit a high of 46 million RPS at 10:18 a.m. PT.

Cloudflare on Tuesday disclosed that it had acted to prevent a record-setting 26 million request per second (RPS) distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack last week, making it the largest HTTPS DDoS attack detected to date.  The web performance and security company said the attack was directed against an unnamed customer website using its Free plan and emanated from a "powerful" botnet of 5,067 devices, with each node generating approximately 5,200 RPS at peak.  The botnet is said to have created a flood of more than 212 million HTTPS requests within less than 30 seconds from over 1,500 networks in 121 countries, including Indonesia, the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India. Roughly 3% of the attack came through Tor nodes.

Hackers Begin Weaponizing TCP Middlebox Reflection for Amplified DDoS Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/hackers-begin-weaponizing-tcp-middlebox.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks leveraging a new amplification technique called TCP Middlebox Reflection  have been detected for the first time in the wild, six months after the novel attack mechanism was presented in theory.  "The attack […] abuses vulnerable firewalls and content filtering systems to reflect and amplify TCP traffic to a victim machine, creating a powerful DDoS attack," Akamai researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday.  "This type of attack dangerously lowers the bar for DDoS attacks, as the attacker needs as little as 1/75th (in some cases) the amount of bandwidth from a volumetric standpoint," the researchers added.   A distributed reflective denial-of-service ( DRDoS ) is a form of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that relies on publicly accessible UDP servers and bandwidth amplification factors (BAFs) to overwhelm a victim's system with a high volume of UDP responses.  In these attacks, the adversary sends a

An IRC &nbsp;(Internet Relay Chat) bot strain programmed in GoLang is being used to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks targeting users in Korea.  "The malware is being distributed under the guise of adult games," researchers from AhnLab's Security Emergency-response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published on Wednesday. "Additionally, the DDoS malware was installed via downloader and&nbsp; UDP RAT &nbsp;was used."   The attack works by uploading the malware-laced games to webhards, which refers to a web hard drive or a remote file hosting service, in the form of compressed ZIP archives that, when opened, includes an executable ("Game_Open.exe") that's orchestrated to run a malware payload aside from launching the actual game.   This payload, a GoLang-based downloader, establishes connections with a remote command-and-control (C&amp;C) server to retrieve additional malware, including an IRC bot that can perform DDoS attacks.

Microsoft Fended Off a Record 2.4 Tbps DDoS Attack Targeting Azure Customers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/microsoft-fended-off-record-24-tbps.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Monday revealed that its Azure cloud platform mitigated a 2.4 Tbps distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in the last week of August targeting an unnamed customer in Europe, surpassing a&nbsp; 2.3 Tbps attack &nbsp;stopped by Amazon Web Services in February 2020.  "This is 140 percent higher than&nbsp; 2020's 1 Tbps attack &nbsp;and higher than any network volumetric event previously detected on Azure," Amir Dahan, senior program manager for Azure Networking,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post, calling it a " UDP reflection " lasting for about 10 minutes.   Reflected amplification attacks are a type of denial of service attacks wherein a threat actor takes advantage of the connectionless nature of UDP protocol with spoofed requests so as to overwhelm a target server or network with a flood of packets, causing disruption or rendering the server and its surrounding infrastructure unavailable.   The attack is said to have originated from a botnet of approximately 70,000 compromised d

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Web infrastructure and website security company Cloudflare on Thursday disclosed that it mitigated the largest ever volumetric distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack recorded to date.  The attack, launched via a Mirai botnet, is said to have targeted an unnamed customer in the financial industry last month. "Within seconds, the botnet bombarded the Cloudflare edge with over 330 million attack requests," the company&nbsp; noted , at one point reaching a record high of 17.2 million requests-per-second (rps), making it three times bigger than previously reported HTTP DDoS attacks.   Volumetric DDoS attacks are designed to target a specific network with an intention to overwhelm its bandwidth capacity and often utilize&nbsp; reflective amplification techniques &nbsp;to scale their attack and cause as much operational disruption as possible.  They also typically originate from a network of malware-infected systems — consisting of computers, servers, and IoT devices — enabling threat actors

Weaknesses in the implementation of TCP protocol in&nbsp; middleboxes &nbsp;and censorship infrastructure could be weaponized as a vector to stage reflected denial of service (DoS) amplification attacks, surpassing many of the existing UDP-based amplification factors to date.  Detailed by a group of academics from the University of Maryland and the University of Colorado Boulder at the USENIX Security Symposium, the volumetric attacks take advantage of TCP-non-compliance in-network middleboxes — such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and deep packet inspection (DPI) boxes — to amplify network traffic, with hundreds of thousands of IP addresses offering&nbsp; amplification factors &nbsp;exceeding those from DNS, NTP, and Memcached.   Reflected amplification attacks are a type of DoS attacks in which an adversary leverages the connectionless nature of UDP protocol with spoofed requests to misconfigured open servers in order to overwhelm a target server or network with a flood of packets, causing

Beware: New Matryosh DDoS Botnet Targeting Android-Based Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/beware-new-matryosh-ddos-botnet.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A nascent malware campaign has been spotted co-opting Android devices into a botnet with the primary purpose of carrying out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.  Called " Matryosh " by Qihoo 360's Netlab researchers, the latest threat has been found reusing the Mirai botnet framework and propagates through exposed Android Debug Bridge (ADB) interfaces to infect Android devices and ensnare them into its network.  ADB is a&nbsp; command-line tool &nbsp;part of the Android SDK that handles communications and allows developers to install and debug apps on Android devices.  While this option is turned off by default on most Android smartphones and tablets, some vendors ship with this feature enabled, thus allowing unauthenticated attackers to connect remotely via the 5555 TCP port and open the devices directly to exploitation.   This is not the first time a botnet has taken advantage of ADB to infect vulnerable devices.  In July 2018, open ADB ports were used to spread multip
