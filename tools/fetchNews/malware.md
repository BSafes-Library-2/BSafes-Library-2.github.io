Apple macOS users are the target of a new Rust-based backdoor that has been operating under the radar since November 2023.

The operators of&nbsp; Raspberry Robin &nbsp;are now using two new one-day exploits to achieve local privilege escalation, even as the malware continues to be refined and improved to make it stealthier than before. This means that "Raspberry Robin has access to an exploit seller or its authors develop the exploits themselves in a short period of time," Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report this week. Raspberry Robin (aka QNAP worm), first documented in 2021, is an&nbsp; evasive malware family &nbsp;that's known to act as one of the&nbsp; top initial access facilitators &nbsp;for other malicious payloads, including ransomware. Attributed to a threat actor named Storm-0856 (previously DEV-0856), it's propagated via several entry vectors, including infected USB drives, with Microsoft&nbsp; describing &nbsp;it as part of a "complex and interconnected malware ecosystem" with ties to other e-crime groups like&nbsp; Evil Corp, Silence, and TA505 .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat hunters have identified a new variant of Android malware called&nbsp; MoqHao &nbsp;that automatically executes on infected devices without requiring any user interaction. "Typical MoqHao requires users to install and launch the app to get their desired purpose, but this new variant requires no execution," McAfee Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. "While the app is installed, their malicious activity starts automatically." The campaign's targets include Android users located in France, Germany, India, Japan, and South Korea. MoqHao, also called Wroba and XLoader (not to be confused with the&nbsp; Windows and macOS malware &nbsp;of the same name), is an Android-based mobile threat that's associated with a Chinese financially motivated cluster dubbed&nbsp; Roaming Mantis &nbsp;(aka Shaoye). Typical&nbsp; attack chains &nbsp;commence with package delivery-themed SMS messages bearing fraudulent links that, when clicked from Android devices, lead to the deployment of the malware b

New Coyote Trojan Targets 61 Brazilian Banks with Nim-Powered Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/new-coyote-trojan-targets-61-brazilian.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Sixty-one banking institutions, all of them originating from Brazil, are the target of a new banking trojan called&nbsp; Coyote . "This malware utilizes the Squirrel installer for distribution, leveraging Node.js and a relatively new multi-platform programming language called Nim as a loader to complete its infection," Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday report. What makes Coyote a different breed from&nbsp; other banking trojans &nbsp;of its kind is the use of the open-source&nbsp; Squirrel framework &nbsp;for installing and updating Windows apps. Another notable departure is the shift from Delphi – which is prevalent among banking malware families targeting Latin America – to an uncommon programming language like Nim. In the attack chain documented by Kaspersky, a Squirrel installer executable is used as a launchpad for a Node.js application compiled with Electron, which, in turn, runs a Nim-based loader to trigger the execution of the malicious Coyote payload by means of

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors behind a loader malware called&nbsp; HijackLoader &nbsp;have added new techniques for defense evasion, as the malware continues to be increasingly used by other threat actors to deliver additional payloads and tooling. "The malware developer used a standard process hollowing technique coupled with an additional trigger that was activated by the parent process writing to a pipe," CrowdStrike researchers Donato Onofri and Emanuele Calvelli&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday analysis. "This new approach has the potential to make defense evasion stealthier." HijackLoader was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Zscaler ThreatLabz in September 2023 as having been used as a conduit to deliver DanaBot, SystemBC, and RedLine Stealer. It's also known to share a high degree of similarity with another loader known as IDAT Loader. Both the loaders are assessed to be operated by the same cybercrime group.

The North Korea-linked nation-state actor known as Kimsuky is suspected of using a previously undocumented Golang-based information stealer called&nbsp; Troll Stealer . The malware steals "SSH, FileZilla, C drive files/directories, browsers, system information, [and] screen captures" from infected systems, South Korean cybersecurity company S2W&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new technical report. Troll Stealer's links to Kimsuky stem from its similarities to known malware families, such as AppleSeed and AlphaSeed malware that have been attributed to the group. Kimsuky, also tracked under the names APT43, ARCHIPELAGO, Black Banshee, Emerald Sleet (previously Thallium), Nickel Kimball, and Velvet Chollima, is well known for its propensity to steal sensitive, confidential information in offensive cyber operations. In late November 2023, the threat actors were&nbsp; sanctioned &nbsp;by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for gathering intelligence to further North

The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has warned that more than 2,000 computers in the country have been infected by a strain of malware called DirtyMoe. The agency&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the campaign to a threat actor it calls&nbsp; UAC-0027 . DirtyMoe , active since at least 2016, is capable of carrying out cryptojacking and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In March 2022, cybersecurity firm Avast revealed the malware's ability to propagate in a worm-like fashion by taking advantage of known security flaws. The DDoS botnet is known to be delivered by means of another malware referred to as&nbsp; Purple Fox &nbsp;or via bogus MSI installer packages for popular software such as Telegram. Purple Fox is also&nbsp; equipped with a rootkit &nbsp;that allows the threat actors to&nbsp; hide the malware &nbsp;on the machine and make it difficult to detect and remove.

Vulnerable Docker services are being targeted by a novel campaign in which the threat actors are deploying XMRig cryptocurrency miner as well as the 9Hits Viewer software as part of a multi-pronged monetization strategy. "This is the first documented case of malware deploying the 9Hits application as a payload," cloud security firm Cado said , adding the development is a sign that adversaries are always on the lookout for diversifying their strategies to make money off compromised hosts. 9Hits advertises itself as a "unique web traffic solution" and an "automatic traffic exchange" that allows members of the service to drive traffic to their sites in exchange for purchasing credits. This is accomplished by means of a software called 9Hits Viewer, which runs a headless Chrome browser instance to visit websites requested by other members, for which they earn credits to pay for generating traffic to their sites. The exact method used to spread the malwa

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The remote access trojan (RAT) known as Remcos RAT has been found being propagated via webhards by disguising it as adult-themed games in South Korea. WebHard, short for&nbsp; web hard drive , is a popular online file storage system used to upload, download, and share files in the country. While webhards have been used in the past to deliver&nbsp; njRAT ,&nbsp; UDP RAT, and DDoS botnet malware , the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center's (ASEC) latest analysis shows that the technique has been adopted to distribute Remcos RAT. In these attacks, users are tricked into opening booby-trapped files by passing them off as adult games, which, when launched, execute malicious Visual Basic scripts in order to run an intermediate binary named "ffmpeg.exe." This results in the retrieval of Remcos RAT from an actor-controlled server. A sophisticated RAT, Remcos (aka Remote Control and Surveillance) facilitates unauthorized remote control and surveillance of compromised hosts, enablin

A new Python-based hacking tool called&nbsp; FBot &nbsp;has been uncovered targeting web servers, cloud services, content management systems (CMS), and SaaS platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft 365, PayPal, Sendgrid, and Twilio. "Key features include credential harvesting for spamming attacks, AWS account hijacking tools, and functions to enable attacks against PayPal and various SaaS accounts," SentinelOne security researcher Alex Delamotte&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. FBot is the latest addition to the list of cloud hacking tools like&nbsp; AlienFox, GreenBot &nbsp;(aka Maintance),&nbsp; Legion , and&nbsp; Predator , the latter four of which share code-level overlaps with AndroxGh0st. SentinelOne described FBot as "related but distinct from these families," owing to the fact that it does not reference any source code from AndroxGh0st, although it exhibits similarities with Legion, which first came to light last year.

Cybersecurity researchers have identified an updated version of a macOS information stealer called&nbsp; Atomic &nbsp;(or AMOS), indicating that the threat actors behind the malware are actively enhancing its capabilities. "It looks like Atomic Stealer was updated around mid to late December 2023, where its developers introduced payload encryption in an effort to bypass detection rules," Malwarebytes' Jérôme Segura&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report. Atomic Stealer&nbsp; first emerged &nbsp;in April 2023 for a monthly subscription of $1,000. It's capable of harvesting sensitive information from a compromised host, including Keychain passwords, session cookies, files, crypto wallets, system metadata, and the machine's password via a fake prompt. Over the past several months, the malware has been observed propagated via&nbsp; malvertising &nbsp;and&nbsp; compromised sites &nbsp;under the guise of legitimate software and web browser updates.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new Apple macOS backdoor called&nbsp; SpectralBlur &nbsp;that overlaps with a known malware family that has been attributed to North Korean threat actors. "SpectralBlur is a moderately capable backdoor that can upload/download files, run a shell, update its configuration, delete files, hibernate, or sleep, based on commands issued from the [command-and-control server]," security researcher Greg Lesnewich&nbsp; said . The malware shares similarities with&nbsp; KANDYKORN &nbsp;(aka SockRacket), an advanced implant that functions as a remote access trojan capable of taking control of a compromised host. It's worth noting that the KANDYKORN activity also intersects with another campaign orchestrated by the Lazarus sub-group known as BlueNoroff (aka TA444) which culminates in the deployment of a backdoor referred to as&nbsp; RustBucket &nbsp;and a late-stage payload dubbed&nbsp; ObjCShellz .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Three new malicious packages have been discovered in the Python Package Index (PyPI) open-source repository with capabilities to deploy a cryptocurrency miner on affected Linux devices. The three harmful packages, named modularseven, driftme, and catme, attracted a total of 431 downloads over the past month before they were taken down. "These packages, upon initial use, deploy a CoinMiner executable on Linux devices," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Gabby Xiong&nbsp; said , adding the campaign shares overlaps with a&nbsp; prior campaign &nbsp;that involved the use of a package called culturestreak to deploy a crypto miner. The malicious code resides in the __init__.py file, which decodes and retrieves the first stage from a remote server, a shell script ("unmi.sh") that fetches a configuration file for the mining activity as well as the CoinMiner file&nbsp; hosted on GitLab .

Information stealing malware are actively taking advantage of an undocumented Google OAuth endpoint named MultiLogin to hijack user sessions and allow continuous access to Google services even after a password reset. According to CloudSEK, the&nbsp; critical exploit &nbsp;facilitates session persistence and cookie generation, enabling threat actors to maintain access to a valid session in an unauthorized manner. The technique was first revealed by a threat actor named PRISMA on October 20, 2023, on their Telegram channel. It has since been&nbsp; incorporated &nbsp;into&nbsp; various malware-as-a-service (MaaS) stealer families , such as Lumma, Rhadamanthys, Stealc, Meduza, RisePro, and WhiteSnake. The MultiLogin authentication endpoint is primarily designed for synchronizing Google accounts across services when users sign in to their accounts in the Chrome web browser (i.e.,&nbsp; profiles ).&nbsp; A reverse engineering of the Lumma Stealer code has revealed that the technique targets the "Chrome's token_

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have detailed a new variant of a dynamic link library ( DLL ) search order hijacking technique that could be used by threat actors to bypass security mechanisms and achieve execution of malicious code on systems running Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows 11. The approach "leverages executables commonly found in the trusted WinSxS folder and exploits them via the classic DLL search order hijacking technique," cybersecurity firm Security Joes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report exclusively shared with The Hacker News. In doing so, it allows adversaries to eliminate the need for elevated privileges when attempting to run nefarious code on a compromised machine as well as introduce potentially vulnerable binaries into the attack chain, as&nbsp; observed &nbsp; in the &nbsp; past . DLL search order hijacking , as the name implies, involves&nbsp; gaming the search order &nbsp;used to load DLLs in order to execute malicious payloads for purposes of defense evasion, persistence, and privilege escal

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new piece of JavaScript malware has been observed attempting to steal users' online banking account credentials as part of a campaign that has targeted more than 40 financial institutions across the world. The activity cluster, which employs JavaScript web injections, is estimated to have led to at least 50,000 infected user sessions spanning North America, South America, Europe, and Japan. IBM Security Trusteer said it detected the campaign in March 2023. "Threat actors' intention with the web injection module is likely to compromise popular banking applications and, once the malware is installed, intercept the users' credentials in order to then access and likely monetize their banking information," security researcher Tal Langus&nbsp; said . Attack chains are characterized by the use of scripts loaded from the threat actor-controlled server ("jscdnpack[.]com"), specifically targeting a page structure that's common to several banks. It's susp

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Go-based information stealer malware called&nbsp; JaskaGO &nbsp;has emerged as the latest cross-platform threat to infiltrate both Windows and Apple macOS systems. AT&amp;T Alien Labs, which made the discovery,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the malware is "equipped with an extensive array of commands from its command-and-control (C&amp;C) server." Artifacts designed for macOS were first observed in July 2023, impersonating installers for legitimate software such as CapCut. Other variants of the malware have masqueraded as AnyConnect and security tools.&nbsp; Upon installation, JaskaGO runs checks to determine if it is executing within a virtual machine (VM) environment, and if so, executes a harmless task like pinging Google or printing a random number in a likely effort to fly under the radar. In other scenarios, JaskaGO proceeds to harvest information from the victim system and establishes a connection to its C&amp;C for receiving further instructions, including executing shell commands, enumerating

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The developers of the information stealer malware known as&nbsp; Rhadamanthys &nbsp;are actively iterating on its features, broadening its information-gathering capabilities and also incorporating a plugin system to make it more customizable. This approach not only transforms it into a threat capable of delivering "specific distributor needs," but also makes it more potent, Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical deepdive published last week. Rhadamanthys,&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by ThreatMon in October 2022, has been sold under the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model as early as September 2022 by an actor under the alias "kingcrete2022." Typically distributed through malicious websites mirroring those of genuine software that are advertised through Google ads, the malware is capable of harvesting a wide range of sensitive information from compromised hosts, including from web browsers, crypto wallets, email clients, VPN, and instant messaging apps.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new wave of phishing messages distributing the&nbsp; QakBot &nbsp;malware has been observed, more than three months after a law enforcement effort saw its infrastructure dismantled by infiltrating its command-and-control (C2) network. Microsoft, which made the discovery, described it as a low-volume campaign that began on December 11, 2023, and targeted the hospitality industry. "Targets received a PDF from a user masquerading as an IRS employee," the tech giant&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of posts shared on X (formerly Twitter). "The PDF contained a URL that downloads a digitally signed Windows Installer (.msi). Executing the MSI led to Qakbot being invoked using export 'hvsi' execution of an embedded DLL." Microsoft said that the payload was generated the same day the campaign started and that it's configured with the previously unseen version 0x500. Zscaler ThreatLabz, in a post shared on X, described the resurfaced QakBot as a 64-bit binary that utilizes AES

A novel multi-platform threat called&nbsp; NKAbuse &nbsp;has been discovered using a decentralized, peer-to-peer network connectivity protocol known as&nbsp; NKN &nbsp;(short for New Kind of Network) as a communications channel. "The malware utilizes NKN technology for data exchange between peers, functioning as a potent implant, and equipped with both flooder and backdoor capabilities," Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday report. NKN, which has over 62,000 nodes, is&nbsp; described &nbsp;as a "software overlay network built on top of today's Internet that enables users to share unused bandwidth and earn token rewards." It incorporates a blockchain layer on top of the existing TCP/IP stack. While threat actors are known to take advantage of emerging communication protocols for command-and-control (C2) purposes and evade detection, NKAbuse leverages blockchain technology to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and function as an implant inside com

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have identified a set of 116 malicious packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that are designed to infect Windows and Linux systems with a custom backdoor. "In some cases, the final payload is a variant of the infamous&nbsp; W4SP Stealer , or a simple clipboard monitor to steal cryptocurrency, or both," ESET researchers Marc-Etienne M.Léveillé and Rene Holt&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published earlier this week. The&nbsp; packages &nbsp;are estimated to have been downloaded over 10,000 times since May 2023. The threat actors behind the activity have been observed using three techniques to bundle malicious code into Python packages, namely via a test.py script, embedding PowerShell in setup.py file, and incorporating it in obfuscated form in the&nbsp; __init__.py file . Irrespective of the method used, the end goal of the campaign is to compromise the targeted host with malware, primarily a backdoor capable of remote command execution, data exfiltration, an

A pro-Hamas threat actor known as&nbsp; Gaza Cyber Gang &nbsp;is targeting Palestinian entities using an updated version of a backdoor dubbed Pierogi. The findings come from SentinelOne, which has given the malware the name Pierogi++ owing to the fact that it's implemented in the C++ programming language unlike its Delphi- and Pascal-based predecessor. "Recent Gaza Cybergang activities show consistent targeting of Palestinian entities, with no observed significant changes in dynamics since the start of the Israel-Hamas war," security researcher Aleksandar Milenkoski&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. Gaza Cyber Gang, believed to be&nbsp; active since at least &nbsp;2012, has a history of striking targets throughout the Middle East, particularly Israel and Palestine, often leveraging spear-phishing as a method of initial access.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new collection of eight process injection techniques, collectively dubbed&nbsp; PoolParty , could be exploited to achieve code execution in Windows systems while evading endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems. SafeBreach researcher Alon Leviev&nbsp; said &nbsp;the methods are "capable of working across all processes without any limitations, making them more flexible than existing process injection techniques." The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;were first presented at the&nbsp; Black Hat Europe 2023 &nbsp;conference last week. Process injection refers to an&nbsp; evasion technique &nbsp;used to run arbitrary code in a target process. A wide range of process injection techniques exists, such as dynamic link library (DLL) injection, portable executable injection, thread execution hijacking, process hollowing, and process doppelgänging. PoolParty is so named because it's rooted in a component called Windows user-mode thread pool, leveraging it to insert any type of work item into a target process on the system. I

"ZPAQ is a file compression format that offers a better compression ratio and journaling function compared to widely used formats like ZIP and RAR," G Data malware analyst Anna Lvova&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday analysis. "That means that ZPAQ archives can be smaller, saving storage space and bandwidth when transferring files. However, ZPAQ has the biggest disadvantage: limited software support." First appearing in 2014, Agent Tesla is a&nbsp; keylogger &nbsp;and&nbsp; remote access trojan &nbsp;(RAT) written in .NET that's&nbsp; offered &nbsp;to other threat actors as part of a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model. It's often used as a first-stage payload, providing remote access to a compromised system and utilized to download more sophisticated second-stage tools such as ransomware. Agent Tesla is typ

LummaC2 Malware Deploys New Trigonometry-Based Anti-Sandbox Technique<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/lummac2-malware-deploys-new.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The stealer malware known as&nbsp; LummaC2 &nbsp;(aka Lumma Stealer) now features a new anti-sandbox technique that leverages the mathematical principle of trigonometry to evade detection and exfiltrate valuable information from infected hosts. The method is designed to "delay detonation of the sample until human mouse activity is detected," Outpost24 security researcher Alberto Marín&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report shared with The Hacker News. Written in the C programming language, LummaC2 has been sold in underground forums since December 2022. The malware has since&nbsp; received &nbsp; iterative updates &nbsp;that make it harder to analyze via control flow flattening and even allow it to deliver additional payloads. The current version of LummaC2 (v4.0) also requires its customers to use a&nbsp; crypter &nbsp;as an added concealing mechanism, not to mention prevent it from being leaked in its raw form. Another noteworthy update is the reliance on trigonometry to detect human behavior on the infiltrated

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been observed publishing typosquat packages to the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository for nearly six months with an aim to deliver malware capable of gaining persistence, stealing sensitive data, and accessing cryptocurrency wallets for financial gain. The 27 packages, which masqueraded as popular legitimate Python libraries, attracted thousands of downloads, Checkmarx said in a new report. A majority of the downloads originated from the U.S., China, France, Hong Kong, Germany, Russia, Ireland, Singapore, the U.K., and Japan. "A defining characteristic of this attack was the utilization of steganography to hide a malicious payload within an innocent-looking image file, which increased the stealthiness of the attack," the software supply chain security firm&nbsp; said . Some of the packages are pyefflorer, pyminor, pyowler, pystallerer, pystob, and pywool, the last of which was planted on May 13, 2023. A common denominator to these packages is t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have demonstrated a new technique that exploits a critical security flaw in Apache ActiveMQ to achieve arbitrary code execution in memory. Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-46604 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 10.0), the vulnerability is a remote code execution bug that could permit a threat actor to run arbitrary shell commands. It was patched by Apache in ActiveMQ versions 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, or 5.18.3 released late last month. The vulnerability has since&nbsp; come under &nbsp; active exploitation &nbsp;by ransomware outfits to deploy ransomware such as HelloKitty and a strain that shares similarities with TellYouThePass as well as a remote access trojan called SparkRAT. According to&nbsp; new findings &nbsp;from VulnCheck, threat actors weaponizing the flaw are&nbsp; relying &nbsp;on a public proof-of-concept ( PoC ) exploit originally disclosed on October 25, 2023. The attacks have been found to use&nbsp; ClassPathXmlApplicationContext , a class that's part of the Spring framework and available within Active

Cybersecurity researchers have warned about a Windows version of a wiper malware that was previously observed targeting Linux systems in cyber attacks aimed at Israel. Dubbed&nbsp; BiBi-Windows Wiper &nbsp;by BlackBerry, the wiper is the Windows counterpart of&nbsp; BiBi-Linux Wiper , which has been put to use by a pro-Hamas hacktivist group in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war last month. "The Windows variant [...] confirms that the threat actors who created the wiper are continuing to build out the malware, and indicates an expansion of the attack to target end user machines and application servers," the Canadian company&nbsp; said &nbsp;Friday. Slovak cybersecurity firm is&nbsp; tracking &nbsp;the actor behind the wiper under the name BiBiGun, noting that the Windows variant (bibi.exe) is designed to overwrite data in the C:\Users directory recursively with junk data and appends .BiBi to the filename.

A new&nbsp; malvertising campaign &nbsp;has been found to employ fake sites that masquerade as legitimate Windows news portal to propagate a malicious installer for a popular system profiling tool called CPU-Z. "This incident is a part of a larger malvertising campaign that targets other utilities like Notepad++, Citrix, and VNC Viewer as seen in its infrastructure (domain names) and cloaking templates used to avoid detection," Malwarebytes' Jérôme Segura&nbsp; said . While malvertising campaigns are known to set up replica sites advertising widely-used software, the latest activity marks a deviation in that the website mimics WindowsReport[.]com. The goal is to trick unsuspecting users searching for CPU-Z on search engines like Google by serving malicious ads that, when clicked, redirect them to the fake portal (workspace-app[.]online).

Iranian nation-state actors have been observed using a previously undocumented command-and-control (C2) framework called&nbsp; MuddyC2Go &nbsp;as part of&nbsp; attacks targeting Israel . "The framework's web component is written in the Go programming language," Deep Instinct security researcher Simon Kenin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report published Wednesday.

A new variant of the&nbsp; GootLoader malware &nbsp;called GootBot has been found to facilitate lateral movement on compromised systems and evade detection. "The GootLoader group's introduction of their own custom bot into the late stages of their attack chain is an attempt to avoid detections when using off-the-shelf tools for C2 such as CobaltStrike or RDP," IBM X-Force researchers Golo Mühr and Ole Villadsen&nbsp; said . "This new variant is a lightweight but effective malware allowing attackers to rapidly spread throughout the network and deploy further payloads."

Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a new dropper-as-a-service (DaaS) for Android called&nbsp; SecuriDropper &nbsp;that bypasses new security restrictions imposed by Google and delivers the malware. Dropper malware on Android is designed to function as a conduit to install a payload on a compromised device, making it a lucrative business model for threat actors, who can advertise the capabilities to other criminal groups. What's more, doing so also allows adversaries to separate the development and execution of an attack from the installation of the malware. "Droppers and the actors behind them are in a constant state of evolution as they strive to outwit evolving security measures," Dutch cybersecurity firm ThreatFabric&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new set of malicious packages published to the NuGet package manager using a lesser-known method for malware deployment. Software supply chain security firm ReversingLabs described the campaign as coordinated and ongoing since August 1, 2023, while linking it to a&nbsp; host of rogue NuGet packages &nbsp;that were observed delivering a remote access trojan called SeroXen RAT . "The threat actors behind it are tenacious in their desire to plant malware into the NuGet repository, and to continuously publish new malicious packages," Karlo Zanki, reverse engineer at ReversingLabs,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The names of some of the packages are below - Pathoschild.Stardew.Mod.Build.Config KucoinExchange.Net Kraken.Exchange DiscordsRpc SolanaWallet Monero Modern.Winform.UI MinecraftPocket.Server IAmRoot ZendeskApi.Client.V2 Betalgo.Open.AI Forge.Open.AI Pathoschild.Stardew.Mod.BuildConfig CData.NetSuite.Net.

iLeakage: New Safari Exploit Impacts Apple iPhones and Macs with A and M-Series CPUs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/10/ileakage-new-safari-exploit-impacts.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics has devised a novel side-channel attack dubbed&nbsp; iLeakage &nbsp;that exploits a weakness in the A- and M-series CPUs running on Apple iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices, enabling the extraction of sensitive information from the Safari web browser. "An attacker can induce Safari to render an arbitrary webpage, subsequently recovering sensitive information present within it using speculative execution," researchers Jason Kim, Stephan van Schaik, Daniel Genkin, and Yuval Yarom&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new study. In a practical attack scenario, the weakness could be exploited using a malicious web page to recover Gmail inbox content and even recover passwords that are autofilled by credential managers. iLeakage, besides being the first case of a&nbsp; Spectre-style &nbsp; speculative execution &nbsp; attack &nbsp;against Apple Silicon CPUs, also works against all third-party web browsers available for iOS and iPadOS owing to Apple's App Store policy that mandates browser vendors to use Safari&amp;

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The backdoor implanted on Cisco devices by exploiting a pair of zero-day flaws in IOS XE software has been modified by the threat actor so as to escape visibility via previous fingerprinting methods. "Investigated network traffic to a compromised device has shown that the threat actor has upgraded the implant to do an extra header check," NCC Group's Fox-IT team&nbsp; said . "Thus, for a lot of devices, the implant is still active, but now only responds if the correct Authorization HTTP header is set." The attacks entail fashioning&nbsp; CVE-2023-20198 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 10.0) and&nbsp; CVE-2023-20273 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.2) into an exploit chain that grants the threat actor the ability to gain access to the devices, create a privileged account, and ultimately deploy a Lua-based implant on the devices. The development comes as Cisco began rolling out security updates to&nbsp; address the issues , with more updates to come at an as-yet-undisclosed date. The exact identity of the threat

The Android banking trojan known as&nbsp; SpyNote &nbsp;has been dissected to reveal its diverse information-gathering features. Typically spread via SMS phishing campaigns, attack chains involving the spyware trick potential victims into installing the app by clicking on the embedded link, according to F-Secure. Besides requesting invasive permissions to access call logs, camera, SMS messages, and external storage, SpyNote is known for hiding its presence from the Android home screen and the&nbsp; Recents screen &nbsp;in a bid to make it difficult to avoid detection. "The SpyNote malware app can be launched via an external trigger," F-Secure researcher Amit Tambe&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week.

A piece of malware known as&nbsp; DarkGate &nbsp;has been observed being spread via instant messaging platforms such as Skype and Microsoft Teams.

A malicious package hosted on the NuGet package manager for the .NET Framework has been found to deliver a remote access trojan called SeroXen RAT. The package, named Pathoschild.Stardew.Mod.Build.Config and published by a user named&nbsp; Disti , is a typosquat of a legitimate package called&nbsp; Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig , software supply chain security firm Phylum&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report today. While the real package has received nearly 79,000 downloads to date, the malicious variant is said to have artificially inflated its download count after being published on October 6, 2023, to surpass 100,000 downloads. The profile behind the package has published six other packages that have attracted no less than 2.1 million downloads cumulatively, four of which masquerade as libraries for various crypto services like Kraken, KuCoin, Solana, and Monero, but are also designed to deploy SeroXen RAT. The attack chain is initiated during installation of the package by means of a tools/init.ps1

New findings have identified connections between an Android spyware called DragonEgg and another sophisticated modular iOS surveillanceware tool named LightSpy .

Zanubis,&nbsp; originally documented &nbsp;in August 2022, is the latest addition to a&nbsp; long list of Android banker malware &nbsp;targeting the Latin American (LATAM) region. Targets include more than 40 banks and financial entities in Peru. It's mainly known for abusing accessibility permissions on the infected device to display fake overlay screens atop the targeted apps in an attempt to steal credentials. it's also capable of harvesting contact data, list of installed apps, and system metadata. Kaspersky said it observed recent samples of Zanubis in the w

Microsoft's AI-Powered Bing Chat Ads May Lead Users to Malware-Distributing Sites<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/microsofts-ai-powered-bing-chat-ads-may.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious ads served inside Microsoft Bing's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot are being used to distribute malware when searching for popular tools. The findings come from Malwarebytes, which revealed that unsuspecting users can be tricked into visiting booby-trapped sites and installing malware directly from Bing Chat conversations. Introduced by Microsoft in February 2023, Bing Chat is an&nbsp; interactive search experience &nbsp;that's powered by OpenAI's large language model called&nbsp; GPT-4 . A month later, the tech giant&nbsp; began &nbsp; exploring &nbsp;placing ads in the conversations. But the move has also opened the doors for threat actors who resort to malvertising tactics and propagate malware. "Ads can be inserted into a Bing Chat conversation in various ways," Jérôme Segura, director of threat intelligence at Malwarebytes,&nbsp; said . "One of those is when a user hovers over a link and an ad is displayed first before the organic result." In an example highligh

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware strain called ZenRAT has emerged in the wild that's distributed via bogus installation packages of the Bitwarden password manager. "The malware is specifically targeting Windows users and will redirect people using other hosts to a benign web page," enterprise security firm Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. "The malware is a modular remote access trojan (RAT) with information stealing capabilities." ZenRAT is hosted on fake websites pretending to be associated with Bitwarden, although it's uncertain as to how traffic is being directed to the domains. Such malware has been propagated via phishing, malvertising, or SEO poisoning attacks in the past. The payload (Bitwarden-Installer-version-2023-7-1.exe), downloaded from crazygameis[.]com, is a trojanized version of the standard Bitwarden installation package that contains a malicious .NET executable (ApplicationRuntimeMonitor.exe).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An updated version of an&nbsp; Android banking trojan &nbsp;called&nbsp; Xenomorph &nbsp;has set its sights on more than 35 financial institutions in the U.S. The campaign, according to Dutch security firm ThreatFabric, leverages phishing web pages that are designed to entice victims into installing malicious Android apps that target a broader list of apps than its predecessors. Some of the other targeted prominent countries targeted comprise Spain, Canada, Italy, and Belgium. "This new list adds dozens of new overlays for institutions from the United States, Portugal, and multiple crypto wallets, following a trend that has been consistent amongst all banking malware families in the last year," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published Monday. Xenomorph is a variant of another banker malware called Alien which&nbsp; first emerged &nbsp;in 2022.

Deadglyph: New Advanced Backdoor with Distinctive Malware Tactics<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/deadglyph-new-advanced-backdoor-with.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a previously undocumented advanced backdoor dubbed&nbsp; Deadglyph &nbsp;employed by a threat actor known as Stealth Falcon as part of a cyber espionage campaign. "Deadglyph's architecture is unusual as it consists of cooperating components – one a native x64 binary, the other a .NET assembly," ESET&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a&nbsp; new report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News. "This combination is unusual because malware typically uses only one programming language for its components. This difference might indicate separate development of those two components while also taking advantage of unique features of the distinct programming languages they utilize." It's also suspected that the use of different programming languages is a deliberate tactic to hinder analysis, making it a lot more challenging to navigate and debug. Unlike other traditional backdoors of its kind, the commands are received from an actor-controlled server in the form of additi

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An active malware campaign targeting Latin America is dispensing a new variant of a banking trojan called&nbsp; BBTok , particularly users in Brazil and Mexico. "The BBTok banker has a dedicated functionality that replicates the interfaces of more than 40 Mexican and Brazilian banks, and tricks the victims into entering its 2FA code to their bank accounts or into entering their payment card number," Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in research published this week. The payloads are generated by a custom server-side PowerShell script and are unique for each victim based on the operating system and country, while being delivered via phishing emails that leverage a variety of file types. BBTok is a Windows-based banking malware that&nbsp; first surfaced &nbsp;in 2020. It's equipped with features that run the typical trojan gamut, allowing it to enumerate and kill processes, issue remote commands, manipulate keyboard, and serve fake login pages for banks operating in the two countries.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The peer-to-peer (P2) worm known as&nbsp; P2PInfect &nbsp;has witnessed a surge in activity since late August 2023, witnessing a 600x jump between September 12 and 19, 2023. "This increase in P2PInfect traffic has coincided with a growing number of variants seen in the wild, suggesting that the malware's developers are operating at an extremely high development cadence," Cado Security researcher Matt Muir said in a report published Wednesday. A majority of the compromises have been reported in China, the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. P2PInfect first came to light in July 2023 for its ability to breach poorly secured Redis instances. The threat actors behind the campaign have since resorted to different approaches for initial access, including the abuse of the database's replication feature to deliver the malware. Cado Security said it has observed an increase in initial access events attributable to P2PInfect in which the Redis SLAVEOF command

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new analysis of the Android banking trojan known as Hook has revealed that it's based on its predecessor called ERMAC. "The ERMAC source code was used as a base for Hook," NCC Group security researchers Joshua Kamp and Alberto Segura&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical analysis published last week. "All commands (30 in total) that the malware operator can send to a device infected with ERMAC malware, also exist in Hook. The code implementation for these commands is nearly identical." Hook was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by ThreatFabric in January 2023, describing it as a " ERMAC &nbsp;fork" that's offered for sale for $7,000 per month. Both the strains are the work of a malware author called DukeEugene. That said, Hook expands on ERMAC's functionalities with more capabilities, supporting as many as 38 additional commands when compared to the latter. ERMAC's core features are designed to send SMS messages, display a phishing window on top of a legitimate app, e

A new information stealer malware called MetaStealer has set its sights on Apple macOS, making the latest in a growing list of stealer families focused on the operating system after&nbsp; Stealer ,&nbsp; Pureland ,&nbsp; Atomic Stealer , and&nbsp; Realst . "Threat actors are proactively targeting macOS businesses by posing as fake clients in order to socially engineer victims into launching malicious payloads," SentinelOne security researcher Phil Stokes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday analysis. In these attacks, MetaStealer is distributed in the form of rogue application bundles in the disk image format (DMG), with targets approached through threat actors posing as prospective design clients in order to share a password-protected ZIP archive containing the DMG file. Other instances have involved the malware masquerading as Adobe files or installers for Adobe Photoshop.

A new malware loader called HijackLoader is gaining traction among the cybercriminal community to deliver various payloads such as&nbsp; DanaBot ,&nbsp; SystemBC , and&nbsp; RedLine Stealer .

First observed by the company in July 2023, the malware employs a number of techniques to fly under the radar. This involves using syscalls to evade monitoring from security solutions, monitoring processes associated with security software based on an embedded blocklist, and putting off code execution by as much as 40 seconds at different stages.

According to Kaspersky security researcher Igor Golovin, the apps come with&nbsp; nefarious features &nbsp;to capture and exfiltrate names, user IDs, contacts, phone numbers, and chat messages to an actor-controlled server. The activity has been codenamed&nbsp; Evil Telegram &nbsp;by the Russian cybersecurity company. The apps have been collectively downloaded millions of times before they were taken down by Google.

Banking and logistics industries are under the onslaught of a reworked variant of a malware called&nbsp; Chaes .

A subsequent analysis from Avast in early 2022&nbsp; found &nbsp;that the threat actors behind the operation, who call themselves Lucifer, had breached more than 800 WordPress websites to deliver Chaes to users of Banco do Brasil, Loja Integrada, Mercado Bitcoin, Mercado Livre, and Mercado Pago.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have called attention to a new antivirus evasion technique that involves embedding a malicious Microsoft Word file into a PDF file. The sneaky method, dubbed&nbsp; MalDoc in PDF &nbsp;by JPCERT/CC, is said to have been employed in an in-the-wild attack in July 2023. "A file created with MalDoc in PDF can be opened in Word even though it has magic numbers and file structure of PDF," researchers Yuma Masubuchi and Kota Kino&nbsp; said . "If the file has a configured macro, by opening it in Word, VBS runs and performs malicious behaviors." Such specially crafted files are called&nbsp; polyglots &nbsp;as they are a legitimate form of multiple different file types, in this case, both PDF and Word (DOC). This entails adding an MHT file created in Word and with a macro attached after the PDF file object. The end result is a valid PDF file that can also be opened in the Word application. Put differently; the PDF document embeds within itself a Word document with a VB

Cybersecurity and intelligence agencies from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. on Thursday disclosed details of a mobile malware strain targeting Android devices used by the Ukrainian military.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An open-source .NET-based information stealer malware dubbed&nbsp; SapphireStealer &nbsp;is being used by multiple entities to enhance its capabilities and spawn their own bespoke variants. "Information-stealing malware like SapphireStealer can be used to obtain sensitive information, including corporate credentials, which are often resold to other threat actors who leverage the access for additional attacks, including operations related to espionage or ransomware/extortion," Cisco Talos researcher Edmund Brumaghin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. An entire ecosystem has developed over time that allows both financially motivated and nation-state actors to use services from purveyors of stealer malware to carry out various kinds of attacks. Viewed in that light, such malware not only represents an evolution of the cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS) model, they also offer other threat actors to monetize the stolen data to distribute ransomware, conduct data theft, and other maliciou

A previously undocumented Android banking trojan dubbed&nbsp; MMRat &nbsp;has been observed targeting mobile users in Southeast Asia since late June 2023 to remotely commandeer the devices and perform financial fraud.

In yet another sign that developers continue to be targets of software supply chain attacks, a number of malicious packages have been discovered on the Rust programming language's crate registry.

The SmokeLoader malware is being used to deliver a new Wi-Fi scanning malware strain called&nbsp; Whiffy Recon &nbsp;on compromised Windows machines. "The new malware strain has only one operation. Every 60 seconds it triangulates the infected systems' positions by scanning nearby Wi-Fi access points as a data point for Google's geolocation API," Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement shared with The Hacker News. "The location returned by Google's&nbsp; Geolocation API &nbsp;is then sent back to the adversary." SmokeLoader , as the name implies, is a loader malware whose sole purpose is to drop additional payloads onto a host. Since 2014, the malware has been&nbsp; offered for sale &nbsp;to Russian-based threat actors. It's traditionally distributed via phishing emails. Whiffy Recon works by checking for the WLAN AutoConfig service (WLANSVC) on the infected system and terminating itself if the service name doesn't exist. It's worth noting that th

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More than a dozen malicious packages have been discovered on the npm package repository since the start of August 2023 with capabilities to deploy an open-source information stealer called&nbsp; Luna Token Grabber &nbsp;on systems belonging to Roblox developers. The ongoing campaign, first detected on August 1 by ReversingLabs, employs modules that masquerade as the legitimate package&nbsp; noblox.js , an API wrapper that's used to create scripts that interact with the Roblox gaming platform. The software supply chain security company described the activity as a "replay of an attack&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;two years ago" in October 2021. "The malicious packages [...] reproduce code from the legitimate noblox.js package but add malicious, information-stealing functions," software threat researcher Lucija Valentić&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. The packages were cumulatively downloaded 963 times before they were taken down. The names of the rogue packages are as follows - noblox.js-v

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new variant of an&nbsp; Apple macOS malware &nbsp;called&nbsp; XLoader &nbsp;has surfaced in the wild, masquerading its malicious features under the guise of an office productivity app called "OfficeNote." "The new version of XLoader is bundled inside a standard Apple disk image with the name OfficeNote.dmg," SentinelOne security researchers Dinesh Devadoss and Phil Stokes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday analysis. "The application contained within is signed with the developer signature MAIT JAKHU (54YDV8NU9C)." XLoader , first detected in 2020, is&nbsp; considered &nbsp;a successor to Formbook and is an information stealer and keylogger offered under the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model. A macOS variant of the malware emerged in July 2021, distributed as a Java program in the form of a compiled .JAR file. "Such files require the Java Runtime Environment, and for that reason the malicious .jar file will not execute on a macOS install out of the box, since Apple stopped shipping JRE with

Threat actors are leveraging access to malware-infected Windows and macOS machines to deliver a proxy server application and use them as exit nodes to reroute proxy requests. According to AT&amp;T Alien Labs, the unnamed company that offers the proxy service operates more than 400,000 proxy exit nodes, although it's not immediately clear how many of them were co-opted by malware installed on infected machines without user knowledge and interaction. "Although the proxy website claims that its exit nodes come only from users who have been informed and agreed to the use of their device," the cybersecurity company&nbsp; said &nbsp;it found evidence where "malware writers are installing the proxy silently in infected systems." Multiple malware families have been observed delivering the proxy to users searching for cracked software and games.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed an updated version of an advanced fingerprinting and redirection toolkit called&nbsp; WoofLocker &nbsp;that's engineered to conduct tech support scams. The sophisticated traffic redirection scheme was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Malwarebytes in January 2020, leveraging JavaScript embedded in compromised websites to perform anti-bot and web traffic filtering checks to serve next-stage JavaScript that redirects users to a browser locker (aka browlock). This redirection mechanism, in turn, makes use of steganographic tricks to conceal the JavaScript code within a PNG image that's served only when the validation phase is successful. Should a user be detected as a bot or not interesting traffic, a decoy PNG file without the malicious code is used. WoofLocker is also known as 404Browlock due to the fact that visiting the browlock URL directly without the appropriate redirection or one-time session token results in a 404 error page.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are using Android Package (APK) files with unknown or unsupported compression methods to elude malware analysis. That's according to findings from Zimperium, which found 3,300 artifacts leveraging such compression algorithms in the wild. 71 of the identified samples can be loaded on the operating system without any problems. There is no evidence that the apps were available on the Google Play Store at any point in time, indicating that the apps were distributed through other means, typically via untrusted app stores or social engineering to trick the victims into sideloading them. The APK files use "a technique that limits the possibility of decompiling the application for a large number of tools, reducing the possibilities of being analyzed," security researcher Fernando Ortega&nbsp; said . "In order to do that, the APK (which is in essence a ZIP file), is using an unsupported decompression method." The advantage of such an approach is its abilit

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Account holders of over numerous financial institutions in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Peru are being targeted by an Android banking malware called&nbsp; Gigabud RAT . "One of Gigabud RAT's unique features is that it doesn't execute any malicious actions until the user is authorized into the malicious application by a fraudster, [...] which makes it harder to detect," Group-IB researchers Pavel Naumov and Artem Grischenko&nbsp; said . "Instead of using HTML overlay attacks, Gigabud RAT gathers sensitive information primarily through screen recording." Gigabud RAT was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Cyble in January 2023 after it was spotted impersonating bank and government apps to siphon sensitive data. It's known to be active in the wild since at least July 2022. The Singapore-based company said it also identified a second variant of the malware minus the RAT capabilities.

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a set of 11 living-off-the-land binaries-and-scripts ( LOLBAS ) that could be maliciously abused by threat actors to conduct post-exploitation activities.&nbsp; "LOLBAS is an attack method that uses binaries and scripts that are already part of the system for malicious purposes," Pentera security researcher Nir Chako&nbsp; said . "This makes it hard for security teams to distinguish between legitimate and malicious activities, since they are all performed by trusted system utilities." To that end, the Israeli cybersecurity company said it uncovered nine LOLBAS downloaders and three executors that could enable adversaries to download and execute "more robust malware" on infected hosts. This includes: MsoHtmEd.exe, Mspub.exe, ProtocolHandler.exe, ConfigSecurityPolicy.exe, InstallUtil.exe, Mshta.exe, Presentationhost.exe, Outlook.exe, MSAccess.exe, scp.exe, and sftp.exe.&nbsp; "In a complete attack chain, a hacker will us

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware campaign has been observed making use of malicious OpenBullet configuration files to target inexperienced cyber criminals with the goal of delivering a remote access trojan (RAT) capable of stealing sensitive information. Bot mitigation company Kasada&nbsp; said &nbsp;the activity is designed to "exploit trusted criminal networks," describing it as an instance of advanced threat actors "preying on beginner hackers." OpenBullet &nbsp;is a legitimate&nbsp; open-source pen testing tool &nbsp;used for automating credential stuffing attacks. It takes in a&nbsp; configuration file &nbsp;that's tailored to a specific website and can combine it with a password list procured through other means to log successful attempts. "OpenBullet can be used with Puppeteer, which is a headless browser that can be used for automating web interactions," the company&nbsp; said .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Vulnerable&nbsp; Redis services &nbsp;have been targeted by a "new, improved, dangerous" variant of a malware called SkidMap that's engineered to target a wide range of Linux distributions. "The malicious nature of this malware is to adapt to the system on which it is executed," Trustwave security researcher Radoslaw Zdonczyk&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. Some of the Linux distribution SkidMap sets its eyes on include Alibaba, Anolis, openEuler, EulerOS, Stream, CentOS, RedHat, and Rocky. SkidMap was&nbsp; first disclosed &nbsp;by Trend Micro in September 2019 as a cryptocurrency mining botnet with capabilities to load malicious kernel modules that can obfuscate its activities as well as monitor the miner process. The operators of the malware have also been found camouflaging their backup command-and-control (C2) IP address on the Bitcoin blockchain, evocative of another botnet malware known as&nbsp; Glupteba .

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are using an open-source rootkit called&nbsp; Reptile &nbsp;to target Linux systems in South Korea. "Unlike other rootkit malware that typically only provide concealment capabilities, Reptile goes a step further by offering a reverse shell, allowing threat actors to easily take control of systems," the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. "Port knocking is a method where the malware opens a specific port on an infected system and goes on standby. When the threat actor sends a magic packet to the system, the received packet is used as a basis to establish a connection with the C&amp;C server." A rootkit is a malicious software program that's designed to provide privileged, root-level access to a machine while concealing its presence. At least four different campaigns have leveraged Reptile since 2022. The first use of the rootkit was&nbsp; recorded &nbsp;by Trend Micro in May 2022 in connection with an intrusion

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new bunch of malicious packages on the npm package registry that are designed to exfiltrate sensitive developer information. Software supply chain firm Phylum, which first identified the "test" packages on July 31, 2023, said they "demonstrated increasing functionality and refinement," hours after which they were removed and re-uploaded under different, legitimate-sounding package names. While the end goal of the undertaking is not clear, it's suspected to be a highly targeted campaign&nbsp; aimed at the cryptocurrency sector &nbsp;based on references to modules such as "rocketrefer" and "binarium." All the packages were published by the npm user malikrukd4732. A common feature across all the modules is the ability to launch JavaScript ("index.js") that's equipped to exfiltrate valuable information to a remote server.

Malicious Apps Use Sneaky Versioning Technique to Bypass Google Play Store Scanners<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/malicious-apps-use-sneaky-versioning.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are leveraging a technique called versioning to evade Google Play Store's malware detections and target Android users. "Campaigns using versioning commonly target users' credentials, data, and finances," Google Cybersecurity Action Team (GCAT)&nbsp; s aid &nbsp;in its August 2023 Threat Horizons Report shared with The Hacker News. While versioning is not a new phenomenon, it's sneaky and hard to detect. In this method, a developer releases an initial version of an app on the Play Store that passes Google's pre-publication checks, but is later updated with a malware component. This is achieved by pushing an update from an attacker-controlled server to serve malicious code on the end user device using a method called dynamic code loading (DCL), effectively turning the app into a backdoor. Earlier this May, ESET&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;a screen recording app named "iRecorder - Screen Recorder" that remained innocuous for nearly a year after it was first

The P2PInfect peer-to-peer (P2) worm has been observed employing previously undocumented initial access methods to breach susceptible Redis servers and rope them into a botnet. "The malware compromises exposed instances of the Redis data store by exploiting the replication feature," Cado Security researchers Nate Bill and Matt Muir&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actors linked to the malware loader known as IcedID have made updates to the BackConnect (BC) module that's used for post-compromise activity on hacked systems, new findings from Team Cymru reveal. IcedID, also called BokBot , is a strain of malware similar to&nbsp; Emotet &nbsp;and&nbsp; QakBot &nbsp;that started off as a banking trojan in 2017, before switching to the role of an initial access facilitator for other payloads. Recent versions of the malware have been&nbsp; observed &nbsp;removing functionality related to online banking fraud to prioritize ransomware delivery. The BackConnect (BC) module,&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Netresec in October 2022, relies on a proprietary command-and-control (C2) protocol to exchange commands between a server and the infected host. The protocol, which comes with a VNC component for remote access, has also been identified in other malware such as the now-discontinued&nbsp; BazarLoader &nbsp;and QakBot.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A deeper analysis of a recently discovered malware called&nbsp; Decoy Dog &nbsp;has revealed that it's a significant upgrade over the&nbsp; Pupy RAT , an open-source remote access trojan it's modeled on. "Decoy Dog has a full suite of powerful, previously unknown capabilities – including the ability to move victims to another controller, allowing them to maintain communication with compromised machines and remain hidden for long periods of time," Infoblox&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. "Some victims have actively communicated with a Decoy Dog server for over a year." Other new features allow the malware to execute arbitrary Java code on the client and connect to emergency controllers using a mechanism that's similar to a traditional DNS domain generation algorithm ( DGA ), with the Decoy Dog domains engineered to respond to replayed DNS queries from breached clients. The sophisticated toolkit was&nbsp; first discovered &nbsp;by the cybersecurity firm in early April 2023 after

Following the footsteps of&nbsp; WormGPT , threat actors are advertising yet another cybercrime generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool dubbed&nbsp; FraudGPT &nbsp;on various dark web marketplaces and Telegram channels. "This is an AI bot, exclusively targeted for offensive purposes, such as crafting spear phishing emails, creating cracking tools, carding, etc.," Netenrich security researcher Rakesh Krishnan &nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday. The cybersecurity firm said the offering has been circulating since at least July 22, 2023, for a subscription cost of $200 a month (or $1,000 for six months and $1,700 for a year). "If your [sic] looking for a Chat GPT alternative designed to provide a wide range of exclusive tools, features, and capabilities tailored to anyone's individuals with no boundaries then look no further!," claims the actor, who goes by the online alias CanadianKingpin.

Casbaneiro Banking Malware Goes Under the Radar with UAC Bypass Technique<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/casbaneiro-banking-malware-goes-under.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The financially motivated threat actors behind the&nbsp; Casbaneiro &nbsp;banking malware family have been observed making use of a User Account Control ( UAC ) bypass technique to gain full administrative privileges on a machine, a sign that the threat actor is evolving their tactics to avoid detection and execute malicious code on compromised assets. "They are still heavily focused on Latin American financial institutions, but the changes in their techniques represent a significant risk to multi-regional financial organizations as well," Sygnia&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement shared with The Hacker News. Casbaneiro , also known as Metamorfo and Ponteiro, is best known for its banking trojan, which first emerged in mass email spam campaigns targeting the Latin American financial sector in 2018. Infection chains typically begin with a phishing email pointing to a booby-trapped attachment that, when launched, activates a series of steps that culminate in the deployment of the banking malware

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware strain known as BundleBot has been stealthily operating under the radar by taking advantage of&nbsp; .NET single-file deployment techniques , enabling threat actors to capture sensitive information from compromised hosts. "BundleBot is abusing the dotnet bundle (single-file), self-contained format that results in very low or no static detection at all," Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week, adding it is "commonly distributed via Facebook Ads and compromised accounts leading to websites masquerading as regular program utilities, AI tools, and games." Some of these websites aim to mimic Google Bard, the company's conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot, enticing victims into downloading a bogus RAR archive ("Google_AI.rar") hosted on legitimate cloud storage services such as Dropbox.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new cloud targeting, peer-to-peer (P2P) worm called&nbsp; P2PInfect &nbsp;that targets vulnerable Redis instances for follow-on exploitation. "P2PInfect exploits Redis servers running on both Linux and Windows Operating Systems making it more scalable and potent than other worms," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers William Gamazo and Nathaniel Quist&nbsp; said . "This worm is also written in Rust, a highly scalable and cloud-friendly programming language." It's estimated that as many as 934 unique Redis systems may be vulnerable to the threat. The first known instance of P2PInfect was detected on July 11, 2023. A notable characteristic of the worm is its ability to infects vulnerable Redis instances by exploiting a critical Lua sandbox escape vulnerability,&nbsp; CVE-2022-0543 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 10.0), which has been previously exploited to deliver multiple&nbsp; malware families &nbsp;such as&nbsp; Muhstik ,&nbsp; Redigo , and&nbsp; HeadCrab &nbsp;over the past ye

A new malware strain has been found covertly targeting small office/home office (SOHO) routers for more than two years, infiltrating over 70,000 devices and creating a botnet with 40,000 nodes spanning 20 countries.

This vulnerability enables unauthorized attackers to execute malicious code with the SYSTEM user's privileges, granting them unrestricted access to compromised systems. The TrueBot malware , linked with cybercriminal collectives Silence and FIN11, is deployed to siphon off data and disseminate ransomware, jeopardising the safety of numerous infiltrated networks. The cybercriminals gain their initial foothold by exploiting the cited vulnerability, then proceed to install TrueBot. Once they have breached the networks, they install the FlawedGrace Remote Access Trojan (RAT) to escalate their p

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Iranian nation-state actor known as TA453 has been linked to a new set of spear-phishing attacks that infect both Windows and macOS operating systems with malware. "TA453 eventually used a variety of cloud hosting providers to deliver a novel infection chain that deploys the newly identified PowerShell backdoor GorjolEcho," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "When given the opportunity, TA453 ported its malware and attempted to launch an Apple flavored infection chain dubbed NokNok. TA453 also employed&nbsp; multi-persona impersonation &nbsp;in its unending espionage quest." TA453, also known by the names APT35, Charming Kitten, Mint Sandstorm, and Yellow Garuda, is a threat group linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) that has been active since at least 2011. Most recently, Volexity highlighted the adversary's use of an updated version of a Powershell implant called&nbsp; CharmPower &nbsp;(aka GhostEcho or POWERSTAR). In the attack sequence discove

Node.js Users Beware: Manifest Confusion Attack Opens Door to Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/nodejs-users-beware-manifest-confusion.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The npm registry for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment is susceptible to what's called a&nbsp; manifest confusion &nbsp;attack that could potentially allow threat actors to conceal malware in project dependencies or perform arbitrary script execution during installation. "A npm package's manifest is published independently from its tarball," Darcy Clarke, a former GitHub and npm engineering manager,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published last week. "Manifests are never fully validated against the tarball's contents." "The ecosystem has broadly assumed the contents of the manifest and tarball are consistent," Clarke added. The problem, at its core, stems from the fact that the manifest and package metadata are decoupled and that they are never cross-referenced against one another, thereby leading to unexpected behavior and misuse when there is a mismatch. As a result, a threat actor could exploit this loophole to publish a module with a ma

In yet another sign of a lucrative crimeware-as-a-service ( CaaS ) ecosystem, cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new Windows-based information stealer called&nbsp; Meduza Stealer &nbsp;that's actively being developed by its author to evade detection by software solutions. "The Meduza Stealer has a singular objective: comprehensive data theft," Uptycs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.

"From critical login credentials to the valuable record of browsing history and meticulously curated bookmarks, no digital artifact is safe. Even crypto wallet extensions, password managers, and 2FA extensions are vulnerable." Despite the similarity in features, Meduza boasts of a "crafty" operational design that eschews the use of obfuscation techniques and promptly terminates its execution on compromised hosts should a connection to the attacker's server fail.

Researchers have pulled back the curtain on an updated version of an Apple macOS malware called RustBucket that comes with improved&nbsp;capabilities to establish persistence and avoid detection by security software. "This variant of RustBucket, a malware family that targets macOS systems, adds persistence capabilities not previously observed," Elastic Security Labs researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week, adding it's "leveraging a dynamic network infrastructure methodology for command-and-control." RustBucket is the work of a North Korean threat actor known as BlueNoroff, which is part of a larger intrusion set tracked under the name&nbsp; Lazarus Group , an elite hacking unit supervised by the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), the country's primary intelligence agency. The malware came to light in April 2023, when Jamf Threat Labs&nbsp; described &nbsp;it as an AppleScript-based backdoor capable of retrieving a second-stage payload from a remote server. Elas

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have shared the inner workings of an Android malware family called&nbsp; Fluhorse . The malware "represents a significant shift as it incorporates the malicious components directly within the Flutter code," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Axelle Apvrille&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. Fluhorse was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Check Point in early May 2023, detailing its attacks on users located in East Asia through rogue apps masquerading as ETC and VPBank Neo, which are popular in Taiwan and Vietnam. The initial intrusion vector for the malware is phishing. The ultimate goal of the app is to steal credentials, credit card details, and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes received as SMS to a remote server under the control of the threat actors. The latest findings from Fortinet, which reverse-engineered a&nbsp; Fluhorse sample &nbsp;uploaded to VirusTotal on June 11, 2023, suggest that the malware has evolved, incorporating additional sophistication b

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Windows-based information stealer called&nbsp; ThirdEye &nbsp;has been discovered in the wild with capabilities to harvest sensitive data from infected hosts. Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, which&nbsp; made the discovery , said it found the malware in an executable that masqueraded as a&nbsp; PDF file &nbsp;with a Russian name "CMK Правила оформления больничных листов.pdf.exe," which translates to "CMK Rules for issuing sick leaves.pdf.exe." The arrival vector for the malware is presently unknown, although the nature of the lure points to it being used in a phishing campaign. The very&nbsp; first ThirdEye sample &nbsp;was uploaded to VirusTotal on April 4, 2023, with relatively fewer features. The evolving stealer, like&nbsp; other malware families &nbsp;of its kind, is equipped to gather system metadata, including BIOS release date and vendor, total/free disk space on the C drive, currently running processes, register usernames, and volume information.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new process injection technique dubbed Mockingjay could be exploited by threat actors to bypass security solutions to execute malicious code on compromised systems. "The injection is executed without space allocation, setting permissions or even starting a thread," Security Joes researchers Thiago Peixoto, Felipe Duarte, and Ido Naor&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The uniqueness of this technique is that it requires a vulnerable DLL and copying code to the right section." Process injection is an&nbsp; attack method &nbsp;that allows adversaries to inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses and elevate privileges. In doing so, it could allow for the execution of arbitrary code in the memory space of a separate live process. Some of the well-known process injection techniques include dynamic link library (DLL) injection, portable executable injection, thread execution hijacking, process hollowing, and process doppelgänging, amon

A new strain of JavaScript dropper has been observed delivering next-stage payloads like Bumblebee and IcedID. Cybersecurity firm Deep Instinct is tracking the malware as&nbsp; PindOS , which contains the name in its " User-Agent " string. Both&nbsp; Bumblebee &nbsp;and IcedID serve as loaders, acting as a vector for other malware on compromised hosts, including ransomware.

Bumblebee , notably, is a replacement for another loader called&nbsp; BazarLoader , which has been attributed to the now-defunct TrickBot and Conti groups. A report from Secureworks in April 2022&nbsp; found &nbsp;evidence of collaboration between several actors in the Russian cybercrime ecosystem, including that of&nbsp; Conti ,&nbsp; Emotet , and IcedID.

More details have emerged about the spyware implant that's delivered to iOS devices as part of a campaign called Operation Triangulation. Kaspersky, which&nbsp; discovered the operation &nbsp;after becoming one of the targets at the start of the year, said the malware has a lifespan of 30 days, after which it gets automatically uninstalled unless the time period is extended by the attackers.

"The implant is deployed after the attackers obtain root privileges on the target iOS device by exploiting a kernel vulnerability," Kaspersky researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today. "It is deployed in memory, meaning that all traces of the implant are lost when the device gets rebooted. Therefore, if the victim reboots their device, the attackers have to reinfect it by sending an iMessage with a malicious attachment, thus launching the whole exploitation chain again."

New Condi Malware Hijacking TP-Link Wi-Fi Routers for DDoS Botnet Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-condi-malware-hijacking-tp-link-wi.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware called&nbsp; Condi &nbsp;has been observed exploiting a security vulnerability in TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800) Wi-Fi routers to rope the devices into a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet. Fortinet FortiGuard Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;the campaign has ramped up since the end of May 2023. Condi is the work of a threat actor who goes by the online alias zxcr9999 on Telegram and runs a Telegram channel called Condi Network to advertise their warez. "The Telegram channel was started in May 2022, and the threat actor has been monetizing its botnet by providing DDoS-as-a-service and selling the malware source code," security researchers Joie Salvio and Roy Tay said. An analysis of the malware artifact reveals its ability to terminate other competing botnets on the same host. It, however, lacks a persistence mechanism, meaning the program cannot survive a system reboot. To get around this limitation, the malware deletes multiple binaries that are used to shut down or reboot the

Rogue Android Apps Target Pakistani Individuals in Sophisticated Espionage Campaign<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/rogue-android-apps-target-pakistani.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Individuals in the Pakistan region have been targeted using two rogue Android apps available on the Google Play Store as part of a new targeted campaign. Cybersecurity firm Cyfirma attributed the campaign with moderate confidence to a threat actor known as&nbsp; DoNot Team , which is also tracked as APT-C-35 and Viceroy Tiger. The espionage activity involves duping Android smartphone owners into downloading a program that's used to extract contact and location data from unwitting victims. "The motive behind the attack is to gather information via the stager payload and use the gathered information for the second-stage attack, using malware with more destructive features," the company&nbsp; said . DoNot Team &nbsp;is a suspected India-nexus threat actor that has a reputation for carrying out attacks against various countries in South Asia. It has been active since at least 2016. While an October 2021 report from Amnesty International linked the group's attack infrastructure to

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new information-stealing malware called&nbsp; Mystic Stealer &nbsp;has been found to steal data from about 40 different web browsers and over 70 web browser extensions. First advertised on April 25, 2023, for $150 per month, the malware also targets cryptocurrency wallets, Steam, and Telegram, and employs extensive mechanisms to resist analysis. "The code is heavily obfuscated making use of polymorphic string obfuscation, hash-based import resolution, and runtime calculation of constants,"&nbsp; InQuest &nbsp;and&nbsp; Zscaler &nbsp;researchers said in an analysis published last week. Mystic Stealer, like many other crimeware solutions that are offered for sale, focuses on pilfering data and is implemented in the C programming language. The control panel has been developed using Python. Updates to the malware in May 2023 incorporate a loader component that allows it to retrieve and execute next-stage payloads fetched from a command-and-control (C2) server, making it a more formidable threat.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a set of malicious artifacts that they say is part of a sophisticated toolkit targeting Apple macOS systems. "As of now, these samples are still largely undetected and very little information is available about any of them," Bitdefender researchers Andrei Lapusneanu and Bogdan Botezatu&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a preliminary report published on Friday. The Romanian firm's analysis is based on an examination of four samples that were uploaded to VirusTotal by an unnamed victim. The earliest sample dates back to April 18, 2023. Two of the three malicious programs are said to be generic Python-based backdoors that are designed to target Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. The payloads have been collectively dubbed&nbsp; JokerSpy . The first constituent is shared.dat, which, once launched, runs an operating system check (0 for Windows, 1 for macOS, and 2 for Linux) and establishes contact with a remote server to fetch additional instructions for execut

The threat actor known as&nbsp; ChamelGang &nbsp;has been observed using a previously undocumented implant to backdoor Linux systems, marking a new expansion of the threat actor's capabilities. The malware, dubbed&nbsp; ChamelDoH &nbsp;by Stairwell, is a C++-based tool for communicating via DNS-over-HTTPS ( DoH ) tunneling. ChamelGang was&nbsp; first outed &nbsp;by Russian cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies in September 2021, detailing its attacks on fuel, energy, and aviation production industries in Russia, the U.S., India, Nepal, Taiwan, and Japan. Attack chains mounted by the actor have leveraged vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application to gain initial access and carry out data theft attacks using a passive backdoor called DoorMe. "This is a native&nbsp; IIS module &nbsp;that is registered as a filter through which HTTP requests and responses are processed," Positive Technologies said at the time.

Vietnamese public companies have been targeted as part of an ongoing campaign that deploys a novel backdoor called&nbsp; SPECTRALVIPER . "SPECTRALVIPER is a heavily obfuscated, previously undisclosed, x64 backdoor that brings PE loading and injection, file upload and download, file and directory manipulation, and token impersonation capabilities," Elastic Security Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Friday report.

New PowerDrop Malware Targeting U.S. Aerospace Industry<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-powerdrop-malware-targeting-us.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been observed targeting the U.S. aerospace industry with a new PowerShell-based malware called PowerDrop . "PowerDrop uses advanced techniques to evade detection such as deception, encoding, and encryption," according to Adlumin, which&nbsp; found the malware &nbsp;implanted in an unnamed domestic aerospace defense contractor in May 2023. "The name is derived from the tool, Windows PowerShell, used to concoct the script, and 'Drop' from the DROP (DRP) string used in the code for padding." PowerDrop is also a post-exploitation tool, meaning it's designed to gather information from victim networks after obtaining initial access through other means. The malware employs Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request messages as beacons to initiate communications with a command-and-control (C2) server. The server, for its part, responds back with an encrypted command that's decoded and run on the compromised host. A similar

New Malware Campaign Leveraging Satacom Downloader to Steal Cryptocurrency<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-malware-campaign-leveraging-satacom.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recent malware campaign has been found to leverage&nbsp; Satacom downloader &nbsp;as a conduit to deploy stealthy malware capable of siphoning cryptocurrency using a rogue extension for Chromium-based browsers. "The main purpose of the malware that is dropped by the Satacom downloader is to steal BTC from the victim's account by performing web injections into targeted cryptocurrency websites," Kaspersky researchers Haim Zigel and Oleg Kupreev&nbsp; said . Targets of the campaign include Coinbase, Bybit, KuCoin, Huobi, and Binance users primarily located in Brazil, Algeria, Turkey, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Egypt, and Mexico. Satacom downloader, also called&nbsp; Legion Loader , first emerged in 2019 as a dropper for next-stage payloads, including information stealers and cryptocurrency miners. Infection chains involving the malware begin when users searching for cracked software are redirected to bogus websites that host ZIP archive files containing the malware. "Various types

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of the "evasive and tenacious" malware known as QBot has revealed that 25% of its command-and-control (C2) servers are merely active for a single day. What's more, 50% of the servers don't remain active for more than a week, indicating the use of an adaptable and dynamic&nbsp; C2 infrastructure , Lumen Black Lotus Labs said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This botnet has adapted techniques to conceal its infrastructure in residential IP space and infected web servers, as opposed to hiding in a network of hosted virtual private servers (VPSs)," security researchers Chris Formosa and Steve Rudd said. QBot , also called QakBot and Pinkslipbot, is a persistent and potent threat that started off as a banking trojan before evolving into a downloader for other payloads, including ransomware.

New Zero-Click Hack Targets iOS Users with Stealthy Root-Privilege Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-zero-click-hack-targets-ios-users.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously unknown advanced persistent threat (APT) is targeting iOS devices as part of a sophisticated and long-running mobile campaign dubbed&nbsp; Operation Triangulation &nbsp;that began in 2019. "The targets are infected using zero-click exploits via the iMessage platform, and the malware runs with root privileges, gaining complete control over the device and user data," Kaspersky&nbsp; said . The Russian cybersecurity company said it discovered traces of compromise after creating offline backups of the targeted devices. The attack chain begins with the iOS device receiving a message via iMessage that contains an attachment bearing the exploit. The exploit is said to be&nbsp; zero-click , meaning the receipt of the message triggers the vulnerability without requiring any user interaction in order to achieve code execution. It's also configured to retrieve additional payloads for privilege escalation and drop a final stage malware from a remote server that Kaspersky described as

Malicious PyPI Packages Using Compiled Python Code to Bypass Detection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/malicious-pypi-packages-using-compiled.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have discovered a novel attack on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that employs compiled Python code to sidestep detection by application security tools. "It may be the first supply chain attack to take advantage of the fact that Python bytecode (PYC) files can be directly executed," ReversingLabs analyst Karlo Zanki&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The package in question is&nbsp; fshec2 , which was removed from the package registry on April 17, 2023, following responsible disclosure on the same day. PYC files are compiled bytecode files that are generated by the Python interpreter when a Python program is executed. "When a module is imported for the first time (or when the source file has changed since the current compiled file was created) a .pyc file containing the compiled code should be created in a __pycache__ subdirectory of the directory containing the .py file,"&nbsp; explains &nbsp;the Python documentation.

The threat actors behind&nbsp; RomCom RAT &nbsp;are leveraging a network of fake websites advertising rogue versions of popular software at least since July 2022 to infiltrate targets. Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro is tracking the activity cluster under the name Void Rabisu, which is also known as Tropical Scorpius (Unit 42) and UNC2596 (Mandiant). "These lure sites are most likely only meant for a small number of targets, thus making discovery and analysis more difficult," security researchers Feike Hacquebord, Stephen Hilt, Fernando Merces, and Lord Alfred Remorin&nbsp; said . Some of the impersonated apps spotted so far include AstraChat, Devolutions' Remote Desktop Manager, Gimp, GoTo Meeting, KeePass, OpenAI ChatGPT, Signal, Veeam Backup &amp; Replication, and WinDirStat. RomCom RAT was&nbsp; first chronicled &nbsp;by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 in August 2022, linking it to a financially motivated group deploying&nbsp; Cuba Ransomware &nbsp;(aka COLDDRAW).

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A crypter (alternatively spelled cryptor) malware dubbed&nbsp; AceCryptor &nbsp;has been used to pack numerous strains of malware since 2016. Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET&nbsp; said &nbsp;it identified over 240,000 detections of the crypter in its telemetry in 2021 and 2022. This amounts to more than 10,000 hits per month. Some of the prominent malware families contained within AceCryptor are SmokeLoader, RedLine Stealer, RanumBot, Raccoon Stealer, Stop ransomware, and Amadey, among others. The countries with the most detections include Peru, Egypt, Thailand, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Poland, and India. AceCryptor was&nbsp; first highlighted &nbsp;by Avast in August 2022, detailing the use of the malware to distribute Stop ransomware and RedLine Stealer on Discord in the form of 7-Zip files. Crypters &nbsp;are similar to packers, but instead of using compression, they are known to obfuscate the malware code with encryption to make detection and reverse engineering a lot more challenging.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Linux routers in Japan are the target of a new Golang remote access trojan (RAT) called&nbsp; GobRAT . "Initially, the attacker targets a router whose WEBUI is open to the public, executes scripts possibly by using vulnerabilities, and finally infects the GobRAT," the JPCERT Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today. The compromise of an internet-exposed router is followed by the deployment of a loader script that acts as a conduit for delivering GobRAT, which, when launched, masquerades as the Apache daemon process (apached) to evade detection. The loader is also equipped to disable firewalls, establish persistence using the cron job scheduler, and register an SSH public key in the&nbsp; .ssh/authorized_keys file &nbsp;for remote access. GobRAT, for its part, communicates with a remote server via the Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) protocol to receive as many as 22 different encrypted commands for execution. Some of the major commands are as follows - Obt

A new stealthy information stealer malware called Bandit Stealer has caught the attention of cybersecurity researchers for its ability to target numerous web browsers and cryptocurrency wallets.&nbsp; "It has the potential to expand to other platforms as Bandit Stealer was developed using the Go programming language, possibly allowing cross-platform compatibility," Trend Micro&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Friday report. The malware is currently focused on targeting Windows by using a legitimate command-line tool called&nbsp; runas.exe &nbsp;that allows users to run programs as another user with different permissions. The goal is to escalate privileges and execute itself with administrative access, thereby effectively bypassing security measures to harvest wide swathes of data. That said, Microsoft's access control mitigations to prevent unauthorized execution of the tool means an attempt to run the malware binary as an administrator requires providing the necessary credentials.

"This recent update demonstrates a widening of scope, with new capabilities such the ability to compromise SSH servers and retrieve additional AWS-specific credentials from Laravel web applications," Cado Labs researcher Matt Muir&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "It's clear that the developer's targeting of cloud services is advancing with each iteration." Legion, a Python-based hack tool, was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;last month by the cloud security firm, detailing its ability to breach vulnerable SMTP servers in order to harvest credentials. It's also known to exploit web servers running content management systems (CMS), leverage Telegram as a data exfiltration point, and send spam SMS messages to a list of dynamically-generated U.S. mobile num

New WinTapix.sys Malware Engages in Multi-Stage Attack Across Middle East<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/new-wintapixsys-malware-engages-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor has been observed leveraging a malicious Windows kernel driver in attacks likely targeting the Middle East since at least May 2020. Fortinet Fortiguard Labs, which dubbed the artifact WINTAPIX (WinTapix.sys), attributed the malware with low confidence to an Iranian threat actor. "WinTapix.sys is essentially a loader," security researchers Geri Revay and Hossein Jazi said in a report published on Monday. "Thus, its primary purpose is to produce and execute the next stage of the attack. This is done using a shellcode." Samples and telemetry data analyzed by Fortinet show that the campaign's primary focus is on Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The activity has not been tied to a known threat actor or group. By using a malicious kernel mode driver, the idea is to subvert or disable security mechanisms and gain entrenched access to the targeted host. Such drivers run within the kernel memory and can, there

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A proof-of-concept (PoC) has been made available for a security flaw impacting the KeePass password manager that could be exploited to recover a victim's master password in cleartext under specific circumstances. The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2023-32784 , impacts KeePass versions 2.x for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and is&nbsp; expected to be patched &nbsp;in version 2.54, which is likely to be released early next month. "Apart from the first password character, it is mostly able to recover the password in plaintext," security researcher "vdohney," who discovered the flaw and devised a PoC,&nbsp; said . "No code execution on the target system is required, just a memory dump." "It doesn't matter where the memory comes from," the researcher added, stating, "it doesn't matter whether or not the workspace is locked. It is also possible to dump the password from RAM after KeePass is no longer running, although the chance of that working goes down w

The identity of the second threat actor behind the Golden Chickens malware has been uncovered courtesy of a "fatal" operational security blunder, cybersecurity firm eSentire said.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two malicious packages discovered in the npm package repository have been found to conceal an open source information stealer malware called&nbsp; TurkoRat . The packages – named nodejs-encrypt-agent and nodejs-cookie-proxy-agent – were collectively downloaded approximately 1,200 times and were available for more than two months before they were identified and taken down. ReversingLabs, which broke down the details of the campaign, described TurkoRat as an information stealer capable of harvesting sensitive information such as login credentials, website cookies, and data from cryptocurrency wallets.&nbsp; While nodejs-encrypt-agent came fitted with the malware inside, nodejs-cookie-proxy-agent was found to disguise the trojan as a dependency under the name axios-proxy. nodejs-encrypt-agent was also engineered to masquerade as another legitimate npm module known as&nbsp; agent-base , which has been downloaded over 25 million times to date.

The threat actors behind the CopperStealer malware resurfaced with two new campaigns in March and April 2023 that are designed to deliver two novel payloads dubbed CopperStealth and CopperPhish. Trend Micro is tracking the financially motivated group under the name&nbsp; Water Orthrus . The adversary is also assessed to be&nbsp; behind &nbsp; another campaign &nbsp;known as&nbsp; Scranos , which was detailed by Bitdefender in 2019.

Poorly managed Microsoft SQL (MS SQL) servers are the target of a new campaign that's designed to propagate a category of malware called&nbsp; CLR SqlShell &nbsp;that ultimately facilitates the deployment of cryptocurrency miners and ransomware. "Similar to web shell, which can be installed on web servers, SqlShell is a malware strain that supports various features after being installed on an MS SQL server, such as executing commands from threat actors and carrying out all sorts of malicious behavior," AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. A stored procedure is a subroutine that contains a set of Structured Query Language (SQL) statements for use across multiple programs in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government organizations in Central Asia are the target of a sophisticated espionage campaign that leverages a previously undocumented strain of malware dubbed&nbsp; DownEx . Bitdefender, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News, said the activity remains active, with evidence likely pointing to the involvement of Russia-based threat actors. The Romanian cybersecurity firm said it first detected the malware in a highly targeted attack aimed at foreign government institutions in Kazakhstan in late 2022. Subsequently, another attack was observed in Afghanistan. The use of a diplomat-themed lure document and the campaign's focus on data exfiltration suggests the involvement of a state-sponsored group, although the exact identity of the hacking outfit remains indeterminate at this stage. The initial intrusion vector for the campaign is suspected to be a spear-phishing email bearing a booby-trapped payload, which is a loader executable that masquerades as a Microsoft Word file. Openi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Various sectors in East Asian markets have been subjected to a new email phishing campaign that distributes a previously undocumented strain of Android malware called&nbsp; FluHorse &nbsp;that abuses the Flutter software development framework. "The malware features several malicious Android applications that mimic legitimate applications, most of which have more than 1,000,000 installs," Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report.

The malicious apps have been found to&nbsp;imitate popular apps like ETC and VPBank Neo, which are widely used in Taiwan and Vietnam. Evidence gathered so far shows that the activity has been active since at least May 2022.&nbsp; The phishing scheme in itself is fairly straightforward, wherein victims are lured with emails that contain links to a bogus website that hosts malicious APK files.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Android subscription malware named&nbsp; Fleckpe &nbsp;has been unearthed on the Google Play Store, amassing more than 620,000 downloads in total since 2022. Kaspersky, which identified 11 apps on the official app storefront, said the malware masqueraded as legitimate photo editing apps, camera, and smartphone wallpaper packs. The apps have since been taken down. The operation primarily targets users from Thailand, although telemetry data gathered by the Russian cybersecurity firm has revealed victims in Poland, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore. The apps further offer the promised functionality to avoid raising red flags, but conceal their real purpose under the hood.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Android surveillanceware possibly used by the Iranian government has been used to spy on over 300 individuals belonging to minority groups. The malware, dubbed&nbsp; BouldSpy , has been attributed with moderate confidence to the Law Enforcement Command of the Islamic Republic of Iran ( FARAJA ). Targeted victims include Iranian Kurds, Baluchis, Azeris, and Armenian Christian groups. "The spyware may also have been used in efforts to counter and monitor illegal trafficking activity related to arms, drugs, and alcohol," Lookout&nbsp; said , based on exfiltrated data that contained photos of drugs, firearms, and official documents issued by FARAJA.&nbsp; BouldSpy, like other Android malware families, abuses its access to Android's accessibility services and other intrusive permissions to harvest sensitive data such as web browser history, photos, contact lists, SMS logs, keystrokes, screenshots, clipboard content, microphone audio, and video call recordings.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In yet another instance of how threat actors are abusing Google Ads to serve malware, a threat actor has been observed leveraging the technique to deliver a new Windows-based financial trojan and information stealer called LOBSHOT . "LOBSHOT continues to collect victims while staying under the radar," Elastic Security Labs researcher Daniel Stepanic said in an analysis published last week. "One of LOBSHOT's core capabilities is around its hVNC (Hidden Virtual Network Computing) component. These kinds of modules allow for direct and unobserved access to the machine." The American-Dutch company attributed the malware strain to a threat actor known as&nbsp; TA505 &nbsp;based on infrastructure historically connected to the group. TA505 is a financially motivated e-crime syndicate that overlaps with&nbsp; activity clusters &nbsp;tracked under the names Evil Corp, FIN11, and Indrik Spider.

New Decoy Dog Malware Toolkit Uncovered: Targeting Enterprise Networks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/new-decoy-dog-malware-toolkit-uncovered.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of over 70 billion DNS records has led to the discovery of a new sophisticated malware toolkit dubbed&nbsp; Decoy Dog &nbsp;targeting enterprise networks. Decoy Dog , as the name implies, is evasive and employs techniques like strategic domain aging and DNS query dribbling, wherein a series of queries are transmitted to the command-and-control (C2) domains so as to not arouse any suspicion. "Decoy Dog is a cohesive toolkit with a number of highly unusual characteristics that make it uniquely identifiable, particularly when examining its domains on a DNS level," Infoblox&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published late last month. The cybersecurity firm, which identified the malware in early April 2023 following anomalous DNS beaconing activity, said its atypical characteristics allowed it to map additional domains that are part of the attack infrastructure. That said, the usage of Decoy Dog in the wild is "very rare," with the DNS signature matching less than 0.0000027%

Google disclosed that its improved security features and app review processes helped it block 1.43 million bad apps from being published to the Play Store in 2022. In addition, the company said it banned 173,000 bad accounts and fended off over $2 billion in fraudulent and abusive transactions through&nbsp; developer-facing features &nbsp;like Voided Purchases API, Obfuscated Account ID, and Play Integrity API. The addition of identity verification methods such as phone number and email address to join Google Play contributed to a reduction in accounts used to publish apps that go against its policies, Google pointed out. The search behemoth further said it "prevented about 500K submitted apps from unnecessarily accessing sensitive permissions over the past 3 years." "In 2022, the&nbsp; App Security Improvements program &nbsp;helped developers fix ~500K security weaknesses affecting ~300K apps with a combined install base of approximately 250B installs," it&nbsp; noted .

A significant number of victims in the consumer and enterprise sectors located across Australia, Japan, the U.S., and India have been affected by an evasive information-stealing malware called&nbsp; ViperSoftX . ViperSoftX was first documented by Fortinet in 2020, with cybersecurity company Avast detailing a campaign in November 2022 that&nbsp; leveraged &nbsp;the malware to distribute a malicious Google Chrome extension capable of siphoning cryptocurrencies from wallet applications. Now a&nbsp; new analysis &nbsp;from Trend Micro has revealed the malware's adoption of "more sophisticated encryption and basic anti-analysis techniques, such as byte remapping and web browser communication blocking." The arrival vector of ViperSoftX is typically a software crack or a key generator (keygen), while also employing actual non-malicious software like multimedia editors and system cleaner apps as "carriers."

Remote Access Trojans (RATs) have taken the third leading position in ANY. RUN's&nbsp; Q1 2023 report &nbsp;on the most prevalent malware types, making it highly probable that your organization may face this threat. Though LimeRAT might not be the most well-known RAT family, its versatility is what sets it apart. Capable of carrying out a broad spectrum of malicious activities, it excels not only in data exfiltration, but also in creating DDoS botnets and facilitating crypto mining. Its compact footprint allows it to elude endpoint detection systems, making it a stealthy adversary. Interestingly, LimeRAT shares similarities with njRAT, which ANY.RUN ranks as the third most popular malware family in terms of uploads during Q1 2023. ANY.RUN researchers have recently conducted an in-depth analysis of a LimeRAT sample and successfully extracted its configuration. In this article, we'll provide a brief overview of that analysis.

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the inner workings of a highly evasive loader named " in2al5d p3in4er " (read: invalid printer) that's used to deliver the Aurora information stealer malware. "The in2al5d p3in4er loader is compiled with&nbsp; Embarcadero RAD Studio &nbsp;and targets endpoint workstations using advanced anti-VM (virtual machine) technique," cybersecurity firm Morphisec&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. Aurora &nbsp;is a Go-based information stealer that emerged on the threat landscape in late 2022. Offered as a commodity malware to other actors, it's distributed through&nbsp; YouTube videos &nbsp;and SEO-poised fake cracked software download websites. Clicking the links present in YouTube video descriptions redirects the victim to decoy websites where they are enticed into downloading the malware under the garb of a seemingly-legitimate utility.

An emerging Python-based credential harvester and a hacking tool named Legion is being marketed via Telegram as a way for threat actors to break into various online services for further exploitation. Legion, according to&nbsp; Cado Labs , includes modules to enumerate vulnerable SMTP servers, conduct remote code execution (RCE) attacks, exploit unpatched versions of Apache, and brute-force cPanel and WebHost Manager (WHM) accounts. The malware is said to bear similarities to another malware family called AndroxGh0st that was first documented by cloud security services provider Lacework in December 2022. Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, in an analysis published late last month, revealed that AndroxGh0st is part of a comprehensive toolset called AlienFox that's offered to threat actors to steal API keys and secrets from cloud services.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors using hacking tools from an Israeli surveillanceware vendor named QuaDream targeted at least five members of civil society in North America, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. According to findings from a group of researchers from the Citizen Lab, the spyware campaign was directed against journalists, political opposition figures, and an NGO worker in 2021. The names of the victims were not disclosed. It's also suspected that the company abused a zero-click exploit dubbed&nbsp; ENDOFDAYS &nbsp;in iOS 14 to deploy spyware as a zero-day in version 14.4 and 14.4.2. There is no evidence that the exploit has been used after March 2021. ENDOFDAYS "appears to make use of invisible iCloud calendar invitations sent from the spyware's operator to victims," the researchers said , adding the .ics files contain invites to two backdated and overlapping events so as to not alert the users.&nbsp; The attacks are suspected to have leveraged a quirk in iOS 1

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the inner workings of the cryptocurrency stealer malware that was distributed via 13 malicious NuGet packages as part of a supply chain attack targeting .NET developers. The sophisticated typosquatting campaign, which was&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;by JFrog late last month, impersonated legitimate packages to execute PowerShell code designed to retrieve a follow-on binary from a hard-coded server. The&nbsp; two-stage attack &nbsp;culminates in the deployment of a .NET-based persistent backdoor, called Impala Stealer, which is capable of gaining unauthorized access to users' cryptocurrency accounts. "The payload used a very rare obfuscation technique, called '.NET AoT compilation,' which is a lot more stealthy than using 'off the shelf' obfuscators while still making the binary hard to reverse engineer," JFrog told The Hacker News in a statement. .NET&nbsp; AoT compilation &nbsp;is an&nbsp; optimization technique &nbsp;that allows apps to be ahead-of-time c

The activity leverages SEO poisoning techniques to entice users searching for "WhatsApp web" to rogue domains hosting the malware, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today.&nbsp; CryptoClippy, a C-based executable, is a type of&nbsp; cryware &nbsp;known as&nbsp; clipper &nbsp; malware &nbsp;that monitors a victim's clipboard for content matching cryptocurrency addresses and substituting them with a wallet address under the threat actor's control. "The clipper malware uses regular expressions (regexes) to identify what type of cryptocurrency the address pertains to," Unit 42 researchers said. "It then replaces the clipboard entry with a visually similar but adversary-controlled wallet address for the appropriate cryptocurrency. Later, when the victim pastes the address from the clipboard to condu

Typhon Reborn Stealer Malware Resurfaces with Advanced Evasion Techniques<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/typhon-reborn-stealer-malware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor behind the information-stealing malware known as&nbsp; Typhon Reborn &nbsp;has resurfaced with an updated version (V2) that packs in improved capabilities to evade detection and resist analysis. The new version is offered for sale on the criminal underground for $59 per month, $360 per year, or alternatively, for $540 for a lifetime subscription. "The stealer can harvest and exfiltrate sensitive information and uses the Telegram API to send stolen data to attackers," Cisco Talos researcher Edmund Brumaghin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. Typhon was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Cyble in August 2022, detailing its myriad features, including hijacking clipboard content, capturing screenshots, logging keystrokes, and stealing data from crypto wallet, messaging, FTP, VPN, browser, and gaming apps. Based on another stealer malware called&nbsp; Prynt Stealer , Typhon is also capable of delivering the XMRig cryptocurrency miner. In November 2022, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42&nbsp; unearthed &nbsp;an

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Chromium-based web browsers are the target of a new malware called Rilide that masquerades itself as a seemingly legitimate extension to harvest sensitive data and siphon cryptocurrency. "Rilide malware is disguised as a legitimate Google Drive extension and enables threat actors to carry out a broad spectrum of malicious activities, including monitoring&nbsp; browsing history, taking screenshots, and injecting malicious scripts to withdraw funds from various cryptocurrency exchanges," Trustwave SpiderLabs Research said in a report shared with The Hacker News. What's more, the stealer malware can display forged dialogs to deceive users into entering a two-factor authentication code to withdraw digital assets. Trustwave said it identified two different campaigns involving&nbsp; Ekipa RAT &nbsp;and&nbsp; Aurora Stealer &nbsp;that led to the installation of the malicious browser extension. While Ekipa RAT is distributed via booby-trapped Microsoft Publisher files, rogue Google Ads act as t

Crypto-Stealing OpcJacker Malware Targets Users with Fake VPN Service<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/crypto-stealing-opcjacker-malware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A piece of new information-stealing malware called&nbsp; OpcJacker &nbsp;has been spotted in the wild since the second half of 2022 as part of a malvertising campaign. "OpcJacker's main functions include keylogging, taking screenshots, stealing sensitive data from browsers, loading additional modules, and replacing cryptocurrency addresses in the clipboard for hijacking purposes," Trend Micro researchers Jaromir Horejsi and Joseph C. Chen&nbsp; said . The initial vector of the campaign involves a network of fake websites advertising seemingly innocuous software and cryptocurrency-related applications. The February 2023 campaign specifically singled out users in Iran under the pretext of offering a VPN service. The installer files act as a conduit to deploy OpcJacker, which is also capable of delivering next-stage payloads such as&nbsp; NetSupport RAT &nbsp;and a hidden virtual network computing ( hVNC ) variant for remote access. OpcJacker is concealed using a&nbsp; crypter &nbsp;known as Babadeda an

A new "comprehensive toolset" called&nbsp; AlienFox &nbsp;is being distributed on Telegram as a way for threat actors to harvest credentials from API keys and secrets from popular cloud service providers.

The cybersecurity company characterized the malware as highly modular and constantly evolving to accommodate new features and performance improvements. The primary use of AlienFox is to enumerate misconfigured hosts via scanning platforms like&nbsp; LeakIX &nbsp;and&nbsp; SecurityTrails , and subsequently leverage various scripts in the toolkit to extract credentials from configuration files exposed on the servers.

An unknown Chinese state-sponsored hacking group has been linked to a novel piece of malware aimed at Linux servers. French cybersecurity firm ExaTrack, which found three samples of the previously documented malicious software that date back to early 2022, dubbed it&nbsp; Mélofée . One of the artifacts is designed to drop a kernel-mode rootkit that's based on an open source project referred to as&nbsp; Reptile . "According to the vermagic metadata, it is compiled for a kernel version 5.10.112-108.499.amzn2.x86_64," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "The rootkit has a limited set of features, mainly installing a hook designed for hiding itself." Both the implant and the rootkit are said to be deployed using shell commands that download an installer and a custom binary package from a remote server. The installer takes the binary package as an argument and then extracts the rootkit as well as a server implant module that's currently under active development. Mélofé

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple threat actors have been observed using two new variants of the&nbsp; IcedID malware &nbsp;in the wild with more limited functionality that removes functionality related to online banking fraud. IcedID, also known as BokBot, started off as a banking trojan in 2017. It's also capable of delivering additional malware, including ransomware. "The well-known IcedID version consists of an initial loader which contacts a Loader [command-and-control] server, downloads the standard DLL Loader, which then delivers the standard IcedID Bot," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published Monday. One of the new versions is a Lite variant that was&nbsp; previously highlighted &nbsp;as being dropped as a follow-on payload by the&nbsp; Emotet malware &nbsp;in November 2022. Also newly observed in February 2023 is a Forked variant of IcedID.

A new information-stealing malware has set its sights on Apple's macOS operating system to siphon sensitive information from compromised devices.

First advertised on online hacking forums at the start of the month, it is still a work in progress, with the malware authors planning to add features to capture data from Apple's Safari browser and the Notes app. In its current form, MacStealer is designed to extract iCloud Keychain data, passwords and credit card information from browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Brave.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious Python package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository has been found to use Unicode as a trick to evade detection and deploy an info-stealing malware. The package in question, named&nbsp; onyxproxy , was uploaded to PyPI on March 15, 2023, and comes with capabilities to harvest and exfiltrate credentials and other valuable data. It has since been taken down, but not before attracting a total of&nbsp; 183 downloads . According to software supply chain security firm Phylum, the package incorporates its malicious behavior in a setup script that's packed with thousands of seemingly legitimate code strings. These strings include a mix of bold and italic fonts and are still readable and can be parsed by the Python interpreter, only to activate the execution of the stealer malware upon installation of the package.&nbsp; "An obvious and immediate benefit of this strange scheme is readability," the company&nbsp; noted .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has stepped in to remove a bogus Chrome browser extension from the official Web Store that masqueraded as OpenAI's ChatGPT service to harvest Facebook session cookies and hijack the accounts. The "ChatGPT For Google" extension, a trojanized version of a&nbsp; legitimate open source browser add-on , attracted over 9,000 installations since March 14, 2023, prior to its removal. It was originally uploaded to the Chrome Web Store on February 14, 2023. According to&nbsp; Guardio Labs &nbsp;researcher Nati Tal, the extension is propagated through&nbsp; malicious &nbsp; sponsored Google search results &nbsp;that are designed to redirect unsuspecting users searching for "Chat GPT-4" to fraudulent landing pages that point to the fake add-on. Installing the extension adds the promised functionality – i.e., enhancing search engines with ChatGPT – but it also stealthily activates the ability to capture Facebook-related cookies and exfiltrate it to a remote server in an encrypted manner.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An emerging Android banking trojan dubbed&nbsp; Nexus &nbsp;has already been adopted by several threat actors to target 450 financial applications and conduct fraud. "Nexus appears to be in its early stages of development," Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. "Nexus provides all the main features to perform ATO attacks (Account Takeover) against banking portals and cryptocurrency services, such as credentials stealing and SMS interception." The trojan, which appeared in various hacking forums at the start of the year, is advertised as a subscription service to its clientele for a monthly fee of $3,000. Details of the malware were&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Cyble earlier this month. However, there are indications that the malware may have been used in real-world attacks as early as June 2022, at least six months before its official announcement on darknet portals.

ScarCruft's Evolving Arsenal: Researchers Reveal New Malware Distribution Techniques<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/scarcrufts-evolving-arsenal-researchers.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) actor dubbed ScarCruft is using weaponized Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) files to download additional malware. According to multiple reports from&nbsp; AhnLab Security Emergency response Center &nbsp;( ASEC ),&nbsp; SEKOIA.IO , and&nbsp; Zscaler , the development is illustrative of the group's continuous efforts to refine and retool its tactics to sidestep detection. "The group is constantly evolving its tools, techniques, and procedures while experimenting with new file formats and methods to bypass security vendors," Zscaler researchers Sudeep Singh and Naveen Selvan said in a new analysis published Tuesday.&nbsp; ScarCruft, also tracked under the names APT37, Reaper, RedEyes, and Ricochet Chollima, has exhibited an increased operational tempo since the start of the year, targeting various South Korean entities for espionage purposes. It is known to be active since at least 2012. Last month, ASEC&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a campaign that employed

Rogue NuGet Packages Infect .NET Developers with Crypto-Stealing Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/rogue-nuget-packages-infect-net.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The&nbsp; NuGet &nbsp;repository is the target of a new "sophisticated and highly-malicious attack" aiming to infect .NET developer systems with cryptocurrency stealer malware. The 13 rogue packages, which were downloaded more than 160,000 times over the past month, have since been taken down. "The packages contained a PowerShell script that would execute upon installation and trigger a download of a 'second stage' payload, which could be remotely executed," JFrog researchers Natan Nehorai and Brian Moussalli&nbsp; said . While NuGet packages have been in the past found to&nbsp; contain vulnerabilities &nbsp;and be abused to&nbsp; propagate phishing links , the development marks the first-ever discovery of packages with malicious code. Three of the most downloaded packages – Coinbase.Core, Anarchy.Wrapper.Net, and DiscordRichPresence.API – alone accounted for 166,000 downloads, although it's also possible that the threat actors artificially inflated the download counts using bo

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat group tracked as&nbsp; REF2924 &nbsp;has been observed deploying previously unseen malware in its attacks aimed at entities in South and Southeast Asia. The malware, dubbed&nbsp; NAPLISTENER &nbsp;by Elastic Security Labs, is an HTTP listener programmed in C# and is designed to evade "network-based forms of detection." REF2924 &nbsp;is the moniker assigned to an activity cluster linked to attacks against an entity in Afghanistan as well as the Foreign Affairs Office of an ASEAN member in 2022. The threat actor's modus operandi suggests overlaps with another hacking group dubbed&nbsp; ChamelGang , which was documented by Russian cybersecurity company Positive Technologies in October 2021. Attacks orchestrated by the group are said to have exploited internet-exposed Microsoft Exchange servers to&nbsp; deploy backdoors &nbsp;such as DOORME, SIESTAGRAPH, and ShadowPad.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious Emotet malware, in its&nbsp; return after a short hiatus , is now being distributed via&nbsp; Microsoft OneNote email attachments &nbsp;in an attempt to bypass macro-based security restrictions and compromise systems. Emotet , linked to a threat actor tracked as Gold Crestwood, Mummy Spider, or TA542, continues to be a potent and resilient threat despite attempts by law enforcement to take it down. A&nbsp; derivative &nbsp;of the&nbsp; Cridex &nbsp; banking worm &nbsp;– which was&nbsp; subsequently &nbsp; replaced &nbsp;by&nbsp; Dridex &nbsp;around the same time GameOver Zeus was disrupted in 2014 – Emotet has&nbsp; evolved &nbsp;into a "monetized platform for other threat actors to run malicious campaigns on a pay-per-install (PPI) model, allowing theft of sensitive data and ransom extortion." While Emotet infections have acted as a&nbsp; conduit &nbsp;to deliver Cobalt Strike, IcedID, Qakbot, Quantum ransomware, and TrickBot, its return in late 2021 was&nbsp; facilitated &nbsp;by means of TrickBot.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A fake ChatGPT-branded Chrome browser extension has been found to come with capabilities to hijack Facebook accounts and create rogue admin accounts, highlighting one of the different methods cyber criminals are using to distribute malware. "By hijacking high-profile Facebook business accounts, the threat actor creates an elite army of Facebook bots and a malicious paid media apparatus," Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors have been increasingly observed using AI-generated YouTube Videos to spread a variety of stealer malware such as Raccoon, RedLine, and Vidar. "The videos lure users by pretending to be tutorials on how to download cracked versions of software such as Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Autodesk 3ds Max, AutoCAD, and other products that are licensed products available only to paid users," CloudSEK researcher Pavan Karthick M&nbsp; said . Just as the ransomware landscape comprises core developers and affiliates who are in charge of identifying potential targets and actually carrying out the attacks, the information stealer ecosystem also consists of threat actors known as&nbsp; traffers &nbsp;who are recruited to spread the malware using different methods. One of the popular malware distribution channels is YouTube, with CloudSEK witnessing a 200-300% month-over-month increase in videos containing links to stealer malware in the description section.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The malware downloader known as BATLOADER has been observed&nbsp; abusing Google Ads &nbsp;to deliver secondary payloads like Vidar Stealer and Ursnif. According to cybersecurity company&nbsp; eSentire , malicious ads are used to spoof a wide range of legitimate apps and services such as Adobe, OpenAPI's ChatGPT, Spotify, Tableau, and Zoom. BATLOADER , as the name suggests, is a loader that's responsible for distributing next-stage malware such as information stealers, banking malware, Cobalt Strike, and even ransomware. One of the key traits of the BATLOADER operations is the use of software impersonation tactics for malware delivery. This is achieved by setting up lookalike websites that host Windows installer files masquerading as legitimate apps to trigger the infection sequence when a user searching for the software clicks a rogue ad on the Google search results page. These MSI installer files, when launched, execute Python scripts that contain the BATLOADER payload to retrieve t

A new variant of the Android banking trojan named Xenomorph has surfaced in the wild, latest findings from ThreatFabric reveal.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An older version of Shein's&nbsp; Android application &nbsp;suffered from a bug that periodically captured and transmitted clipboard contents to a remote server. The Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team said it&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;the problem in&nbsp; version 7.9.2 &nbsp;of the app that was released on December 16, 2021.

The app, which is currently at version 9.0.0, has over 100 million downloads on the Google Play Store. The tech giant&nbsp; said &nbsp;it's not "specifically aware of any malicious intent behind the behavior," but noted that the function isn't necessary to perform tasks on the app. It further pointed out that launching the application after copying any content to the device clipboard automatically triggered an HTTP POST request containing the data to the server "api-service[.]shein[.]com."

New HiatusRAT Malware Targets Business-Grade Routers to Covertly Spy on Victims<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/new-hiatusrat-malware-targets-business.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A never-before-seen complex malware is targeting business-grade routers to covertly spy on victims in Latin America, Europe, and North America at least since July 2022. The elusive campaign, dubbed&nbsp; Hiatus &nbsp;by Lumen Black Lotus Labs, has been found to deploy two malicious binaries, a remote access trojan dubbed HiatusRAT and a&nbsp; variant of tcpdump &nbsp;that makes it possible to capture packet capture on the target device. "Once a targeted system is infected, HiatusRAT allows the threat actor to remotely interact with the system, and it utilizes prebuilt functionality [...] to convert the compromised machine into a covert proxy for the threat actor," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "The packet-capture binary enables the actor to monitor router traffic on ports associated with email and file-transfer communications." The threat cluster primarily singles out end-of-life (EoL) DrayTek Vigor router models 2960 and 3900, with approximately 100

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new ATM malware strain dubbed&nbsp; FiXS &nbsp;has been observed targeting Mexican banks since the start of February 2023. "The ATM malware is hidden inside another not-malicious-looking program," Latin American cybersecurity firm Metabase Q&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. Besides requiring interaction via an external keyboard, the Windows-based ATM malware is also vendor-agnostic and is capable of infecting any teller machine that supports&nbsp; CEN/XFS &nbsp;(short for eXtensions for Financial Services). The exact mode of compromise remains unknown but Metabase Q's Dan Regalado told The Hacker News that it's likely that "attackers found a way to interact with the ATM via touchscreen." FiXS is also said to be similar to another strain of&nbsp; ATM malware &nbsp;codenamed&nbsp; Ploutus &nbsp;that has enabled cybercriminals to extract cash from ATMs by using an external keyboard or by&nbsp; sending an SMS message . One of the notable characteristics of FiXS is its ability to disp

The threat actor known as&nbsp; Lucky Mouse &nbsp;has developed a Linux version of a malware toolkit called SysUpdate, expanding on its ability to target devices running the operating system. The oldest version of the updated artifact dates back to July 2022, with the malware incorporating new features designed to evade security software and resist reverse engineering. Cybersecurity company Trend Micro&nbsp; said &nbsp;it observed the equivalent Windows variant in June 2022, nearly one month after the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure was set up. Lucky Mouse is also&nbsp; tracked &nbsp;under the monikers APT27, Bronze Union, Emissary Panda, and Iron Tiger, and is known to utilize a variety of malware such as&nbsp; SysUpdate , HyperBro, PlugX, and a Linux backdoor dubbed rshell. Over the past two years, campaigns orchestrated by the threat group have embraced supply chain compromises of legitimate apps like&nbsp; Able Desktop &nbsp;and&nbsp; MiMi Chat &nbsp;to obtain remote access to compromised systems.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A stealthy Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) bootkit called BlackLotus has become the first publicly known malware capable of bypassing Secure Boot defenses, making it a potent threat in the cyber landscape. "This bootkit can run even on fully up-to-date Windows 11 systems with UEFI Secure Boot enabled," Slovak cybersecurity company ESET&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. UEFI bootkits &nbsp;are deployed in the system firmware and allow full control over the operating system (OS) boot process, thereby making it possible to disable OS-level security mechanisms and deploy arbitrary payloads during startup with high privileges. Offered for sale at $5,000 (and $200 per new subsequent version), the powerful and persistent toolkit is programmed in Assembly and C and is 80 kilobytes in size. It also features geofencing capabilities to avoid infecting computers in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine. Details about BlackLotus&nbsp; f

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cryptocurrency companies are being targeted as part of a new campaign that delivers a remote access trojan called Parallax RAT. The malware "uses injection techniques to hide within legitimate processes, making it difficult to detect," Uptycs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "Once it has been successfully injected, attackers can interact with their victim via Windows Notepad that likely serves as a communication channel." Parallax RAT &nbsp;grants attackers remote access to victim machines. It comes with features to upload and download files as well as record keystrokes and screen captures. It has been put to use since early 2020 and was&nbsp; previously delivered &nbsp;via COVID-19-themed lures. In February 2022, Proofpoint&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;an activity cluster dubbed TA2541 targeting aviation, aerospace, transportation, manufacturing, and defense industries using different RATs, including Parallax.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The RIG exploit kit (EK) touched an all-time high successful exploitation rate of nearly 30% in 2022, new findings reveal. "RIG EK is a financially-motivated program that has been active since 2014," Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an exhaustive report shared with The Hacker News. "Although it has yet to substantially change its exploits in its more recent activity, the type and version of the malware they distribute constantly change. The frequency of updating samples ranges from weekly to daily updates." Exploit kits are programs used to distribute malware to large numbers of victims by taking advantage of known security flaws in commonly-used software such as web browsers. The fact that&nbsp; RIG EK &nbsp;runs as a service model means threat actors can financially compensate the RIG EK administrator for installing malware of their choice on victim machines. The RIG EK operators primarily employ malvertising to ensure a high infection rate and large-scale

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new information stealer called&nbsp; Stealc &nbsp;that's being advertised on the dark web could emerge as a worthy competitor to other malware of its ilk. "The threat actor presents Stealc as a fully featured and ready-to-use stealer, whose development relied on&nbsp; Vidar ,&nbsp; Raccoon ,&nbsp; Mars , and&nbsp; RedLine &nbsp;stealers," SEKOIA&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday report. The French cybersecurity company said it&nbsp; discovered &nbsp; more than &nbsp; 40 Stealc samples &nbsp;distributed in the wild and 35 active command-and-control (C2) servers, suggesting that the malware is already gaining traction among criminal groups. Stealc, first marketed by an actor named Plymouth on the XSS and BHF Russian-speaking underground forums on January 9, 2023, is written in C and comes with capabilities to steal data from web browsers, crypto wallets, email clients, and messaging apps. The malware-as-a-service (MaaS) also boasts of a "customizable" file grabber that allows its buyers to tailor the module to siphon files o

A spear-phishing campaign targeting Indian government entities aims to deploy an updated version of a backdoor called ReverseRAT . Cybersecurity firm ThreatMon&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the activity to a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; SideCopy . SideCopy is a threat group of Pakistani origin that shares overlaps with another actor called&nbsp; Transparent Tribe . It is so named for mimicking the infection chains associated with&nbsp; SideWinder &nbsp;to deliver its own malware. The adversarial crew was first observed delivering ReverseRAT in 2021, when Lumen's Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;a set of attacks targeting victims aligned with the government and power utility verticals in India and Afghanistan. Recent attack campaigns associated with SideCopy have primarily&nbsp; set their sights &nbsp;on a two-factor authentication solution known as Kavach (meaning "armor" in Hindi) that's used by Indian government officials.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Suspected North Korean nation-state actors targeted a journalist in South Korea with a malware-laced Android app as part of a social engineering campaign. The findings come from South Korea-based non-profit Interlab, which coined the new malware&nbsp; RambleOn . The malicious functionalities include the "ability to read and leak target's contact list, SMS, voice call content, location and others from the time of compromise on the target," Interlab threat researcher Ovi Liber&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. The spyware camouflages as a secure chat app called&nbsp; Fizzle &nbsp;(ch.seme), but in reality, acts as a conduit to deliver a next-stage payload hosted on pCloud and Yandex. The chat app is said to have been sent as an Android Package (APK) file over WeChat to the targeted journalist on December 7, 2022, under the pretext of wanting to discuss a sensitive topic. The primary purpose of RambleOn is to function as a loader for another APK file ( com.data.WeCoin ) while

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a new piece of evasive malware dubbed&nbsp; Beep &nbsp;that's designed to fly under the radar and drop additional payloads onto a compromised host. "It seemed as if the authors of this malware were trying to implement as many anti-debugging and anti-VM (anti-sandbox) techniques as they could find," Minerva Labs researcher Natalie Zargarov&nbsp; said . "One such technique involved delaying execution through the use of the&nbsp; Beep API function , hence the malware's name." Beep comprises three components, the first of which is a dropper that's responsible for creating a new Windows Registry key and executing a Base64-encoded PowerShell script stored in it. The PowerShell script, for its part, reaches out to a remote server to retrieve an injector, which, after confirming it's not being debugged or launched in a virtual machine, extracts and launches the payload via a technique called&nbsp; process hollowing . The payload is an

Malicious actors have published more than 451 unique Python packages on the official Python Package Index (PyPI) repository in an attempt to infect developer systems with&nbsp; clipper malware . Software supply chain security company Phylum, which&nbsp; spotted the libraries , said the ongoing activity is a follow-up to a campaign that was initially disclosed in November 2022. The initial vector entails using&nbsp; typosquatting &nbsp;to mimic popular packages such as beautifulsoup, bitcoinlib, cryptofeed, matplotlib, pandas, pytorch, scikit-learn, scrapy, selenium, solana, and tensorflow, among others. "After installation, a malicious JavaScript file is dropped to the system and executed in the background of any web browsing session," Phylum&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last year. "When a developer copies a cryptocurrency address, the address is replaced in the clipboard with the attacker's address." This is achieved by creating a Chromium web browser extension in the Window

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Four different rogue packages in the Python Package Index ( PyPI ) have been found to carry out a number of malicious actions, including dropping malware, deleting the netstat utility, and manipulating the SSH authorized_keys file. The packages in question are&nbsp; aptx ,&nbsp; bingchilling2 ,&nbsp; httops , and&nbsp; tkint3rs , all of which were collectively downloaded about 450 times before they were taken down. While aptx is an attempt to impersonate Qualcomm's&nbsp; highly popular audio codec &nbsp;of the same name, httops and tkint3rs are typosquats of https and tkinter, respectively. "Most of these packages had well thought out names, to purposely confuse people," Security researcher and journalist Ax Sharma&nbsp; said . An analysis of the malicious code injected in the setup script reveals the presence of an obfuscated&nbsp; Meterpreter payload &nbsp;that's disguised as " pip ," a legitimate package installer for Python, and can be leveraged to gain shell access to the infected host.

The Gootkit malware is prominently going after healthcare and finance organizations in the U.S., U.K., and Australia, according to new findings from Cybereason. The cybersecurity firm said it investigated a Gootkit incident in December 2022 that adopted a new method of deployment, with the actors abusing the foothold to deliver&nbsp; Cobalt Strike &nbsp;and&nbsp; SystemBC &nbsp;for post-exploitation. "The threat actor displayed fast-moving behaviors, quickly heading to control the network it infected, and getting elevated privileges in less than 4 hours," Cybereason&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published February 8, 2023. Gootkit, also called Gootloader, is exclusively attributed to a threat actor tracked by Mandiant as UNC2565. Starting its life in 2014 as a banking trojan, the malware has since morphed into a loader capable of delivering next-stage payloads. The shift in tactics was&nbsp; first uncovered &nbsp;by Sophos in March 2021. Gootloader takes the form of heavily-obfuscated JavaScript files that

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
E-commerce industries in South Korea and the U.S. are at the receiving end of an ongoing GuLoader malware campaign, cybersecurity firm Trellix disclosed late last month. The malspam activity is notable for transitioning away from malware-laced Microsoft Word documents to NSIS executable files for loading the malware. Other countries targeted as part of the campaign include Germany, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and Japan. NSIS , short for Nullsoft Scriptable Install System, is a script-driven open source system used to develop installers for the Windows operating system. While attack chains in 2021 leveraged a ZIP archive containing a macro-laced Word document to drop an executable file tasked with loading GuLoader, the new phishing wave employs NSIS files embedded within ZIP or ISO images to activate the infection.

An ongoing malvertising campaign is being used to distribute virtualized .NET loaders that are designed to deploy the FormBook information-stealing malware.

Post-Macro World Sees Rise in Microsoft OneNote Documents Delivering Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/post-macro-world-sees-rise-in-microsoft.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In a continuing sign that threat actors are adapting well to a&nbsp; post-macro world , it has emerged that the use of Microsoft OneNote documents to deliver malware via phishing attacks is on the rise. Some of the notable malware families that are being distributed using this method include AsyncRAT,&nbsp; RedLine Stealer , Agent Tesla,&nbsp; DOUBLEBACK , Quasar RAT, XWorm,&nbsp; Qakbot ,&nbsp; BATLOADER , and&nbsp; FormBook . Enterprise firm Proofpoint said it detected over 50 campaigns leveraging OneNote attachments in the month of January 2023 alone. In some instances, the email phishing lures contain a OneNote file, which, in turn, embeds an HTA file that invokes a PowerShell script to retrieve a malicious binary from a remote server. Other scenarios entail the execution of a rogue VBScript that's embedded within the OneNote document and concealed behind an image that appears as a seemingly harmless button. The VBScript, for its part, is designed to drop a PowerShell script to run DOUBLEBACK. "

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The State Cyber Protection Centre (SCPC) of Ukraine has called out the Russian state-sponsored threat actor known as&nbsp; Gamaredon &nbsp;for its targeted cyber attacks on public authorities and critical information infrastructure in the country. The advanced persistent threat, also known as Actinium, Armageddon, Iron Tilden, Primitive Bear, Shuckworm, Trident Ursa, and UAC-0010, has a&nbsp; track record &nbsp;of&nbsp; striking &nbsp; Ukrainian entities &nbsp;dating as far back as 2013. "UAC-0010 group's ongoing activity is characterized by a multi-step download approach and executing payloads of the spyware used to maintain control over infected hosts," the SCPC&nbsp; said . "For now, the UAC-0010 group uses&nbsp; GammaLoad and GammaSteel &nbsp;spyware in their campaigns." GammaLoad is a VBScript dropper malware engineered to download next-stage VBScript from a remote server.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new exploit has been devised to "unenroll" enterprise- or school-managed Chromebooks from administrative control. Enrolling ChromeOS devices makes it possible to enforce device policies as set by the organization via the&nbsp; Google Admin console , including the features that are available to users. "Each enrolled device complies with the policies you set until you wipe or deprovision it," Google&nbsp; states &nbsp;in its documentation. That's where the&nbsp; exploit &nbsp;– dubbed Shady Hacking 1nstrument Makes Machine Enrollment Retreat aka&nbsp; SH1MMER &nbsp;– comes in, allowing users to bypass these admin restrictions. The method is also a reference to shim, a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) disk image used by service center technicians to reinstall the operating system and run diagnosis and repair programs. The Google-signed&nbsp; shim image &nbsp;is a "combination of existing Chrome OS&nbsp; factory bundle &nbsp;components" – namely a release image, a toolkit, and the firmware, amon

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Brazilian threat actors behind an advanced and modular point-of-sale (PoS) malware known as&nbsp; Prilex &nbsp;have reared their head once again with new updates that allow it to block contactless payment transactions. Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;it detected three versions of Prilex (06.03.8080, 06.03.8072, and 06.03.8070) that are capable of targeting NFC-enabled credit cards, taking its criminal scheme a notch higher. Having evolved out of ATM-focused malware into PoS malware over the years since going operational in 2014, the threat actor steadily incorporated new features that are designed to facilitate credit card fraud, including a technique called&nbsp; GHOST transactions . While contactless payments have taken off in a big way, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the underlying motive behind the new functionality is to disable the feature so as to force the user to insert the card into the PIN pad. To that end, the latest version of Prilex, which Kaspersky discover

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Russia-affiliated Sandworm used yet another wiper malware strain dubbed&nbsp; NikoWiper &nbsp;as part of an attack that took place in October 2022 targeting an energy sector company in Ukraine. "The NikoWiper is based on&nbsp; SDelete , a command line utility from Microsoft that is used for securely deleting files," cybersecurity company ESET&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;in its latest APT Activity Report shared with The Hacker News. The Slovak cybersecurity firm said the attacks coincided with&nbsp; missile strikes &nbsp;orchestrated by the Russian armed forces aimed at the Ukrainian energy infrastructure, suggesting overlaps in objectives. The disclosure comes merely days after ESET attributed Sandworm to a Golang-based data wiper known as&nbsp; SwiftSlicer &nbsp;that was deployed against an unnamed Ukrainian entity on January 25, 2023.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A shellcode-based&nbsp; packer &nbsp;dubbed&nbsp; TrickGate &nbsp;has been successfully operating without attracting notice for over six years, while enabling threat actors to deploy a wide range of malware such as TrickBot, Emotet, AZORult, Agent Tesla, FormBook, Cerber, Maze, and REvil over the years. "TrickGate managed to stay under the radar for years because it is transformative – it undergoes changes periodically," Check Point Research's Arie Olshtein&nbsp; said , calling it a "master of disguises." Offered as a service to other threat actors since at least late 2016, TrickGate helps conceal payloads behind a layer of wrapper code in an attempt to get past security solutions installed on a host. Packers can also function as crypters by encrypting the malware as an obfuscation mechanism. "Packers have different features that allow them to circumvent detection mechanisms by appearing as benign files, being difficult to reverse engineer, or incorporating sandbox evasion tec

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a new attack campaign that leverages a Python-based remote access trojan (RAT) to gain control over compromised systems since at least August 2022. "This malware is unique in its utilization of&nbsp; WebSockets &nbsp;to avoid detection and for both command-and-control (C2) communication and exfiltration," Securonix&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. The malware, dubbed PY#RATION by the cybersecurity firm, comes with a host of capabilities that allows the threat actor to harvest sensitive information. Later versions of the backdoor also sport anti-evasion techniques, suggesting that it's being actively developed and maintained. The attack commences with a phishing email containing a ZIP archive, which, in turn, harbors two shortcut (.LNK) files that masquerade as front and back side images of a seemingly legitimate U.K. driver's license. Opening each of the .LNK files retrieves two text files from a remote server that a

The Emotet malware operation has continued to refine its tactics in an effort to fly under the radar, while also acting as a conduit for other dangerous malware such as Bumblebee and IcedID. Emotet, which officially&nbsp; reemerged &nbsp;in late 2021 following a coordinated takedown of its infrastructure by authorities earlier that year, has continued to be a persistent threat that's distributed via phishing emails. Attributed to a cybercrime group tracked as&nbsp; TA542 &nbsp;(aka Gold Crestwood or Mummy Spider), the virus has&nbsp; evolved &nbsp;from a banking trojan to a malware distributor since its first appearance in 2014. The malware-as-a-service (MaaS) is also modular, capable of deploying an array of proprietary and freeware components that can exfiltrate sensitive information from compromised machines and carry out other post-exploitation activities.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the Roaming Mantis attack campaign have been observed delivering an updated variant of their patent mobile malware known as Wroba to infiltrate Wi-Fi routers and undertake Domain Name System ( DNS ) hijacking. Kaspersky, which carried out an&nbsp; analysis &nbsp;of the malicious artifact, said the feature is designed to target specific Wi-Fi routers located in South Korea. Roaming Mantis, also known as Shaoye, is a long-running financially motivated operation that singles out Android smartphone users with malware capable of stealing bank account credentials as well as harvesting other kinds of sensitive information. Although primarily&nbsp; targeting the Asian region &nbsp;since 2018, the hacking crew was detected&nbsp; expanding &nbsp;its&nbsp; victim range &nbsp;to include France and Germany for the first time in early 2022 by camouflaging the malware as the Google Chrome web browser application. The attacks leverage smishing messages as the initial intrusion vector of choice to deliver

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor behind the&nbsp; BlackRock &nbsp;and&nbsp; ERMAC &nbsp;Android banking trojans has unleashed yet another malware for rent called&nbsp; Hook &nbsp;that introduces new capabilities to access files stored in the devices and create a remote interactive session. ThreatFabric, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News, characterized Hook as a novel ERMAC fork that's advertised for sale for $7,000 per month while featuring "all the capabilities of its predecessor." "In addition, it also adds to its arsenal Remote Access Tooling (RAT) capabilities, joining the ranks of families such as&nbsp; Octo &nbsp;and&nbsp; Hydra , which are capable performing a full Device Take Over (DTO), and complete a full fraud chain, from PII exfiltration to transaction, with all the intermediate steps, without the need of additional channels," the Dutch cybersecurity firm said.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing campaign dubbed&nbsp; Earth Bogle &nbsp;is leveraging geopolitical-themed lures to deliver the NjRAT remote access trojan to victims across the Middle East and North Africa. "The threat actor uses public cloud storage services such as files[.]fm and failiem[.]lv to host malware, while compromised web servers distribute NjRAT," Trend Micro&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Wednesday. Phishing emails, typically tailored to the victim's interests, are loaded with malicious attachments to activate the infection routine. This takes the form of a Microsoft Cabinet (CAB) archive file containing a Visual Basic Script dropper to deploy the next-stage payload. Alternatively, it's suspected that the files are distributed via social media platforms such as Facebook and Discord, in some cases even creating bogus accounts to serve ads on pages impersonating legitimate news outlets. The CAB files, hosted on cloud storage services, also masquerade as sensitive voice calls to entice

Users of Zoho ManageEngine are being urged to patch their instances against a critical security vulnerability ahead of the release of a proof-of-concept ( PoC ) exploit code. The issue in question is&nbsp; CVE-2022-47966 , an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability affecting several products due to the use of an outdated third-party dependency, Apache Santuario. "This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated adversary to execute arbitrary code," Zoho&nbsp; warned &nbsp;in an advisory issued late last year, noting that it affects all ManageEngine setups that have the SAML single sign-on (SSO) feature enabled, or had it enabled in the past. Horizon3.ai has now released Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) associated with the flaw, stating that it was able to successfully reproduce the exploit against ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus and ManageEngine Endpoint Central products.

A threat actor by the name&nbsp; Lolip0p &nbsp;has uploaded three rogue packages to the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that are designed to drop malware on compromised developer systems. The packages – named&nbsp; colorslib &nbsp;(versions 4.6.11 and 4.6.12),&nbsp; httpslib &nbsp;(versions 4.6.9 and 4.6.11), and&nbsp; libhttps &nbsp;(version 4.6.12) – by the author between January 7, 2023, and January 12, 2023.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A "large and resilient infrastructure" comprising over 250 domains is being used to distribute information-stealing malware such as&nbsp; Raccoon &nbsp;and&nbsp; Vidar &nbsp;since early 2020. The infection chain "uses about a hundred of fake cracked software catalogue websites that redirect to several links before downloading the payload hosted on file share platforms, such as GitHub," cybersecurity firm SEKOIA&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published earlier this month. The French cybersecurity company assessed the domains to be operated by a threat actor running a traffic direction system ( TDS ), which allows other cybercriminals to rent the service to distribute their malware. The attacks target users searching for cracked versions of software and games on search engines like Google, surfacing fraudulent websites on top by leveraging a technique called search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning to lure victims into downloading and executing the malicious payloads.

A new analysis of Raspberry Robin's attack infrastructure has&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that it's possible for other threat actors to repurpose the infections for their own malicious activities, making it an even more potent threat. Raspberry Robin (aka QNAP worm), attributed to a threat actor dubbed DEV-0856, is malware that has&nbsp; increasingly &nbsp; come under the radar &nbsp;for being used in attacks aimed at finance, government, insurance, and telecom entities. Given its use multiple threat actors to drop a wide range of payloads such as SocGholish , Bumblebee ,&nbsp; TrueBot ,&nbsp; IcedID , and&nbsp; LockBit &nbsp;ransomware, it's suspected to be a pay-per-install (PPI) botnet capable of serving next-stage payloads. Raspberry Robin, notably, employs infected USB drives as a propagation mechanism and leverages breached QNAP network-attached storage (NAS) devices as first-level command-and-control (C2).

In yet another campaign targeting the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository, six malicious packages have been found deploying information stealers on developer systems. The now-removed packages, which were&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;by Phylum between December 22 and December 31, 2022, include pyrologin, easytimestamp, discorder, discord-dev, style.py, and pythonstyles.

The malware is designed to launch a PowerShell script that retrieves a ZIP archive file, install invasive dependencies such as pynput, pydirectinput, and pyscreenshot, and run a Visual Basic Script extracted from the archive to execute more PowerShell code.

Dridex Malware Now Attacking macOS Systems with Novel Infection Method<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/dridex-malware-now-attacking-macos.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A variant of the infamous Dridex banking malware has set its sights on Apple's macOS operating system using a previously undocumented infection method, according to latest research. It has "adopted a new technique to deliver documents embedded with malicious macros to users without having to pretend to be invoices or other business-related files," Trend Micro researcher Armando Nathaniel Pedragoza&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. Dridex , also called Bugat and Cridex, is an information stealer that's known to harvest sensitive data from infected machines and deliver and execute malicious modules.

SpyNote Strikes Again: Android Spyware Targeting Financial Institutions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/spynote-strikes-again-android-spyware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Financial institutions are being targeted by a new version of Android malware called&nbsp; SpyNote &nbsp;at least since October 2022. "The reason behind this increase is that the developer of the spyware, who was previously selling it to other actors, made the source code public," ThreatFabric&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This has helped other actors [in] developing and distributing the spyware, often also targeting banking institutions." Some of the notable institutions that are impersonated by the malware include Deutsche Bank, HSBC U.K., Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Nubank. SpyNote (aka SpyMax) is feature-rich and comes with a plethora of capabilities that allow it to install arbitrary apps; gather SMS messages, calls, videos, and audio recordings; track GPS locations; and even hinder efforts to uninstall the app. It also follows the modus operandi of other&nbsp; banking &nbsp; malware &nbsp;by requesting for permissions to accessibility services to extract two-facto

The Evolving Tactics of Vidar Stealer: From Phishing Emails to Social Media<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/the-evolving-tactics-of-vidar-stealer.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious information-stealer known as&nbsp; Vidar &nbsp;is continuing to leverage popular social media services such as TikTok, Telegram, Steam, and Mastodon as an intermediate command-and-control (C2) server. "When a user creates an account on an online platform, a unique account page that can be accessed by anyone is generated," AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC) disclosed in a technical analysis&nbsp; published &nbsp;late last month. "Threat actors write identifying characters and the C2 address in parts of this page." In other words, the technique relies on actor-controlled throwaway accounts created on social media to retrieve the C2 address. An advantage to this approach is that should the C2 server be taken down or blocked, the adversary can trivially get around the restrictions by setting up a new server and editing the account pages to allow the previously distributed malware to communicate with the server. Vidar, first identified in 2018, is a&nbsp; commer

New shc-based Linux Malware Targeting Systems with Cryptocurrency Miner<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/new-shc-based-linux-malware-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Linux malware developed using the shell script compiler ( shc ) has been observed deploying a cryptocurrency miner on compromised systems. "It is presumed that after successful authentication through a dictionary attack on inadequately managed Linux SSH servers, various malware were installed on the target system," AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today. shc allows shell scripts to be converted directly into binaries, offering protections against unauthorized source code modifications. It's analogous to the&nbsp; BAT2EXE utility &nbsp;in Windows that's used to convert any batch file to an executable. In an attack chain detailed by the South Korean cybersecurity firm, a successful compromise of the SSH server leads to the deployment of an shc downloader malware along with a Perl-based DDoS IRC Bot. The shc downloader subsequently proceeds to fetch the XMRig miner software to mine cryptocurrency, with the IRC bot capable o

Raspberry Robin Worm Evolves to Attack Financial and Insurance Sectors in Europe<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/raspberry-robin-worm-evolves-to-attack.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Financial and insurance sectors in Europe have been targeted by the Raspberry Robin worm, as the malware continues to evolve its post-exploitation capabilities while remaining under the radar. "What is unique about the malware is that it is heavily obfuscated and highly complex to statically disassemble," Security Joes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published Monday. The intrusions, observed against Spanish and Portuguese-speaking organizations, are notable for collecting more victim machine data than previously documented, with the malware now exhibiting sophisticated techniques to resist analysis. Raspberry Robin, also called QNAP worm, is&nbsp; being used &nbsp;by several threat actors as a means to gain a foothold into target networks. Spread via infected USB drives and other methods, the framework has been recently put to use in attacks aimed at telecom and government sectors. Microsoft is tracking the operators of Raspberry Robin under the moniker&nbsp; DEV-0856 . Security Joes' f

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WordPress sites are being targeted by a previously unknown strain of Linux malware that exploits flaws in over two dozen plugins and themes to compromise vulnerable systems. "If sites use outdated versions of such add-ons, lacking crucial fixes, the targeted web pages are injected with malicious JavaScripts," Russian security vendor Doctor Web&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "As a result, when users click on any area of an attacked page, they are redirected to other sites." The attacks involve weaponizing a list of known security vulnerabilities in 19 different plugins and themes that are likely installed on a WordPress site, using it to deploy an implant that can target a specific website to further expand the network. It's also capable of injecting JavaScript code retrieved from a remote server in order to redirect the site visitors to an arbitrary website of the attacker's choice.

More than 300,000 users across 71 countries have been victimized by a new Android threat campaign called the&nbsp; Schoolyard Bully Trojan .  Mainly designed to steal Facebook credentials, the malware is camouflaged as legitimate education-themed applications to lure unsuspecting users into downloading them.  The apps, which were available for download from the official Google Play Store, have now been taken down. That said, they still continue to be available on third-party app stores.   "This trojan uses JavaScript injection to steal the Facebook credentials," Zimperium researchers Nipun Gupta and Aazim Bill SE Yaswant said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.  It achieves this by launching Facebook's login page in a WebView, which also embeds within it malicious JavasCript code to exfiltrate the user's phone number, email address, and password to a configured command-and-control (C2) server.

This is achieved by using the phone numbers associated with the infected devices as a means to gather the one-time password that's typically sent to verify the user when setting up new accounts.   "The malware asks the phone number of the user in the first screen," security researcher Maxime Ingrao, who discovered the malware,&nbsp; said , while also requesting for SMS permissions.  "Then it pretends to load the application but remains all the time on this page, it is to hide the interface of the received SMS and that the user does not see the SMS of subscriptions to the va

This Android File Manager App Infected Thousands of Devices with SharkBot Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/this-android-file-manager-app-infected.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Android banking fraud malware known as SharkBot  has reared its head once again on the official Google Play Store, posing as file managers to bypass the app marketplace's restrictions.  A majority of the users who downloaded the rogue apps are located in the U.K. and Italy, Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published this week.  SharkBot, first&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;towards the end of 2021 by Cleafy, is a&nbsp; recurring &nbsp; mobile &nbsp; threat &nbsp;distributed both on the Google Play Store and other third-party app stores.   One of the trojan's primary goals is to initiate money transfers from compromised devices via a technique called "Automatic Transfer System" ( ATS ), in which a transaction triggered via a banking app is intercepted to swap the payee account with an actor-controlled account in the background.  It's also capable of serving a fake login overlay when users attempt to open legitimate banking apps, stealing the credentials in the proce

"The operation ultimately hijacks Facebook Business accounts to which the victim has sufficient access. The threat actor uses their gained access to run ads for monetary gain."   Attributed to a Vietnamese threat actor, the Ducktail campaign is designed to target businesses in the digital marketing and advertising sectors which are active on the Facebook Ads and Business platform.  Also targeted are individuals within prospective companies that are likely to have high-level access to Facebook Business accounts. This includes

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A nascent and legitimate penetration testing framework known as Nighthawk is likely to gain threat actors' attention for its Cobalt Strike-like capabilities.  Enterprise security firm Proofpoint said it detected the use of the software in mid-September 2022 with a number of test emails sent using generic subject lines such as "Just checking in" and "Hope this works2."  However, there are no indications that a leaked or cracked version of Nighthawk is being weaponized by threat actors in the wild, Proofpoint researcher Alexander Rausch&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up.   Nighthawk, launched in December 2021 by a company called MDSec, is analogous to its counterparts&nbsp; Cobalt Strike ,&nbsp; Sliver , and&nbsp; Brute Ratel , offering a red team toolset for adversary threat simulation. It's licensed for £7,500 (or $10,000) per user for a year.  "Nighthawk is the most advanced and evasive command-and-control framework available on the market," MDSec&nbsp; notes . "Nighthawk i

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious extension for Chromium-based web browsers has been observed to be distributed via a long-standing Windows information stealer called ViperSoftX .  Czech-based cybersecurity company dubbed the rogue browser add-on VenomSoftX owing to its standalone features that enable it to access website visits, steal credentials and clipboard data, and even swap cryptocurrency addresses via an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attack.  ViperSoftX, which first&nbsp; came to light &nbsp;in February 2020, was characterized by&nbsp; Fortinet &nbsp;as a JavaScript-based remote access trojan and cryptocurrency stealer. The malware's use of a browser extension to advance its information-gathering goals was documented by Sophos threat analyst&nbsp; Colin Cowie &nbsp;earlier this year.   "This multi-stage stealer exhibits interesting hiding capabilities, concealed as small PowerShell scripts on a single line in the middle of otherwise innocent-looking large log files, among others," Avast researcher Jan Rubín&nbsp; said

The notorious Emotet malware has returned with renewed vigor as part of a high-volume malspam campaign designed to drop payloads like&nbsp; IcedID &nbsp;and&nbsp; Bumblebee .  "Hundreds of thousands of emails per day" have been sent since early November 2022, enterprise security company Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;last week, adding, "the new activity suggests Emotet is returning to its full functionality acting as a delivery network for major malware families."

Google Cloud last week disclosed that it identified 34 different hacked release versions of the Cobalt Strike tool in the wild, the earliest of which&nbsp; shipped &nbsp;in November 2012.  The versions, spanning 1.44 to 4.7, add up to a total of 275 unique JAR files, according to findings from the Google Cloud Threat Intelligence (GCTI) team.

The LodaRAT malware has resurfaced with new variants that are being deployed in conjunction with other sophisticated malware, such as RedLine Stealer and Neshta.

Malicious Google Play Store App Spotted Distributing Xenomorph Banking Trojan<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/these-two-google-play-store-apps.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has removed two new malicious dropper apps that have been detected on the Play Store for Android, one of which posed as a lifestyle app and was caught distributing the Xenomorph banking malware.  "Xenomorph is a trojan that steals credentials from banking applications on users' devices," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Himanshu Sharma and Viral Gandhi&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published Thursday.  "It is also capable of intercepting users' SMS messages and notifications, enabling it to steal one-time passwords and multi-factor authentication requests."   The cybersecurity firm said it also found an expense tracker app that exhibited similar behavior, but noted that it couldn't extract the URL used to fetch the malware artifact.   The two malicious apps are as follows -   Todo: Day manager (com.todo.daymanager)  経費キーパー (com.setprice.expenses)   Both the apps function as a dropper, meaning the apps themselves are harmless and are a conduit to retrieve t

Researchers Uncover PyPI Package Hiding Malicious Code Behind Image File<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/researchers-uncover-pypi-package-hiding.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious package discovered on the Python Package Index (PyPI) has been found employing a steganographic trick to conceal malicious code within image files.  The package in question, named " apicolor ," was uploaded to the Python third-party repository on October 31, 2022, and described as a "Core lib for REST API," according to Israeli cybersecurity firm&nbsp; Check Point . It has since been&nbsp; taken down .   Apicolor, like other&nbsp; rogue packages &nbsp;detected recently, harbors its malicious behavior in the setup script used to specify metadata associated with the package, such as its dependencies.  This takes the form of a second package called "judyb" as well as a seemingly harmless PNG file ("8F4D2uF.png") hosted on Imgur, an image-sharing service.   "The judyb code turned out to be a steganography module, responsible [for] hiding and revealing hidden messages inside pictures," Check Point explained.  The attack chain entails using the judy

New IceXLoader Malware Loader Variant Infected Thousands of Victims Worldwide<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/new-icexloader-malware-loader-variant.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An updated version of a malware loader codenamed&nbsp; IceXLoader &nbsp;is suspected of having compromised thousands of personal and enterprise Windows machines across the world.  IceXLoader is a commodity malware that's sold for $118 on underground forums for a lifetime license. It's chiefly employed to download and execute additional malware on breached hosts.  This past June, Fortinet FortiGuard Labs said it&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;a version of the trojan written in the Nim programming language with the goal of evading analysis and detection.   "While the version discovered in June (v3.0) looked like a work-in-progress, we recently observed a newer v3.3.3 loader which looks to be fully functionable and includes a multi-stage delivery chain," Natalie Zargarov, cybersecurity researcher at Minerva Labs,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday.  IceXLoader is traditionally distributed through phishing campaigns, with emails containing ZIP archives functioning as a trigger to deploy the malwar

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cryptocurrency users are being targeted with a new clipper malware strain dubbed&nbsp; Laplas &nbsp;by means of another malware known as SmokeLoader.  SmokeLoader, which is delivered by means of weaponized documents sent through spear-phishing emails, further acts as a conduit for other&nbsp; commodity trojans &nbsp;like&nbsp; SystemBC &nbsp;and&nbsp; Raccoon Stealer 2.0 , according to an&nbsp; analysis &nbsp;from Cyble.   Observed in the wild since circa 2013,&nbsp; SmokeLoader &nbsp;functions as a generic loader capable of distributing additional payloads onto compromised systems, such as information-stealing malware and other implants. In July 2022, it was found to deploy a backdoor called&nbsp; Amadey .  Cyble said it discovered over 180 samples of the Laplas since October 24, 2022, suggesting a wide deployment.   Clippers, also called ClipBankers, fall under a category of malware that Microsoft calls&nbsp; cryware , which are designed to steal crypto by keeping close tabs on a victim's clipboard activity and swapping the original wallet ad

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered 29 packages in Python Package Index (PyPI), the official third-party software repository for the Python programming language, that aim to infect developers' machines with a malware called W4SP Stealer .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Raccoon Stealer is back on the news again. US officials arrested Mark Sokolovsky, one of the malware actors behind this program. In July 2022, after several months of the shutdown, a Raccoon Stealer V2 went viral. Last week, the Department of Justice's press release stated that the malware collected 50 million credentials.  This article will give a quick guide to the latest info stealer's version.  What is Raccoon infostealer V2?  Raccoon Stealer &nbsp;is a kind of malware that steals various data from an infected computer. It's quite a basic malware, but hackers have made Raccoon popular with excellent service and simple navigation.&nbsp;  In 2019, Raccoon infostealer was one of the most discussed malware. In exchange for $75 per week and $200 per month, cybercriminals sold this simple but versatile info stealer as a MaaS. The malware was successful in attacking a number of systems. In March 2022, however, threat authors ceased to operate.&nbsp;  An updated version of this malware was r

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Android spyware campaign has been found striking Persian-speaking individuals by masquerading as a seemingly harmless VPN application.  Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky is tracking the campaign under the moniker&nbsp; SandStrike . It has not been attributed to any particular threat group.  "SandStrike is distributed as a means to access resources about the&nbsp; Bahá'í religion &nbsp;that are banned in Iran," the company noted in its&nbsp; APT trends report &nbsp;for the third quarter of 2022.   While the app is ostensibly designed to provide victims with a VPN connection to bypass the ban, it's also configured to covertly siphon data from the victims' devices, such as call logs, contacts, and even connect to a remote server to fetch additional commands.  The booby-trapped VPN service, while fully functional, is said to be distributed via a Telegram channel controlled by the adversary.  Links to the channel are also advertised on fabricated social media acco

Five malicious dropper Android apps with over 130,000 cumulative installations have been discovered on the Google Play Store distributing banking trojans like&nbsp; SharkBot &nbsp;and&nbsp; Vultur , which are capable of stealing financial data and performing on-device fraud.  "These droppers continue the unstopping evolution of malicious apps sneaking to the official store," Dutch mobile security firm ThreatFabric told The Hacker News in a statement.  "This evolution includes following newly introduced policies and masquerading as file managers and overcoming limitations by side-loading the malicious payload through the web browser."  Targets of these&nbsp; droppers &nbsp;include 231 banking and cryptocurrency wallet apps from financial institutions in Italy, the U.K., Germany, Spain, Poland, Austria, the U.S., Australia, France, and the Netherlands.

As many as 85 command-and-control (C2) servers have been&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;supported by the ShadowPad malware since September 2021, with infrastructure detected as recently as October 16, 2022.  That's according to VMware's Threat Analysis Unit (TAU), which&nbsp; studied &nbsp;three ShadowPad variants using TCP, UDP, and HTTP(S) protocols for C2 communications.  ShadowPad , seen as a successor to&nbsp; PlugX , is a modular malware platform privately shared among multiple Chinese state-sponsored actors since 2015.   Taiwanese cybersecurity firm TeamT5, earlier this May, disclosed details of another China-nexus modular implant named&nbsp; Pangolin8RAT , which is believed to be the successor of the PlugX and ShadowPad malware families, linking it to a threat group dubbed Tianwu.   An analysis of the three ShadowPad artifacts, which have been previously put to use by&nbsp; Winnti ,&nbsp; Tonto Team , and an emerging threat cluster codenamed&nbsp; Space Pirates , made it possible to discover the C2 servers by scanning th

The Ursnif malware has become the latest malware to shed its roots as a banking trojan to revamp itself into a generic backdoor capable of delivering next-stage payloads, joining the likes of Emotet, Qakbot, and TrickBot.  "This is a significant shift from the malware's original purpose to enable banking fraud, but is consistent with the broader threat landscape," Mandiant researchers Sandor Nemes, Sulian Lebegue, and Jessa Valdez&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a Wednesday analysis.   The refreshed and refactored variant, first spotted by the Google-owned threat intelligence firm in the wild on June 23, 2022, has been codenamed LDR4, in what's being seen as an attempt to lay the groundwork for potential ransomware and data theft extortion operations.  Ursnif, also called Gozi or ISFB, is one of the oldest banker malware families, with&nbsp; the earliest documented attacks &nbsp;going as far back as 2007.

The China-aligned espionage-focused actor dubbed Winnti has set its sights on government organizations in Hong Kong as part of an ongoing campaign dubbed&nbsp; Operation CuckooBees .  Active since at least 2007,&nbsp; Winnti &nbsp;(aka APT41, Barium, Bronze Atlas, and Wicked Panda) is the name designated to a prolific cyber threat group that carries out Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity, predominantly aimed at stealing intellectual property from organizations in developed economies.  The threat actor's campaigns have targeted healthcare, telecoms, high-tech, media, agriculture, and education sectors, with infection chains primarily relying on spear-phishing emails with attachments to initially break into the victims' networks.  Earlier this May, Cybereason&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;long-running attacks orchestrated by the group since 2019 to siphon technology secrets from technology and manufacturing companies mainly located in East Asia, Western Europe, and North America.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A PHP version of an information-stealing malware called&nbsp; Ducktail &nbsp;has been discovered in the wild being distributed in the form of cracked installers for legitimate apps and games, according to the latest findings from Zscaler.  "Like older versions (.NetCore), the latest version (PHP) also aims to exfiltrate sensitive information related to saved browser credentials, Facebook account information, etc.," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Tarun Dewan and Stuti Chaturvedi&nbsp; said .   Ducktail, which emerged on the threat landscape in late 2021, is attributed to an unnamed Vietnamese threat actor, with the malware primarily designed to hijack Facebook business and advertising accounts.  The financially motivated cybercriminal operation was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure (formerly F-Secure) in late July 2022.   While previous versions of the malware were found to use Telegram as a command-and-control (C2) channel to exfiltrate information, the PHP var

PoC Exploit Released for Critical Fortinet Auth Bypass Bug Under Active Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/poc-exploit-released-for-critical.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code has been made available for the recently disclosed critical security flaw affecting Fortinet FortiOS, FortiProxy, and FortiSwitchManager, making it imperative that users move quickly to apply the patches.  "FortiOS exposes a management web portal that allows a user to configure the system," Horizon3.ai researcher James Horseman&nbsp; said . "Additionally, a user can SSH into the system which exposes a locked down CLI interface."   The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-40684 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.6), concerns an&nbsp; authentication bypass &nbsp;vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to perform malicious operations on the administrative interface via specially crafted HTTP(S) requests.  A successful exploitation of the shortcoming is tantamount to granting complete access "to do just about anything" on the affected system, including altering network configurations, adding malicious users, and intercepting network traffic.   That said,

New Chinese Malware Attack Framework Targets Windows, macOS, and Linux Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/new-chinese-malware-attack-framework.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented command-and-control (C2) framework dubbed Alchimist is likely being used in the wild to target Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.  "Alchimist C2 has a web interface written in Simplified Chinese and can generate a configured payload, establish remote sessions, deploy payload to the remote machines, capture screenshots, perform remote shellcode execution, and run arbitrary commands," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Written in GoLang, Alchimist is complemented by a beacon implant called Insekt, which comes with remote access features that can be instrumented by the C2 server.   The discovery of Alchimist and its assorted family of malware implants comes three months after Talos also detailed another self-contained framework known as&nbsp; Manjusaka , which has been&nbsp; touted &nbsp;as the "Chinese sibling of Sliver and Cobalt Strike."  Even more interestingly, both Manjusaka and Alchimist pack in similar functionalities, desp

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unofficial version of the popular WhatsApp messaging app called YoWhatsApp has been observed deploying an Android trojan known as Triada.  The goal of the malware is to steal the keys that "allow the use of a WhatsApp account&nbsp; without the app ," Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "If the keys are stolen, a user of a malicious WhatsApp mod can lose control over their account."   YoWhatsApp offers the ability for users to lock chats, send messages to unsaved numbers, and customize the app with a variety of theming options. It's also said to share overlaps with other modded WhatsApp clients such as FMWhatsApp and HeyMods.  The Russian cybersecurity company said it found the malicious functionality in YoWhatsApp version 2.22.11.75.   Typically spread through fraudulent ads on Snaptube and Vidmate, the app, upon installation, requests the victims to grant it permissions to access SMS messages, enabling the malware to enroll them to paid subscriptions without their

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new piece of research has detailed the increasingly sophisticated nature of the malware toolset employed by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group named Earth Aughisky .  "Over the last decade, the group has continued to make adjustments in the tools and malware deployments on specific targets located in Taiwan and, more recently, Japan," Trend Micro&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a technical profile last week.  Earth Aughisky, also known as&nbsp; Taidoor , is a cyber espionage group that's known for its ability to abuse legitimate accounts, software, applications, and other weaknesses in the network design and infrastructure for its own ends.  While the Chinese threat actor has been known to primarily target organizations in Taiwan, victimology patterns observed towards late 2017 indicate an expansion to Japan.   The most commonly targeted industry verticals include government, telcom, manufacturing, heavy, technology, transportation, and healthcare.  Attack chains mounted by the group

Meta Platforms on Friday disclosed that it had identified over 400 malicious apps on Android and iOS that it said targeted online users with the goal of stealing their Facebook login information.  "These apps were listed on the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store and disguised as photo editors, games, VPN services, business apps, and other utilities to trick people into downloading them," the social media behemoth&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.   42.6% of the rogue apps were photo editors, followed by business utilities (15.4%), phone utilities (14.1%), games (11.7%), VPNs (11.7%), and lifestyle apps (4.4%). Interestingly, a majority of the iOS apps posed as ads manager tools for Meta and its Facebook subsidiary.  Besides concealing its malicious nature as a set of seemingly harmless apps, the operators of the scheme also published fake reviews that were designed to offset the negative reviews left by users who may have previously downloaded the apps

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Nicknamed ProxyNotShell, a new exploit used in the wild takes advantage of the recently published Microsoft Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability CVE-2022-41040 and a second vulnerability, CVE-2022-41082 that allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) when PowerShell is available to unidentified attackers.  Based on ProxyShell, this new zero-day abuse risk leverage a chained attack similar to the one used in the 2021 ProxyShell attack that exploited the combination of multiple vulnerabilities - CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-34473, and CVE-2021-31207 – to permit a remote actor to execute arbitrary code.  Despite the potential severity of attacks using them, ProxyShell vulnerabilities are still on CISA's list of top 2021 routinely exploited vulnerabilities.  Meet ProxyNotShell&nbsp;  Recorded on September 19, 2022, CVE-2022-41082 is an attack vector targeting Microsoft's Exchange Servers, enabling attacks of low complexity with low privileges required. Impacted services, if vulnerable, enable

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors have been found deploying never-before-seen post-compromise implants in VMware's virtualization software to seize control of infected systems and evade detection.  Google's Mandiant threat intelligence division referred to it as a "novel malware ecosystem" that impacts VMware ESXi, Linux vCenter servers, and Windows virtual machines, allowing attackers to maintain persistent access to the&nbsp; hypervisor &nbsp;as well as execute arbitrary commands.  The&nbsp; hyperjacking attacks , per the cybersecurity vendor, involved the use of malicious vSphere Installation Bundles ( VIBs ) to sneak in two implants, dubbed VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE, on the ESXi hypervisors.   "It is important to highlight that this is not an external remote code execution vulnerability; the attacker needs admin-level privileges to the ESXi hypervisor before they can deploy malware," Mandiant researchers Alexander Marvi, Jeremy Koppen, Tufail Ahmed, and Jonathan Lepore said in an exhaus

A new, multi-functional Go-based malware dubbed&nbsp; Chaos &nbsp;has been rapidly growing in volume in recent months to ensnare a wide range of Windows, Linux, small office/home office (SOHO) routers, and enterprise servers into its botnet.  "Chaos functionality includes the ability to enumerate the host environment, run remote shell commands, load additional modules, automatically propagate through stealing and brute-forcing SSH private keys, as well as launch DDoS attacks," researchers from Lumen's Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up shared with The Hacker News.  A majority of the bots are located in Europe, specifically Italy, with other infections reported in China and the U.S., collectively representing "hundreds of unique IP addresses" over a one-month time period from mid-June through mid-July 2022.   Written in Chinese and leveraging China-based infrastructure for command-and-control, the botnet joins a long list of malware that are designed to establish persi

Cybercriminals are continuing to prey on users searching for cracked software by directing them to fraudulent websites hosting weaponized installers that deploy malware called&nbsp; NullMixer&nbsp; on compromised systems.  "When a user extracts and executes NullMixer, it drops a number of malware files to the compromised machine," cybersecurity firm Kaspersky said in a Monday report. "It drops a wide variety of malicious binaries to infect the machine with, such as backdoors, bankers, downloaders, spyware, and many others."  Besides siphoning users' credentials, address, credit card data, cryptocurrencies, and even Facebook and Amazon account session cookies, what makes NullMixer insidious is its ability to download dozens of trojans at once, significantly widening the scale of the infections.   Attack chains typically start when a user attempts to download cracked software from one of the sites, which leads to a password-protected archive that contains an executable fil

As many as 75 apps on Google Play and 10 on Apple App Store have been discovered engaging in ad fraud as part of an ongoing campaign that commenced in 2019.  The latest iteration, dubbed&nbsp; Scylla &nbsp;by Online fraud-prevention firm HUMAN Security, follows similar attack waves in August 2019 and late 2020 that go by the codename Poseidon and Charybdis, respectively.  Prior to their removal from the app storefronts, the apps had been collectively installed more than 13 million times.   The original Poseidon operation comprised over 40 Android apps that were designed to display ads out of context or hidden from the view of the device user.  Charybdis, on the other hand, was an improvement over the former by making use of code obfuscation tactics to target advertising platforms.   Scylla presents the latest adaption of the scheme in that it expands beyond Android to make a foray into the iOS ecosystem for the first time, alongside relying on additional layers of code roundabout using the&nbsp; All

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have exposed new connections between a widely used pay-per-install (PPI) malware service known as PrivateLoader and another PPI platform offered by a cybercriminal actor dubbed ruzki.  "The threat actor ruzki (aka les0k, zhigalsz) advertises their PPI service on underground Russian-speaking forums and their Telegram channels under the name ruzki or zhigalsz since at least May 2021," SEKOIA  said.  The cybersecurity firm said its investigations into the twin services led it to conclude that PrivateLoader is the proprietary loader of the ruzki PPI malware service.  PrivateLoader, as the name implies, functions as a C++-based loader to download and deploy additional malicious payloads on infected Windows hosts. It's primarily distributed through SEO-optimized websites that claim to provide cracked software.  Although it was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;earlier this February by Intel471, it's said to have been put to use starting as early as May 2021.   S

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Gamers looking for cheats on YouTube are being targeted with links to malicious password-protected archive files designed to install the RedLine Stealer malware and crypto miners on compromised machines.  "The videos advertise cheats and cracks and provide instructions on hacking popular games and software," Kaspersky security researcher Oleg Kupreev&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today.   Games mentioned in the videos are APB Reloaded, CrossFire, DayZ, Farming Simulator, Farthest Frontier, FIFA 22, Final Fantasy XIV, Forza, Lego Star Wars, Sniper Elite, and Spider-Man, among others.   Downloading the self-extracting RAR archive leads to the execution of Redline Stealer, a coin miner, as well as a number of other binaries that enable the bundle's self-propagation.  Specifically, this is achieved by means of an open-source C#-based password stealer that's capable of extracting cookies from browsers, which is then used by the operators to gain unauthorized access to

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 has detailed the inner workings of a malware called&nbsp; OriginLogger , which has been touted as a successor to the widely used information stealer and remote access trojan (RAT) known as&nbsp; Agent Tesla .  A .NET based keylogger and remote access, Agent Tesla has had a long-standing presence in the threat landscape, allowing malicious actors to gain remote access to targeted systems and beacon sensitive information to an actor-controlled domain.  Known to be used in the wild since 2014, it's advertised for sale on dark web forums and is generally distributed through malicious spam emails as an attachment.  In February 2021, cybersecurity firm Sophos&nbsp; disclosed two new variants &nbsp;of the commodity malware (version 2 and 3) that featured capabilities to steal credentials from web browsers, email apps, and VPN clients, as well as use Telegram API for command-and-control.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new piece of stealthy Linux malware called Shikitega has been uncovered adopting a multi-stage infection chain to compromise endpoints and IoT devices and deposit additional payloads.  "An attacker can gain full control of the system, in addition to the cryptocurrency miner that will be executed and set to persist," AT&amp;T Alien Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published Tuesday.  The findings add to a growing list of Linux malware that has been found in the wild in recent months, including&nbsp; BPFDoor ,&nbsp; Symbiote ,&nbsp; Syslogk ,&nbsp; OrBit , and&nbsp; Lightning Framework .   Once deployed on a targeted host, the attack chain downloads and executes the Metasploit's " Mettle " meterpreter to maximize control, exploits vulnerabilities to elevate its privileges, adds persistence on the host via crontab, and ultimately launches a cryptocurrency miner on infected devices.  The exact method by which the initial compromise is achieved remains unknown as yet, but what makes Shikitega

Researchers discovered a private Telegram channel-based backdoor in the information stealing malware, dubbed Prynt Stealer , which its developer added with the intention of secretly stealing a copy of victims' exfiltrated data when used by other cybercriminals.  "While this untrustworthy behavior is nothing new in the world of cybercrime, the victims' data end up in the hands of multiple threat actors, increasing the risks of one or more large scale attacks to follow," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Atinderpal Singh and Brett Stone-Gross&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.  Prynt Stealer, which&nbsp; came to light &nbsp;earlier this April, comes with capabilities to log keystrokes, steal credentials from web browsers, and siphon data from Discord and Telegram. It's sold for $100 for a one-month license and $900 for a lifetime subscription.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have identified functional similarities between a malicious component used in the Raspberry Robin infection chain and a Dridex malware loader, further strengthening the operators' connections to the Russia-based Evil Corp group.  The findings suggest that "Evil Corp is likely using Raspberry Robin infrastructure to carry out its attacks," IBM Security X-Force researcher Kevin Henson&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday analysis.  Raspberry Robin (aka QNAP Worm), first&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;by cybersecurity company Red Canary in September 2021, has remained something of a mystery for nearly a year, partly owing to the noticeable lack of post-exploitation activities in the wild.   That changed in July 2022 when Microsoft&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that it observed the&nbsp; FakeUpdates &nbsp;(aka SocGholish) malware being delivered via existing Raspberry Robin infections, with potential connections identified between DEV-0206 and DEV-0243 (aka Evil Corp).

Hackers Hide Malware in Stunning Images Taken by James Webb Space Telescope<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/hackers-hide-malware-in-stunning-images.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A persistent Golang-based malware campaign dubbed GO#WEBBFUSCATOR has leveraged the deep field image taken from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as a lure to deploy malicious payloads on infected systems.  The development, revealed by Securonix , points to the growing adoption of Go among threat actors, given the programming language's cross-platform support, effectively allowing the operators to leverage a common codebase to target different operating systems.  Go binaries also have the added benefit of&nbsp;rendering reverse engineering a lot more challenging as opposed to malware written in other languages like C++ or C#, not to mention prolong analysis and detection attempts.  Phishing emails containing a Microsoft Office attachment act as the entry point for the attack chain that, when opened, retrieves an obfuscated VBA macro, which, in turn, is auto-executed should the recipient enable macros.   The execution of the macro results in the download of an image file &amp;quo

The threat actor behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack has been linked to yet another "highly targeted" post-exploitation malware that could be used to maintain persistent access to compromised environments.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WordPress sites are being hacked to display fraudulent Cloudflare DDoS protection pages that lead to the delivery of malware such as NetSupport RAT and Raccoon Stealer.  "A recent surge in JavaScript injections targeting WordPress sites has resulted in fake DDoS prevent prompts which lead victims to download remote access trojan malware," Sucuri's Ben Martin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published last week.  Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection pages are essential browser verification checks designed to deter bot-driven unwanted and malicious traffic from eating up bandwidth and taking down websites.  The new attack vector involves hijacking WordPress sites to display fake DDoS protection pop-ups that, when clicked, ultimately lead to the download of a malicious ISO file ("security_install.iso") to the victim's systems.   This is achieved by injecting three lines of code into a JavaScript file ("jquery.min.js"), or alternatively into the active

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators of the XCSSET macOS malware have upped the stakes by making iterative improvements that add support for macOS Monterey by upgrading its source code components to Python 3.  "The malware authors have changed from hiding the primary executable in a fake Xcode.app in the initial versions in 2020 to a fake Mail.app in 2021 and now to a fake Notes.app in 2022," SentinelOne researchers Phil Stokes and Dinesh Devadoss&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.  XCSSET, first&nbsp; documented &nbsp;by Trend Micro in 2020, has many moving parts that allow it to&nbsp; harvest sensitive information &nbsp;from Apple Notes, WeChat, Skype, and Telegram; inject malicious JavaScript code into various websites; and dump cookies from Safari web browser.   Infection chains entail using a dropper to compromise users' Xcode projects with the backdoor, with the latter also taking steps to evade detection by masquerading as either system software or the Google Chrome web browser application.

Atlanta-based cyber risk intelligence company, Cyble discovered a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) malware. What makes this particular RAT malware distinct enough to be named after the&nbsp; comic creation of Sacha Baron Cohen ?  RAT malware typically helps cybercriminals gain complete control of a victim's system, permitting them to access network resources, files, and power to toggle the mouse and keyboard. Borat RAT malware goes beyond the standard features and enables threat actors to deploy ransomware and&nbsp; DDoS attacks . It also increases the number of threat actors who can launch attacks, sometimes appealing to the lowest common denominator. The added functionality of carrying out DDoS attacks makes it insidious and a risk to today's digital organizations.  Ransomware has been the most common top attack type for over&nbsp; three years . According to an IBM report, REvil was the most common ransomware strain, consisting of about&nbsp; 37% &nbsp;of all ransomware attacks. Borat RAT is a unique

A .NET-based evasive crypter named&nbsp; DarkTortilla&nbsp; has been used by threat actors to distribute a broad array of commodity malware as well as targeted payloads like Cobalt Strike and Metasploit, likely&nbsp; since 2015 .  "It can also deliver 'add-on packages' such as additional malicious payloads, benign decoy documents, and executables," cybersecurity firm Secureworks&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report. "It features robust anti-analysis and anti-tamper controls that can make detection, analysis, and eradication challenging."  Malware delivered by the crypter includes information steakers and remote access trojans (RATs) such as Agent Tesla, AsyncRat, NanoCore, and RedLine Stealer. "DarkTortilla has versatility that similar malware does not," the researchers noted.   Crypters are&nbsp; software tools &nbsp;that use a&nbsp; combination &nbsp;of encryption, obfuscation, and code manipulation of malware so as to&nbsp; bypass detection &nbsp;by security solutions.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More than 1.31 million users attempted to install malicious or unwanted web browser extensions at least once, new findings from cybersecurity firm Kaspersky show.  "From January 2020 to June 2022, more than 4.3 million unique users were attacked by adware hiding in browser extensions, which is approximately 70% of all users affected by malicious and unwanted add-ons," the company&nbsp; said .  As many as 1,311,557 users fall under this category in the first half of 2022, per Kaspersky's telemetry data. In comparison, the number of such users peaked in 2020 at 3,660,236, followed by 1,823,263 unique users in 2021.  The most prevalent threat is a family of adware called WebSearch, which masquerade as PDF viewers and other utilities, and comes with capabilities to collect and analyze search queries and redirect users to affiliate links.   WebSearch is also notable for modifying the browser's start page, which contains a search engine and a number of links to third-party sour

SOVA Android Banking Trojan Returns With New Capabilities and Targets<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/sova-android-banking-trojan-returns-new.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The SOVA Android banking trojan is continuing to be actively developed with upgraded capabilities to target no less than 200 mobile applications, including banking apps and crypto exchanges and wallets, up from 90 apps when it started out.  That's according to the latest findings from Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy, which found newer versions of the malware sporting functionality to intercept two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, steal cookies, and expand its targeting to cover Australia, Brazil, China, India, the Philippines, and the U.K.  SOVA, meaning Owl in Russian, came to light in&nbsp; September 2021 &nbsp;when it was observed striking financial and shopping apps from the U.S. and Spain for harvesting credentials through overlay attacks by taking advantage of Android's Accessibility services.   In less than a year, the trojan has also acted as a foundation for another Android malware called&nbsp; MaliBot &nbsp;that's designed to target online banking and cryptocurrency wallet custo

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-removed rogue package pushed to the official third-party software repository for Python has been found to deploy cryptominers on Linux systems.  The module, named " secretslib " and&nbsp; downloaded 93 times &nbsp;prior to its deletion, was released to the Python Package Index (PyPI) on August 6, 2022 and is described as "secrets matching and verification made easy."   "On a closer inspection though, the package covertly runs cryptominers on your Linux machine in-memory (directly from your RAM), a technique largely employed by fileless malware and crypters," Sonatype researcher Ax Sharma&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a report last week.  It achieves this by executing a Linux executable file retrieved from a remote server post installation, whose main task is to drop an&nbsp; ELF &nbsp;file (" memfd ") directly in memory that functions as a Monero cryptominer, after which it gets deleted by the "secretslib" package.

Threat actors are increasingly mimicking legitimate applications like Skype, Adobe Reader, and VLC Player as a means to abuse trust relationships and increase the likelihood of a successful social engineering attack.  Other most impersonated legitimate apps by icon include 7-Zip, TeamViewer, CCleaner, Microsoft Edge, Steam, Zoom, and WhatsApp, an analysis from VirusTotal has revealed.  "One of the simplest social engineering tricks we've seen involves making a malware sample seem a legitimate program," VirusTotal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. "The icon of these programs is a critical feature used to convince victims that these programs are legitimate."  It's no surprise that threat actors resort to a variety of approaches to compromise endpoints by tricking unwitting users into downloading and running seemingly innocuous executables.   This, in turn, is primarily achieved by taking advantage of genuine domains in a bid to get around IP-based firewall defenses

The operators of the Gootkit access-as-a-service ( AaaS ) malware have resurfaced with updated techniques to compromise unsuspecting victims.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious campaign leveraged seemingly innocuous Android dropper apps on the Google Play Store to compromise users' devices with&nbsp; banking &nbsp; malware .  These 17 dropper apps, collectively dubbed&nbsp; DawDropper &nbsp;by Trend Micro, masqueraded as productivity and utility apps such as document scanners, QR code readers, VPN services, and call recorders, among others. All these apps in question have been removed from the app marketplace.   "DawDropper uses Firebase Realtime Database, a third-party cloud service, to evade detection and dynamically obtain a payload download address," the researchers&nbsp; said . "It also hosts malicious payloads on GitHub."   Droppers are apps designed to sneak past Google's Play Store security checks, following which they are used to download more potent and intrusive malware on a device, in this case,&nbsp; Octo &nbsp;(Coper),&nbsp; Hydra ,&nbsp; Ermac , and&nbsp; TeaBot .

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as 30 malicious Android apps with cumulative downloads of nearly 10 million have been found on the Google Play Store distributing adware.  "All of them were built into various programs, including image-editing software, virtual keyboards, system tools and utilities, calling apps, wallpaper collection apps, and others," Dr.Web&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday write-up.  While masquerading as innocuous apps, their primary goal is to request permissions to show windows over other apps and run in the background in order to serve intrusive ads.  To make it difficult for the victims to detect and uninstall the apps, the adware trojans hide their icons from the list of installed apps in the home screen or replace the icons with others that are likely to be less noticed (e.g., SIM Toolkit).   Some of these apps also offer the advertised features, as observed in the case of two apps: "Water Reminder- Tracker &amp; Reminder" and "Yoga- For Beginner to Advanced." However

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Facebook business and advertising accounts are at the receiving end of an ongoing campaign dubbed&nbsp; Ducktail &nbsp;designed to seize control as part of a financially driven cybercriminal operation.&nbsp;  "The threat actor targets individuals and employees that may have access to a Facebook Business account with an information-stealer malware," Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure (formerly F-Secure Business)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.  "The malware is designed to steal browser cookies and take advantage of authenticated Facebook sessions to steal information from the victim's Facebook account and ultimately hijack any Facebook Business account that the victim has sufficient access to."  The attacks, attributed to a Vietnamese threat actor, are said to have begun in the latter half of 2021, with primary targets being individuals with managerial, digital marketing, digital media, and human resources roles in companies.

Malicious IIS Extensions Gaining Popularity Among Cyber Criminals for Persistent Access<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/malicious-iis-extensions-gaining.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are increasingly abusing Internet Information Services ( IIS ) extensions to backdoor servers as a means of establishing a "durable persistence mechanism."  That's according to a&nbsp; new warning &nbsp;from the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team, which said that "IIS backdoors are also harder to detect since they mostly reside in the same directories as legitimate modules used by target applications, and they follow the same code structure as clean modules."  Attack chains taking this approach commence with weaponizing a critical vulnerability in the hosted application for initial access, using this foothold to drop a script web shell as the first stage payload.   This web shell then becomes the conduit for installing a rogue IIS module to provide highly covert and persistent access to the server, in addition to monitoring incoming and outgoing requests as well as running remote commands.  Indeed, earlier this month, Kaspersky researchers disclosed a cam

SmokeLoader Infecting Targeted Systems with Amadey Info-Stealing Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/smokeloader-infecting-targeted-systems.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An information-stealing malware called Amadey is being distributed by means of another backdoor called SmokeLoader.  The attacks hinge on tricking users into downloading SmokeLoader that masquerades as software cracks, paving the way for the deployment of Amadey, researchers from the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.   Amadey , a botnet that&nbsp; first appeared &nbsp;around October 2018 on Russian underground forums for $600, is equipped to siphon crendentials, capture screenshots, system metadata, and even information about antivirus engines and additional malware installed on an infected machine.   While an update was spotted last July by Walmart Global Tech&nbsp; incorporated &nbsp;functionality for harvesting data from Mikrotik routers and Microsoft Outlook, the toolset has since been upgraded to capture information from FileZilla, Pidgin, Total Commander FTP Client, RealVNC, TightVNC, TigerVNC, and WinSCP.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown Chinese-speaking threat actor has been attributed to a new kind of sophisticated UEFI firmware rootkit called&nbsp; CosmicStrand .  "The rootkit is located in the firmware images of Gigabyte or ASUS motherboards, and we noticed that all these images are related to designs using the H81 chipset," Kaspersky researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today. "This suggests that a common vulnerability may exist that allowed the attackers to inject their rootkit into the firmware's image."  Victims identified are said to be private individuals located in China, Vietnam, Iran, and Russia, with no discernible ties to any organization or industry vertical. The attribution to a Chinese-speaking threat actor stems from code overlaps between CosmicStrand and other malware such as the MyKings botnet and MoonBounce.

The Racoon Stealer malware as a service platform gained notoriety several years ago for its ability to extract data that is stored within a Web browser.

Racoon Stealer was also designed to steal auto-fill data, which can include a vast trove of personal information ranging from basic contact data to credit card numbers. As if all of that were not enough, Racoon Stealer also had the ability to steal cryptocurrency and to steal (or drop) files on an infected system.  As bad as Racoon Stealer might have been, its developers have recently created a new version that is designed to be far more damaging than the version that previously existed.&nbsp;   New Racoon Stealer Capabilities  The new version of Raccoon Stealer &nbsp;still has the ability to steal browser passwords, cookies, and auto-fill data.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A never-before-seen Linux malware has been dubbed a "Swiss Army Knife" for its modular architecture and its capability to install rootkits.  This previously undetected Linux threat, called&nbsp; Lightning Framework &nbsp;by Intezer, is equipped with a plethora of features, making it one of the most intricate frameworks developed for targeting Linux systems.  "The framework has both passive and active capabilities for communication with the threat actor, including opening up SSH on an infected machine, and a polymorphic malleable command and control configuration," Intezer researcher Ryan Robinson&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today.   Central to the malware is a downloader ("kbioset") and a core ("kkdmflush") module, the former of which is engineered to retrieve at least seven different plugins from a remote server that are subsequently invoked by the core component.  In addition, the downloader is also responsible for establishing the persistence of t

Experts Uncover New CloudMensis Spyware Targeting Apple macOS Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/experts-uncover-new-cloudmensis-spyware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a previously undocumented spyware targeting the Apple macOS operating system.  The malware, codenamed&nbsp; CloudMensis &nbsp;by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, is said to exclusively use public cloud storage services such as pCloud, Yandex Disk, and Dropbox for receiving attacker commands and exfiltrating files.  "Its capabilities clearly show that the intent of its operators is to gather information from the victims' Macs by exfiltrating documents, keystrokes, and screen captures," ESET researcher Marc-Etienne M.Léveillé&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today.   CloudMensis, written in Objective-C, was first discovered in April 2022 and is designed to strike both Intel and Apple silicon architectures. The initial infection vector for the attacks and the targets remain unknown as yet. But its very limited distribution is an indication that the malware is being used as part of a highly targeted operation directed against entities of i

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has taken steps to ax dozens of fraudulent apps from the official Play Store that were spotted propagating Joker, Facestealer, and Coper malware families through the virtual marketplace.  While the Android storefront is considered to be a trusted source for discovering and installing apps, bad actors have repeatedly found ways to sneak past security barriers erected by Google in hopes of luring unsuspecting users into downloading malware-laced apps.  The latest findings from&nbsp; Zscaler ThreatLabz &nbsp;and&nbsp; Pradeo &nbsp;are no different. "Joker is one of the most&nbsp; prominent malware families &nbsp;targeting Android devices," researchers Viral Gandhi and Himanshu Sharma said in a Monday report.  "Despite public awareness of this particular malware, it keeps finding its way into Google's official app store by regularly modifying the malware's trace signatures including updates to the code, execution methods, and payload-retrieving techniques."

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered new variants of the&nbsp; ChromeLoader &nbsp;information-stealing malware, highlighting its evolving feature set in a short span of time.  Primarily used for hijacking victims' browser searches and presenting advertisements, ChromeLoader came to light in January 2022 and has been distributed in the form of ISO or DMG file downloads advertised via QR codes on Twitter and free gaming sites.  ChromeLoader has also been codenamed Choziosi Loader and ChromeBack by the broader cybersecurity community. What makes the adware notable is that it's fashioned as a browser extension as opposed to a Windows executable (.exe) or Dynamic Link Library (.dll).   The infections typically work by enticing unsuspecting users into downloading movie torrents or cracked video games through malvertising campaigns on pay-per-install sites and social media.  Besides requesting invasive permissions to access browser data and manipulate web requests, it's also designed t

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind the Qakbot malware are transforming their delivery vectors in an attempt to sidestep detection.  "Most recently, threat actors have transformed their techniques to evade detection by using ZIP file extensions, enticing file names with common formats, and Excel (XLM) 4.0 to trick victims into downloading malicious attachments that install Qakbot," Zscaler Threatlabz researchers Tarun Dewan and Aditya Sharma&nbsp; said .   Other methods adopted by the group include code obfuscation, introducing new layers in the attack chain from initial compromise to execution, and using multiple URLs as well as unknown file extensions (e.g., .OCX, .ooccxx, .dat, or .gyp) to deliver the payload.  Also called QBot, QuackBot, or Pinkslipbot, Qakbot has been a&nbsp; recurring threat &nbsp;since late 2007, evolving from its initial days as a banking trojan to a modular information stealer capable of deploying next-stage payloads such as&nbsp; ransomware .

It was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by researchers from Red Canary in May 2022.   Also codenamed&nbsp; QNAP worm &nbsp;by Sekoia, the malware leverages a legitimate Windows installer binary called "msiexec.exe" to download and execute a malicious shared library (DLL) from a compromised QNAP NAS appliance.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious browser extension with 350 variants is masquerading as a Google Translate add-on as part of an adware campaign targeting Russian users of Google Chrome, Opera, and Mozilla Firefox browsers.  Mobile security firm Zimperium dubbed the malware family&nbsp; ABCsoup , stating the "extensions are installed onto a victim's machine via a Windows-based executable, bypassing most endpoint security solutions, along with the security controls found in the official extension stores."  The rogue browser add-ons come with the same extension ID as that of Google Translate — " aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb " — in an attempt to trick users into believing that they have installed a legitimate extension.   The extensions are not available on the official browser web stores themselves. Rather they are delivered through different Windows executables that install the add-on on the victim's web browser.

Researchers have disclosed a new large-scale cryptocurrency mining campaign targeting the NPM JavaScript package repository.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a new and entirely undetected Linux threat dubbed&nbsp; OrBit , signally a growing trend of malware attacks geared towards the popular operating system.  The malware gets its name from one of the filenames that's utilized to temporarily store the output of executed commands ("/tmp/.orbit"), according to cybersecurity firm Intezer.  "It can be installed either with persistence capabilities or as a volatile implant," security researcher Nicole Fishbein&nbsp; said . "The malware implements advanced evasion techniques and gains persistence on the machine by hooking key functions, provides the threat actors with remote access capabilities over SSH, harvests credentials, and logs TTY commands."  OrBit is the fourth Linux malware to have come to light in a short span of three months after&nbsp; BPFDoor ,&nbsp; Symbiote , and&nbsp; Syslogk .

Researchers Uncover Malicious NPM Packages Stealing Data from Apps and Web Forms<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/researchers-uncover-malicious-npm.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A widespread software supply chain attack has targeted the NPM package manager at least since December 2021 with rogue modules designed to steal data entered in forms by users on websites that include them.  The coordinated attack, dubbed IconBurst by ReversingLabs, involves no fewer than two dozen NPM packages that include obfuscated JavaScript, which comes with malicious code to harvest sensitive data from forms embedded downstream mobile applications and websites.  "These clearly malicious attacks relied on typo-squatting, a technique in which attackers offer up packages via public repositories with names that are similar to — or common misspellings of — legitimate packages," security researcher Karlo Zanki&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. "Attackers impersonated high-traffic NPM modules like umbrellajs and packages published by ionic.io."   The packages in question, most of which were published in the last months, have been collectively downloaded more than 27,000 t

Gardeners know that worms are good. Cybersecurity professionals know that worms are&nbsp; bad . Very bad. In fact, worms are literally the most devasting force for evil known to the computing world. The&nbsp; MyDoom &nbsp;worm holds the dubious position of most costly computer malware&nbsp; ever &nbsp;– responsible for some&nbsp; $52 billion &nbsp;in damage. In second place…&nbsp; Sobig , another worm.  It turns out, however, that there are exceptions to every rule. Some biological worms are actually&nbsp; not welcome &nbsp;in most gardens. And some cyber worms, it seems, can use their powers for good …&nbsp;  Meet Hopper, The Good Worm  Detection tools are not good at&nbsp; catching non-exploit-based propagation , which is what worms do best. Most cybersecurity solutions are less resilient to worm attack methods like token impersonation and others that take advantage of deficient internal configurations - PAM, segmentation, insecure credential storage, and more.  So, what better way to beat a stealthy worm than with … another stealthy worm?

Microsoft Warns About Evolving Capabilities of Toll Fraud Android Malware Apps<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/microsoft-warns-about-evolving.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has detailed the evolving capabilities of toll fraud malware apps on Android, pointing out its "complex multi-step attack flow" and an improved mechanism to evade security analysis.  Toll fraud belongs to a category of billing fraud wherein malicious mobile applications come with hidden subscription fees, roping in unsuspecting users to premium content without their knowledge or consent.  It's also different from other&nbsp; fleeceware threats &nbsp;in that the malicious functions are only carried out when a compromised device is connected to one of its target network operators.  "It also, by default, uses cellular connection for its activities and forces devices to connect to the mobile network even if a Wi-Fi connection is available," Dimitrios Valsamaras and Sang Shin Jung of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an exhaustive analysis.

A newly discovered malware has been put to use in the wild at least since March 2021 to backdoor Microsoft Exchange servers belonging to a wide range of entities worldwide, with infections lingering in 20 organizations as of June 2022.  Dubbed&nbsp; SessionManager , the malicious tool masquerades as a module for Internet Information Services ( IIS ), a web server software for Windows systems, after exploiting one of the ProxyLogon flaws within Exchange servers.&nbsp;  Targets included 24 distinct NGOs, government, military, and industrial organizations spanning Africa, South America, Asia, Europe, Russia and the Middle East. A total of 34 servers have been compromised by a SessionManager variant to date.   This is far from the first time the technique has been&nbsp; observed in real-world attacks .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have documented a new information-stealing malware that targets YouTube content creators by plundering their authentication cookies.  Dubbed "YTStealer" by Intezer, the malicious tool is likely believed to be sold as a service on the dark web, with it distributed using fake installers that also drop RedLine Stealer and Vidar.  "What sets YTStealer aside from other stealers sold on the dark web market is that it is solely focused on harvesting credentials for one single service instead of grabbing everything it can get ahold of," security researcher Joakim Kenndy said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.  The malware's modus operandi, however, mirrors its counterparts in that it extracts the cookie information from the web browser's database files in the user's profile folder. The reasoning given behind targeting content creators is that it uses one of the installed browsers on the infected machine to gather YouTube channel

A never-before-seen remote access trojan dubbed ZuoRAT  has been singling out small office/home office (SOHO) routers as part of a sophisticated campaign targeting North American and European networks.  The malware "grants the actor the ability to pivot into the local network and gain access to additional systems on the LAN by hijacking network communications to maintain an undetected foothold," researchers from Lumen Black Lotus Labs said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The stealthy operation, which targeted routers from ASUS, Cisco, DrayTek, and NETGEAR, is believed to have commenced in early 2020 during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, effectively remaining under the radar for over two years.  "Consumers and remote employees routinely use SOHO routers, but these devices are rarely monitored or patched, which makes them one of the weakest points of a network's perimeter," the company's threat intelligence team said.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malware-as-a-service (Maas) dubbed&nbsp; Matanbuchus &nbsp;has been observed spreading through phishing campaigns, ultimately dropping the Cobalt Strike post-exploitation framework on compromised machines.  Matanbuchus, like other&nbsp; malware loaders &nbsp;such as&nbsp; BazarLoader ,&nbsp; Bumblebee , and&nbsp; Colibri , is engineered to download and execute second-stage executables from command-and-control (C&amp;C) servers on infected systems without detection.  Available on Russian-speaking cybercrime forums for a price of $2,500 since February 2021, the malware is equipped with capabilities to launch .EXE and .DLL files in memory and run arbitrary PowerShell commands.   The findings, released by threat intelligence firm Cyble last week, document the latest infection chain associated with the loader, which is linked to a threat actor who goes by the online moniker BelialDemon.  "If we look historically, BelialDemon has been involved in the development of malware loaders," Unit 42 researchers Jeff White

Researchers have discovered a number of malicious Python packages in the official third-party software repository that are engineered to exfiltrate AWS credentials and environment variables to a publicly exposed endpoint.  The list of packages includes loglib-modules, pyg-modules, pygrata, pygrata-utils, and hkg-sol-utils, according to Sonatype security researcher Ax Sharma. The packages and as well as the endpoint have now been taken down.  "Some of these packages either contain code that reads and exfiltrates your secrets or use one of the dependencies that will do the job," Sharma&nbsp; said .   The malicious code injected into "loglib-modules" and "pygrata-utils" allow it to harvest AWS credentials, network interface information, and environment variables and export them to a remote endpoint: "hxxp://graph.pygrata[.]com:8000/upload."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind the Rig Exploit Kit have swapped the Raccoon Stealer malware for the Dridex financial trojan as part of an ongoing campaign that commenced in January 2022.  The switch in modus operandi,&nbsp; spotted &nbsp;by Romanian company Bitdefender, comes in the wake of Raccoon Stealer&nbsp; temporarily closing the project &nbsp;after one of its team members responsible for critical operations passed away in the Russo-Ukrainian war in March 2022.  The Rig Exploit Kit is notable for its abuse of browser exploits to distribute an array of malware. First spotted in 2019, Raccoon Stealer is a credential-stealing trojan that's advertised and sold on underground forums as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) for $200 a month.   That said, the Raccoon Stealer actors are already working on a second version that's expected to be "rewritten from scratch and optimized." But the void left by the malware's exit is being filled by other information stealers such as RedLine Stealer and Vidar.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind&nbsp; BRATA &nbsp;have once again added more capabilities to the Android mobile malware in an attempt to make their attacks against financial apps more stealthy.  "In fact, the modus operandi now fits into an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) activity pattern," Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report last week. "This term is used to describe an attack campaign in which criminals establish a long-term presence on a targeted network to steal sensitive information."   An acronym for "Brazilian Remote Access Tool Android," BRATA was first&nbsp; detected &nbsp;in the wild in Brazil in late 2018, before making its first appearance in Europe last April, while masquerading as antivirus software and other common productivity tools to trick users into downloading them.  The change in the attack pattern, which scaled new highs in early April 2022, involves tailoring the malware to strike a specific financial institution at a time, switching to a differe

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new strain of Android malware has been spotted in the wild targeting online banking and cryptocurrency wallet customers in Spain and Italy, just weeks after a coordinated law enforcement operation dismantled&nbsp; FluBot .  The information stealing trojan, codenamed&nbsp; MaliBot &nbsp;by F5 Labs, is as feature-rich as its&nbsp; counterparts , allowing it to steal credentials and cookies, bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes, and abuse Android's Accessibility Service to monitor the victim's device screen.  MaliBot is known to primarily disguise itself as cryptocurrency mining apps such as Mining X or The CryptoApp that are distributed via fraudulent websites designed to attract potential visitors into downloading them.   It also takes another leaf out of the mobile banking trojan playbook in that it employs smishing as a distribution vector to proliferate the malware by accessing an infected smartphone's contacts and sending SMS messages containing links to the malware.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new covert Linux kernel rootkit named&nbsp; Syslogk &nbsp;has been spotted under development in the wild and cloaking a malicious payload that can be remotely commandeered by an adversary using a&nbsp; magic network traffic packet .  "The Syslogk rootkit is heavily based on Adore-Ng but incorporates new functionalities making the user-mode application and the kernel rootkit hard to detect," Avast security researchers David Álvarez and Jan Neduchal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Monday.  Adore-Ng, an&nbsp; open-source rootkit &nbsp;available since 2004, equips the attacker with full control over a compromised system. It also facilitates hiding processes as well as custom malicious artifacts, files, and even the kernel module, making it harder to detect.   "The module starts by hooking itself into various file systems. It digs up the inode for the root filesystem, and replaces that inode's&nbsp; readdir() &nbsp;function pointer with one of its own," LWN.net&nbsp; noted &nbsp;at the time. "The Adore ver

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off what they call a "nearly-impossible-to-detect" Linux malware that could be weaponized to backdoor infected systems.  Dubbed&nbsp; Symbiote &nbsp;by threat intelligence firms BlackBerry and Intezer, the stealthy malware is so named for its ability to conceal itself within running processes and network traffic and drain a victim's resources like a&nbsp; parasite .  The operators behind Symbiote are believed to have commenced development on the malware in November 2021, with the threat actor predominantly using it to target the financial sector in Latin America, including banks like Banco do Brasil and Caixa.  "Symbiote's main objective is to capture credentials and to facilitate backdoor access to a victim's machine," researchers Joakim Kennedy and Ismael Valenzuela said in a report  shared with The Hacker News. "What makes Symbiote different from other Linux malware is that it infects running processes rather than

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Image Source:&nbsp;Toptal  The notorious Emotet malware has turned to deploy a new module designed to siphon credit card information stored in the Chrome web browser.  The credit card stealer, which exclusively singles out Chrome, has the ability to exfiltrate the collected information to different remote command-and-control (C2) servers, according to enterprise security company&nbsp; Proofpoint , which observed the component on June 6.  The development comes amid a&nbsp; spike &nbsp;in&nbsp; Emotet &nbsp; activity &nbsp;since it was resurrected late last year following a 10-month-long hiatus in the wake of a law enforcement operation that&nbsp; took down its attack infrastructure &nbsp;in January 2021.  Emotet, attributed to a threat actor known as TA542 (aka Mummy Spider or Gold Crestwood), is an advanced, self-propagating and modular trojan that's delivered via email campaigns and is used as a distributor for other payloads such as ransomware.   As of April 2022, Emotet is still the most popular malware with a global impac

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Parrot traffic direction system (TDS) that came to light earlier this year has had a larger impact than previously thought, according to new research.  Sucuri, which has been tracking the same campaign since February 2019 under the name "NDSW/NDSX," said that "the malware was one of the top infections" detected in 2021, accounting for more than 61,000 websites.  Parrot TDS was&nbsp; documented &nbsp;in April 2022 by Czech cybersecurity company Avast, noting that the PHP script had ensnared web servers hosting more than 16,500 websites to act as a gateway for further attack campaigns.  This involves appending a piece of malicious code to all JavaScript files on compromised web servers hosting content management systems (CMS) such as WordPress that are in turn said to be breached by taking advantage of weak login credentials and vulnerable plugins.   Besides using different obfuscation tactics to conceal the code, the "injected JavaScript may also be found well indent

Watch Out! Researchers Spot New Microsoft Office Zero-Day Exploit in the Wild<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/watch-out-researchers-spot-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a zero-day flaw in Microsoft Office that could be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution on affected Windows systems.  The vulnerability came to light after an independent cybersecurity research team known as nao_sec uncovered a Word document (" 05-2022-0438.doc ") that was uploaded to VirusTotal from an IP address in Belarus.  "It uses Word's external link to load the HTML and then uses the 'ms-msdt' scheme to execute PowerShell code," the researchers&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in a series of tweets last week.   According to security researcher Kevin Beaumont, who dubbed the flaw "Follina," the maldoc leverages Word's&nbsp; remote template &nbsp;feature to fetch an HTML file from a server, which then makes use of the "ms-msdt://" URI scheme to run the malicious payload.  The shortcoming has been so named because the malicious sample references 0438, which is the area code of Follina, a municipality in t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malvertising threat is witnessing a new surge in activity since its emergence earlier this year.  Dubbed ChromeLoader , the malware is a "pervasive and persistent browser hijacker that modifies its victims' browser settings and redirects user traffic to advertisement websites," Aedan Russell of Red Canary&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.  ChromeLoader is a rogue Chrome browser extension and is typically distributed in the form of ISO files via pay-per-install sites and baited social media posts that advertise QR codes to cracked video games and pirated movies.   While it primarily functions by hijacking user search queries to Google, Yahoo, and Bing and redirecting traffic to an advertising site, it's also notable for its use of PowerShell to inject itself into the browser and get the extension added.   The malware, also known as Choziosi Loader, was first documented by G DATA earlier this February.   "For now the only purpose is getting revenue via unsolicited adverti

Malware is an industry, and professional developers are found to exchange, be it by stealing one's code or deliberate collaboration. Attacks are multi-layer these days, with diverse sophisticated software apps taking over different jobs along the attack-chain from initial compromise to ultimate data exfiltration or encryption. The specific tools for each stage are highly specialized and can often be rented as a service, including customer support and subscription models for professional (ab)use. Obviously, this has largely increased both the availability and the potential effectiveness and impact of malware. Sound scary?&nbsp;  Well, it does, but the apparent professionalization actually does have some good sides too. One factor is that certain reused modules commonly found in malware can be used to identify, track, and analyze professional attack software. Ultimately this means that

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple versions of a WordPress plugin by the name of "School Management Pro" harbored a backdoor that could grant an adversary complete control over vulnerable websites.  The issue, spotted in premium versions before 9.9.7, has been assigned the CVE identifier&nbsp; CVE-2022-1609 &nbsp;and is rated 10 out of 10 for severity.  The backdoor, which is believed to have existed since version 8.9, enables "an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on sites with the plugin installed," Jetpack's Harald Eilertsen&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Friday write-up.   School Management, developed by an India-based company called&nbsp; Weblizar , is billed as a Wordpress add-on to "manage complete school operation." It also claims more than 340,000 customers of its premium and free WordPress themes and plugins.  The WordPress security company noted that it uncovered the implant on May 4 after it was alerted to the presence of heavily obfuscated code in the license-checking code of t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Linux botnet malware known as XorDdos  has witnessed a 254% surge in activity over the last six months, according to latest research from Microsoft.  The trojan, so named for carrying out denial-of-service attacks on Linux systems and its use of XOR-based encryption for communications with its command-and-control (C2) server, is&nbsp; known &nbsp;to have been&nbsp; active &nbsp;since at least 2014.  "XorDdos' modular nature provides attackers with a versatile trojan capable of infecting a variety of Linux system architectures," Ratnesh Pandey, Yevgeny Kulakov, and Jonathan Bar Or of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an exhaustive deep-dive of the malware.   "Its SSH brute-force attacks are a relatively simple yet effective technique for gaining root access over a number of potential targets."  Remote control over vulnerable IoT and other internet-connected devices is gained by means of secure shell (SSH) brute-force attacks, enabling the malware to form a botnet

Microsoft Warns of "Cryware" Info-Stealing Malware Targeting Crypto Wallets<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/microsoft-warns-of-cryware-info.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning of an emerging threat targeting internet-connected cryptocurrency wallets, signaling a departure in the use of digital coins in cyberattacks.  The tech giant dubbed the new threat "cryware," with the attacks resulting in the irreversible theft of virtual currencies by means of fraudulent transfers to an adversary-controlled wallet.  "Cryware are information stealers that collect and exfiltrate data directly from non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets, also known as&nbsp; hot wallets ," Berman Enconado and Laurie Kirk of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.&nbsp;  "Because hot wallets, unlike custodial wallets, are stored locally on a device and provide easier access to cryptographic keys needed to perform transactions, more and more threats are targeting them."   Attacks of this kind are not theoretical. Earlier this year, Kaspersky&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a financially-motivated campaign staged by the North Korea-based Lazarus Gr

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new variant of the macOS malware tracked as UpdateAgent has been spotted in the wild, indicating ongoing attempts on the part of its authors to upgrade its functionalities.  "Perhaps one of the most identifiable features of the malware is that it relies on the AWS infrastructure to host its various payloads and perform its infection status updates to the server," researchers from Jamf Threat Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.   UpdateAgent, first detected in late 2020, has since&nbsp; evolved &nbsp;into a malware dropper, facilitating the distribution of second-stage payloads such as adware while also bypassing macOS&nbsp; Gatekeeper &nbsp;protections.   The newly discovered Swift-based dropper masquerades as Mach-O binaries named " PDFCreator " and " ActiveDirectory " that, upon execution, establish a connection to a remote server and retrieve a bash script to be executed.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have detailed a previously undocumented .NET-based post-exploitation framework called IceApple that has been deployed on Microsoft Exchange server instances to facilitate reconnaissance and data exfiltration.  "Suspected to be the work of a state-nexus adversary, IceApple remains under active development, with 18 modules observed in use across a number of enterprise environments, as of May 2022," CrowdStrike&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report.   The cybersecurity firm, which discovered the sophisticated malware in late 2021, noted its presence in multiple victim networks and in geographically distinct locations. Targeted victims span a wide range of sectors, including technology, academic, and government entities.  A post-exploitation toolset, as the name implies, is not used to provide initial access, but is rather employed to carry out follow-on attacks after having already compromised the hosts in question.

Malicious NPM Packages Target German Companies in Supply Chain Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/malicious-npm-packages-target-german.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a number of malicious packages in the NPM registry specifically targeting a number of prominent media, logistics, and industrial firms based in Germany to carry out&nbsp; supply chain attacks .  "Compared with most malware found in the NPM repository, this payload seems particularly dangerous: a highly-sophisticated, obfuscated piece of malware that acts as a backdoor and allows the attacker to take total control over the infected machine," researchers from JFrog&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.  The DevOps company said that evidence points to it being either the work of a sophisticated threat actor or a "very aggressive" penetration test.   All the rogue packages, most of which have since been removed from the repository, have been traced to four "maintainers" - bertelsmannnpm, boschnodemodules, stihlnodemodules, and dbschenkernpm — indicating an attempt to impersonate legitimate firms like Bertelsmann, Bosch, Stihl, and DB Sc

Cybersecurity researchers have dissected the inner workings of an information-stealing malware called Saintstealer  that's designed to siphon credentials and system information.  "After execution, the stealer extracts username, passwords, credit card details, etc.," Cyble researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis last week. "The stealer also steals data from various locations across the system and compresses it in a password-protected ZIP file."  A 32-bit C# .NET-based executable with the name "saintgang.exe," Saintstealer is equipped with anti-analysis checks, opting to terminate itself if it's running either in a sandboxed or virtual environment.   The malware can capture a wide range of information that ranges from taking screenshots to gathering passwords, cookies, and autofill data stored in Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Opera, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, and Yandex, among others.  It can also steal Discord multi-factor authentication toke

"Unlike the well-funded, massive Russian threat groups crafting custom malware [...], this remote access Trojan (RAT) appears to be the work of a lone actor, offering a surprisingly effective homemade tool for opening backdoors on a budget," BlackBerry researchers said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.  "In fact, this threat actor's commercial RAT sells at a fraction of the standard price such tools command on Russian underground forums."  Written in .NET by an individual codenamed "boldenis44" and "crystalcoder," DCRat is a full-featured backdoor whose functionalities can be further augmented by third-party plugins developed by affiliates using a dedicated integrated

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new set of trojanized apps spread via the Google Play Store has been observed distributing the notorious Joker malware on compromised Android devices.  Joker, a&nbsp; repeat &nbsp; offender , refers to a class of harmful apps that are used for billing and SMS fraud, while also performing a number of actions of a malicious hacker's choice, such as stealing text messages, contact lists, and device information.  Despite continued attempts on the part of Google to scale up its defenses, the apps have been continually iterated to search for gaps and slip into the app store undetected.   "They're usually spread on Google Play, where scammers download legitimate apps from the store, add malicious code to them and re-upload them to the store under a different name," Kaspersky researcher Igor Golovin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.  The trojanized apps, taking the place of their removed counterparts, often appear as messaging, health tracking, and PDF scanner apps that, once

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malicious campaign has been spotted taking advantage of Windows event logs to stash chunks of shellcode for the first time in the wild.  "It allows the 'fileless' last stage trojan to be hidden from plain sight in the file system," Kaspersky researcher Denis Legezo&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published this week.  The stealthy infection process, not attributed to a known actor, is believed to have commenced in September 2021 when the intended targets were lured into downloading compressed .RAR files containing Cobalt Strike and&nbsp; Silent Break .   The adversary simulation software modules are then used as a launchpad to inject code into Windows system processes or trusted applications.  Also notable is the use of anti-detection wrappers as part of the toolset, suggesting an attempt on the part of the operators to fly under the radar.   One of the key methods is to keep encrypted shellcode containing the next-stage malware as 8KB pieces in event logs, a never-b

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new Windows malware with worm-like capabilities and is propagated by means of removable USB devices.  Attributing the malware to a cluster named " Raspberry Robin ," Red Canary researchers&nbsp; noted &nbsp;that the worm "leverages Windows Installer to reach out to QNAP-associated domains and download a malicious DLL."  The earliest signs of the activity are said to date back to September 2021, with infections observed in organizations with ties to technology and manufacturing sectors.   Attack chains pertaining to Raspberry Robin start with connecting an infected USB drive to a Windows machine. Present within the device is the worm payload, which appears as a .LNK shortcut file to a legitimate folder.   The worm then takes care of spawning a new process using cmd.exe to read and execute a malicious file stored on the external drive.  This is followed by launching explorer.exe and msiexec.exe, the latter of which is used for extern

New BotenaGo Malware Variant Targeting Lilin Security Camera DVR Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/new-botenago-malware-variant-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new variant of an IoT botnet called BotenaGo has emerged in the wild, specifically singling out Lilin security camera DVR devices to infect them with Mirai malware.  Dubbed " Lilin Scanner " by Nozomi Networks, the&nbsp; latest version &nbsp;is designed to exploit a two-year-old critical&nbsp; command injection vulnerability &nbsp;in the DVR firmware that was patched by the Taiwanese company in February 2020.   BotenaGo , first documented in November 2021 by AT&amp;T Alien Labs, is written in Golang and features over 30 exploits for known vulnerabilities in web servers, routers and other kinds of IoT devices.  The botnet's source code has since been uploaded to GitHub, making it ripe for abuse by other criminal actors. "With only 2,891 lines of code, BotenaGo has the potential to be the starting point for many new variants and new malware families using its source code," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;this year.  The new BotenaGo malware is the&nbsp; latest &nbsp;to exploit vulnerabilities in Lil

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new set of phishing attacks delivering the more_eggs  malware has been observed striking corporate hiring managers with bogus resumes as an infection vector, a year after potential candidates looking for work on LinkedIn were lured with weaponized job offers .  "This year the more_eggs operation has flipped the social engineering script, targeting hiring managers with fake resumes instead of targeting jobseekers with fake job offers," eSentire's research and reporting lead, Keegan Keplinger, said in a statement .   The Canadian cybersecurity company said it identified and disrupted four separate security incidents, three of which occurred at the end of March. Targeted entities include a U.S.-based aerospace company, an accounting business located in the U.K., a law firm, and a staffing agency, both based out of Canada.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new version of the SolarMarker malware that packs in new improvements with the goal of updating its defense evasion abilities and staying under the radar.  "The recent version demonstrated an evolution from Windows Portable Executables (EXE files) to working with Windows installer package files (MSI files)," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this month. "This campaign is still in development and going back to using executables files (EXE) as it did in its earlier versions."  SolarMarker, also called Jupyter, leverages manipulated search engine optimization (SEO) tactics as its primary infection vector. It's known for its information stealing and backdoor features, enabling the attackers to steal data stored in web browsers and execute arbitrary commands retrieved from a remote server.   In February 2022, the operators of SolarMarker were&nbsp; observed &nbsp;using stealthy Windows Registry trick

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Chinese-backed Hafnium hacking group has been linked to a piece of a new malware that's used to maintain persistence on compromised Windows environments.  The threat actor is said to have targeted entities in the telecommunication, internet service provider and data services sectors from August 2021 to February 2022, expanding from the initial victimology patterns observed during its attacks exploiting the then zero-day flaws in&nbsp; Microsoft Exchange Servers &nbsp;in March 2021.  Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), which dubbed the defense evasion malware " Tarrask ," characterized it as a tool that creates "hidden" scheduled tasks on the system. "Scheduled task abuse is a very common method of persistence and defense evasion — and an enticing one, at that," the researchers&nbsp; said .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are warning of two different information-stealing malware, named&nbsp; FFDroider &nbsp;and&nbsp; Lightning Stealer , that are capable of siphoning data and launching further attacks.  "Designed to send stolen credentials and cookies to a Command &amp; Control server, FFDroider disguises itself on victim's machines to look like the instant messaging application 'Telegram,'" Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Avinash Kumar and Niraj Shivtarkar&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.  Information stealers, as the name implies, are equipped to harvest sensitive information from compromised machines, such as keystrokes, screenshots, files, saved passwords and cookies from web browsers, that are then transmitted to a remote attacker-controlled domain.&nbsp;   FFDroider is distributed through cracked versions of installers and freeware with the primary objective of stealing cookies and credentials associated with popular social media and e-commerce platforms and using

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A number of rogue Android apps that have been cumulatively installed from the official Google Play Store more than 50,000 times are being used to target banks and other financial entities.  The rental banking trojan, dubbed&nbsp; Octo , is said to be a rebrand of another Android malware called ExobotCompact, which, in turn, is a "lite" replacement for its Exobot predecessor, Dutch mobile security firm ThreatFabric&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Exobot is also likely said to have paved the way for a separate descendant called Coper, that was initially&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;targeting Colombian users around July 2021, with newer infections targeting Android users in different European Countries.  "Coper malware apps are modular in design and include a multi-stage infection method and many defensive tactics to survive removal attempts," Cybersecurity company Cyble&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in an analysis of the malware last month.

First Malware Targeting AWS Lambda Serverless Platform Discovered<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/first-malware-targeting-aws-lambda.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A first-of-its-kind malware targeting Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Lambda serverless computing platform has been discovered in the wild.  Dubbed "Denonia" after the name of the domain it communicates with, "the malware uses newer address resolution techniques for command and control traffic to evade typical detection measures and virtual network access controls," Cado Labs researcher Matt Muir&nbsp; said .   The&nbsp; artifact &nbsp;analyzed by the cybersecurity company was uploaded to the VirusTotal database on February 25, 2022, sporting the name "python" and packaged as a 64-bit&nbsp; ELF &nbsp;executable.  However, the filename is a misnomer, as Denonia is programmed in Go and harbors a customized variant of the XMRig cryptocurrency mining software. That said, the mode of initial access is unknown, although it's suspected it may have involved the compromise of AWS Access and Secret Keys.   Another notable feature of the malware is its use of DNS over HTTPS ( DoH ) for c

<details>

As many as seven malicious Android apps discovered on the Google Play Store masqueraded as antivirus solutions to deploy a banking trojan called SharkBot .  "SharkBot steals credentials and banking information," Check Point researchers Alex Shamshur and Raman Ladutska&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This malware implements a geofencing feature and evasion techniques, which makes it stand out from the rest of malwares."   Particularly, the malware is designed to ignore users from China, India, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The rogue apps are said to have been installed more than 15,000 times prior to their removal, with most of the victims located in Italy and the U.K.  The report complements&nbsp; previous findings &nbsp;from NCC Group, which found the bankbot posing as antivirus apps to carry out unauthorized transactions via Automatic Transfer Systems (ATS).

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a "simple but efficient" persistence mechanism adopted by a relatively nascent malware loader called Colibri , which has been observed deploying a Windows information stealer known as Vidar as part of a new campaign.  "The attack starts with a malicious Word document deploying a Colibri bot that then delivers the Vidar Stealer," Malwarebytes Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis. "The document contacts a remote server at (securetunnel[.]co) to load a remote template named 'trkal0.dot' that contacts a malicious macro," the researchers added.  First documented by&nbsp; FR3D.HK &nbsp;and Indian cybersecurity company CloudSEK earlier this year, Colibri is a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platform that's engineered to drop additional payloads onto compromised systems. Early signs of the loader appeared on Russian underground forums in August 2021.  "This loader has multiple techniques that help avoid detection," CloudSEK r

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors have been distributing malicious applications under the guise of seemingly harmless shopping apps to target customers of eight Malaysian banks since at least November 2021.  The attacks involved setting up fraudulent but legitimate-looking websites to trick users into downloading the apps, Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The copycat websites impersonated cleaning services such as Maid4u, Grabmaid, Maria's Cleaning, Maid4u, YourMaid, Maideasy and MaidACall and a pet store named PetsMore, all of which are aimed at users in Malaysia.   "The threat actors use these fake e-shop applications to phish for banking credentials," ESET&nbsp; said . "The apps also forward all SMS messages received by the victim to the malware operators in case they contain 2FA codes sent by the bank."   The targeted banks include Maybank, Affin Bank, Public Bank Berhad, CIMB bank, BSN, RHB, Bank Islam Malaysia, and Hong Leong Bank.  Th

New Malware Loader 'Verblecon' Infects Hacked PCs with Cryptocurrency Miners<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/new-malware-loader-verblecon-infects.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unidentified threat actor has been observed employing a "complex and powerful" malware loader with the ultimate objective of deploying cryptocurrency miners on compromised systems and potentially facilitating the theft of Discord tokens.  "The evidence found on victim networks appears to indicate that the goal of the attacker was to install cryptocurrency mining software on victim machines," researchers from the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom Software,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.   "This would appear to be a relatively low-reward goal for the attacker given the level of effort that would have been required to develop this sophisticated malware."  This advanced piece of malware, dubbed Verblecon, is said to have been first spotted two months ago in January 2022, with the payload incorporating&nbsp; polymorphic qualities &nbsp;to evade signature-based detections by security software.  In addition, the loader carries out further a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have shed more light on a malicious loader that runs as a server and executes received modules in memory, laying bare the structure of an "advanced multi-layered virtual machine" used by the malware to fly under the radar.  Wslink, as the malicious loader is called, was first&nbsp; documented &nbsp;by Slovak cybersecurity company ESET in October 2021, with very few telemetry hits detected in the past two years spanning Central Europe, North America, and the Middle East.   Analysis of the malware samples have yielded little to no clues about the initial compromise vector used, and no code, functionality, or operational similarities have been uncovered to suggest that this is a tool from a previously identified threat actor.  Packed with a file compression utility named NsPack, Wslink makes use of what's called a&nbsp; process virtual machine &nbsp;(VM), a mechanism to run an application in a platform-independent manner that abstracts the underlying hardware or opera

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Before hunting malware, every researcher needs to find a system where to analyze it. There are several ways to do it: build your own environment or use third-party solutions. Today we will walk through all the steps of creating a custom malware sandbox where you can perform a proper analysis without infecting your computer. And then compare it with a ready-made service.  Why do you need a malware sandbox?&nbsp;  A sandbox allows detecting cyber threats and analyzing them safely. All information remains secure, and a suspicious file can't access the system. You can monitor malware processes, identify their patterns and investigate behavior.  Before setting up a sandbox, you should have a clear goal of what you want to achieve through the lab.&nbsp;  There are two ways how to organize your working space for analysis:   Custom sandbox. &nbsp;Made from scratch by an analyst on their own, specifically for their needs.

A new large scale supply chain attack has been observed targeting Azure developers with no less than 218 malicious NPM packages with the goal of stealing personal identifiable information.  "After manually inspecting some of these packages, it became apparent that this was a targeted attack against the entire&nbsp; @azure NPM scope , by an attacker that employed an automatic script to create accounts and upload malicious packages that cover the entirety of that scope," JFrog researchers Andrey Polkovnychenko and Shachar Menashe&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.  The entire set of malicious packages was disclosed to the NPM maintainers roughly two days after they were published, leading to their quick removal, but not before each of the packages were downloaded around 50 times on average.   The attack refers to what's called typosquatting, which takes place when bad actors push rogue packages with names mimicking legitimate libraries to a public software registry such as NPM or PyPI wit

Researchers have disclosed details of a newly discovered macOS variant of a malware implant developed by a Chinese espionage threat actor known to strike attack organizations across Asia.  Attributing the attacks to a group tracked as&nbsp; Storm Cloud , cybersecurity firm Volexity characterized the new malware, dubbed&nbsp; Gimmick , a "feature-rich, multi-platform malware family that uses public cloud hosting services (such as Google Drive) for command-and-control (C2) channels."  The cybersecurity firm said it recovered the sample through memory analysis of a compromised MacBook Pro running macOS 11.6 (Big Sur) as part of an intrusion campaign that took place in late 2021.   "Storm Cloud is an advanced and versatile threat actor, adapting its tool set to match different operating systems used by its targets," Volexity researchers Damien Cash, Steven Adair, and Thomas Lancaster&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Wednesday detailed a previously undiscovered technique put to use by the TrickBot malware that involves using compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices as a go-between for establishing communications with the command-and-control (C2) servers.  "By using MikroTik routers as proxy servers for its C2 servers and redirecting the traffic through non-standard ports, TrickBot adds another persistence layer that helps malicious IPs evade detection by standard security systems," Microsoft's Defender for IoT Research Team and Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)&nbsp; said .   TrickBot, which emerged as a banking trojan in 2016, has evolved into a sophisticated and persistent threat, with its modular architecture enabling it to adapt its tactics to suit different networks, environments, and devices as well as offer access-as-a-service for next-stage payloads like Conti ransomware.

CaddyWiper: Yet Another Data Wiping Malware Targeting Ukrainian Networks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/caddywiper-yet-another-data-wiping.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two weeks after details emerged about a second data wiper strain delivered in attacks against Ukraine, yet another destructive malware has been detected amid Russia's continuing military invasion of the country.  Slovak cybersecurity company ESET dubbed the third wiper " CaddyWiper ," which it said it first observed on March 14 around 9:38 a.m. UTC. Metadata associated with the executable (" caddy.exe ") shows that the malware was compiled at 7:19 a.m. UTC, a little over two hours prior to its deployment.  CaddyWiper is notable for the fact that it doesn't share any similarities with previously discovered wipers in Ukraine, including&nbsp; HermeticWiper &nbsp;(aka FoxBlade or KillDisk) and&nbsp; IsaacWiper &nbsp;(aka Lasainraw), the two of which have been deployed in systems belonging to government and commercial entities.   "The ultimate goal of the attackers is the same  as with IsaacWiper and HermeticWiper: make the systems unusable by erasing user data and partition i

SharkBot Banking Malware Spreading via Fake Android Antivirus App on Google Play Store<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/sharkbot-banking-malware-spreading-via.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor behind a nascent Android banking trojan named&nbsp; SharkBot &nbsp;has managed to evade Google Play Store security barriers by masquerading as an antivirus app.  SharkBot, like its malware counterparts&nbsp; TeaBot ,&nbsp; FluBot , and&nbsp; Oscorp &nbsp;(UBEL), belongs to a category of financial trojans capable of siphoning credentials to initiate money transfers from compromised devices by circumventing multi-factor authentication mechanisms. It first emerged on the scene in November 2021.  Where SharkBot stands apart is in its ability to carry out the unauthorized transactions via Automatic Transfer Systems (ATS), which stands in contrast to TeaBot, which requires a live operator to interact with the infected devices to conduct the malicious activities.   "The ATS features allow the malware to receive a list of events to be simulated, and they will be simulated in order to do the money transfers," Alberto Segura and Rolf Govers, malware analysts at cybersecurity firm NCC Group,&nbsp; said

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Android banking trojan designed to steal credentials and SMS messages has been observed once again sneaking past Google Play Store protections to target users of more than 400 banking and financial apps, including those from Russia, China, and the U.S.  "TeaBot RAT capabilities are achieved via the device screen's live streaming (requested on-demand) plus the abuse of Accessibility Services for remote interaction and key-logging," Cleafy researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "This enables Threat Actors (TAs) to perform ATO (Account Takeover) directly from the compromised phone, also known as 'On-device fraud.'"   Also known by the name Anatsa, TeaBot first&nbsp; emerged &nbsp;in May 2021, camouflaging its malicious functions by posing as seemingly innocuous PDF document and QR code scanner apps that are distributed via the official Google Play Store instead of third-party apps stores or via fraudulent websites.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Iranian geopolitical nexus threat actor has been uncovered deploying two new targeted malware that come with "simple" backdoor functionalities as part of an intrusion against an unnamed Middle East government entity in November 2021.  Cybersecurity company Mandiant attributed the attack to an uncategorized cluster it's tracking under the moniker&nbsp; UNC3313 , which it assesses with "moderate confidence" as associated with the MuddyWater state-sponsored group.  "UNC3313 conducts surveillance and collects strategic information to support Iranian interests and decision-making," researchers Ryan Tomcik, Emiel Haeghebaert, and Tufail Ahmed&nbsp; said . "Targeting patterns and related lures demonstrate a strong focus on targets with a geopolitical nexus."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware capable of controlling social media accounts is being distributed through Microsoft's official app store in the form of trojanized gaming apps, infecting more than 5,000 Windows machines in Sweden, Bulgaria, Russia, Bermuda, and Spain.  Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point dubbed the malware "Electron Bot," in reference to a command-and-control (C2) domain used in recent campaigns. The identity of the attackers is not known, but evidence suggests that they could be based out of Bulgaria.  "Electron Bot is a modular SEO poisoning malware, which is used for social media promotion and click fraud," Check Point's Moshe Marelus&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. "It is mainly distributed via the Microsoft store platform and dropped from dozens of infected applications, mostly games, which are constantly uploaded by the attackers."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a previously undocumented and stealthy custom malware called SockDetour  that targeted U.S.-based defense contractors with the goal of being used as a secondary implant on compromised Windows hosts.  "SockDetour is a backdoor that is designed to remain stealthily on compromised Windows servers so that it can serve as a backup backdoor in case the primary one fails," Palo Alto Networks' Unit 41 threat intelligence&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Thursday. "It is difficult to detect, since it operates filelessly and socketlessly on compromised Windows servers."  Even more concerningly, SockDetour is believed to have been used in attacks since at least July 2019, based on a compilation timestamp on the sample, implying that the backdoor successfully managed to slip past detection for over two-and-a-half years.   The attacks have been attributed to a threat cluster it tracks as&nbsp; TiltedTemple &nbsp;(aka DEV-0322 by Microsof

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity firms ESET  and Broadcom's Symantec  said they discovered a new data wiper malware used in fresh attacks against hundreds of machines in Ukraine, as Russian forces formally launched a full-scale  military operation  against the country.  The Slovak company dubbed the wiper " HermeticWiper " (aka&nbsp; KillDisk.NCV ), with one of the malware samples compiled on December 28, 2021, implying that preparations for the attacks may have been underway for nearly two months.  "The wiper binary is signed using a code signing certificate issued to Hermetica Digital Ltd," ESET said in a series of tweets. "The wiper abuses legitimate drivers from the EaseUS Partition Master software in order to corrupt data. As a final step the wiper reboots [the] computer."   Specifically, HermeticWiper is delivered  via the benign but signed EaseUS partition management driver that then proceeds to impair the first 512 bytes, the Master Boot Record ( MBR ) for every phys

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Similarities have been unearthed between the Dridex  general-purpose malware and a little-known ransomware strain called Entropy , suggesting that the operators are continuing to rebrand their extortion operations under a different name.  "The similarities are in the software packer used to conceal the ransomware code, in the malware subroutines designed to find and obfuscate commands (API calls), and in the subroutines used to decrypt encrypted text," cybersecurity firm Sophos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The commonalities were uncovered following two unrelated incidents targeting an unnamed media company and a regional government agency. In both cases, the deployment of Entropy was preceded by infecting the target networks with Cobalt Strike Beacons and Dridex, granting the attackers remote access.  Despite consistency in some aspects of the twin attacks, they also varied significantly with regards to the initial access vector used to worm their way ins

Researchers from China's Pangu Lab have disclosed details of a "top-tier" backdoor put to use by the Equation Group , an advanced persistent threat (APT) with alleged ties to the cyber-warfare intelligence-gathering unit of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).  Dubbed " Bvp47 " owing to numerous references to the string "Bvp" and the numerical value "0x47" used in the encryption algorithm, the backdoor was extracted from Linux systems "during an in-depth forensic investigation of a host in a key domestic department" in 2013.  Pangu Lab codenamed the attacks involving the deployment of Bvp47 "Operation Telescreen," with the implant featuring an "advanced covert channel behavior based on TCP SYN packets, code obfuscation, system hiding, and self-destruction design."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Numerous Windows machines located in South Korea have been targeted by a botnet tracked as PseudoManuscrypt  since at least May 2021 by employing the same delivery tactics of another malware called CryptBot .  "PseudoManuscrypt is disguised as an installer that is similar to a form of&nbsp; CryptBot , and is being distributed," South Korean cybersecurity company AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today.  "Not only is its file form similar to CryptBot, but it is also distributed via malicious sites exposed on the top search page when users search commercial software-related illegal programs such as Crack and Keygen," it added.  According to ASEC, around 30 computers in the country are being consistently infected on a daily basis on average.

The notorious TrickBot malware is targeting customers of 60 financial and technology companies, including cryptocurrency firms, primarily located in the U.S., even as its operators have updated the botnet with new anti-analysis features.  "TrickBot is a sophisticated and versatile malware with more than 20 modules that can be downloaded and executed on demand," Check Point researchers Aliaksandr Trafimchuk and Raman Ladutska&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today.   In addition to being both prevalent and persistent, TrickBot has&nbsp; continually &nbsp; evolved &nbsp;its tactics to go past security and detection layers. To that end, the malware's "injectDll" web-injects module, which is responsible for stealing banking and credential data, leverages anti-deobfuscation techniques to crash the web page and thwart attempts to scrutinize the source code.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new version of the MyloBot malware has been observed to deploy malicious payloads that are being used to send sextortion emails demanding victims to pay $2,732 in digital currency.  MyloBot , first detected in 2018, is known to&nbsp; feature &nbsp;an array of sophisticated anti-debugging capabilities and propagation techniques to rope infected machines into a botnet, not to mention remove traces of other competing malware from the systems.  Chief among its methods to evade detection and stay under the radar included a delay of 14 days before accessing its command-and-control servers and the facility to execute malicious binaries directly from memory.   MyloBot also leverages a technique called&nbsp; process hollowing , wherein the attack code is injected into a suspended and hollowed process in order to circumvent process-based defenses. This is achieved by unmapping the memory allocated to the live process and replacing it with the arbitrary code to be executed, in this case a decoded resource fi

A financially motivated campaign that targets Android devices and spreads mobile malware via SMS phishing techniques since at least 2018 has spread its tentacles to strike victims located in France and&nbsp; Germany &nbsp;for the first time.  Dubbed&nbsp; Roaming Mantis , the latest spate of activities observed in 2021 involve sending fake shipping-related texts containing a URL to a landing page from where Android users are infected with a banking trojan known as Wroba whereas iPhone users are redirected to a phishing page that masquerades as the official Apple website.   The top affected countries, based on telemetry data gathered by Kaspersky between July 2021 and January 2022, are France, Japan, India, China, Germany, and Korea.  Also tracked under the names&nbsp; MoqHao &nbsp;and XLoader (not to be confused with the info-stealer malware of the same name&nbsp; targeting Windows and macOS ), the group's activity has continued to expand geographically even as the operators broadened their attack methods to m

Medusa Android Banking Trojan Spreading Through Flubot's Attacks Network<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/medusa-android-banking-trojan-spreading.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two different Android banking Trojans, FluBot and Medusa, are relying on the same delivery vehicle as part of a simultaneous attack campaign, according to new research published by ThreatFabric.  The ongoing side-by-side infections, facilitated through the same smishing (SMS phishing) infrastructure, involved the overlapping usage of "app names, package names, and similar icons," the Dutch mobile security firm said.  Medusa, first discovered targeting Turkish financial organizations in July 2020, has undergone several iterations, chief among which is the ability to abuse accessibility permissions in Android to siphon funds from banking apps to an account controlled by the attacker.  "Medusa sports other dangerous features like keylogging, accessibility event logging, and audio and video streaming — all these capabilities provide actors with almost full access to [a] victim's device," the researchers&nbsp; said .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A politically motivated advanced persistent threat (APT) group has expanded its malware arsenal to include a new remote access trojan (RAT) in its espionage attacks aimed at Indian military and diplomatic entities.  Called&nbsp; CapraRAT &nbsp;by Trend Micro, the implant is an Android RAT that exhibits a high "degree of crossover" with another Windows malware known as CrimsonRAT that's associated with Earth Karkaddan, a threat actor that's also tracked under the monikers APT36, Operation C-Major, PROJECTM, Mythic Leopard, and Transparent Tribe.  The first concrete signs of APT36's existence&nbsp; appeared &nbsp;in&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp;as the group began distributing information-stealing malware through phishing emails with malicious PDF attachments targeting Indian military and government personnel. The group is believed to be of&nbsp; Pakistani origin &nbsp;and operational since at least 2013.   The threat actor is also known to be consistent in its modus operandi, with the attacks predominantly banking o

New Variant of UpdateAgent Malware Infects Mac Computers with Adware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/new-variant-of-updateagent-malware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Wednesday shed light on a previously undocumented Mac trojan that it said has undergone several iterations since its first appearance in September 2020, effectively granting it an "increasing progression of sophisticated capabilities."  The company's Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team dubbed the new malware family " UpdateAgent ," charting its evolution from a barebones information stealer to a second-stage payload distributor as part of multiple attack waves observed in 2021.   "The latest campaign saw the malware installing the evasive and persistent Adload adware, but UpdateAgent's ability to gain access to a device can theoretically be further leveraged to fetch other, potentially more dangerous payloads," the researchers&nbsp; said .  The actively in-development malware is said to be propagated via drive-by downloads or advertisement pop-ups that masquerade as legitimate software like video applications and support agents

New Malware Used by SolarWinds Attackers Went Undetected for Years<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/new-malware-used-by-solarwinds.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor behind the supply chain compromise of SolarWinds has continued to expand its malware arsenal with new tools and techniques that were deployed in attacks as early as 2019, once indicative of the elusive nature of the campaigns and the adversary's ability to maintain persistent access for years.  According to cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which&nbsp; detailed the novel tactics &nbsp;adopted by the Nobelium hacking group last week, two sophisticated malware families were placed on victim systems — a Linux variant of GoldMax and a new implant dubbed TrailBlazer — long before the scale of the attacks came to light.  Nobelium, the Microsoft-assigned moniker for the&nbsp; SolarWinds intrusion &nbsp;in December 2020, is also tracked by the wider cybersecurity community under the names UNC2452 (FireEye), SolarStorm (Unit 42), StellarParticle (Crowdstrike), Dark Halo (Volexity), and Iron Ritual (Secureworks).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In a sign that threat actors continuously shift tactics and update their defensive measures, the operators of the SolarMarker information stealer and backdoor have been found leveraging stealthy Windows Registry tricks to establish long-term persistence on compromised systems.  Cybersecurity firm Sophos, which spotted the new behavior, said that the remote access implants are still being detected on targeted networks despite the campaign witnessing a decline in November 2021.  Boasting of information harvesting and backdoor capabilities, the .NET-based malware has been linked to at least three different attack waves in 2021. The first set,&nbsp; reported in April , took advantage of search engine poisoning techniques to trick business professionals into visiting sketchy Google sites that installed SolarMarker on the victim's machines.   Then in August, the malware was&nbsp; observed &nbsp;targeting healthcare and education sectors with the goal of gathering credentials and sensitive information.

A financially-motivated malware campaign has compromised over 800 WordPress websites to deliver a banking trojan dubbed Chaes  targeting Brazilian customers of Banco do Brasil, Loja Integrada, Mercado Bitcoin, Mercado Livre, and Mercado Pago.  First documented by&nbsp; Cybereason &nbsp;in November 2020, the info-stealing malware is delivered via a sophisticated infection chain that's engineered to harvest sensitive consumer information, including login credentials, credit card numbers, and other financial information.  "Chaes is characterized by the multiple-stage delivery that utilizes scripting frameworks such as JScript, Python, and NodeJS, binaries written in Delphi, and malicious Google Chrome extensions," Avast researchers Anh Ho and Igor Morgenstern&nbsp; said . "The ultimate goal of Chaes is to steal credentials stored in Chrome and intercept logins of popular banking websites in Brazil."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The cybercrime operators behind the notorious TrickBot malware have once again upped the ante by fine-tuning its techniques by adding multiple layers of defense to slip past antimalware products.  "As part of that escalation, malware injections have been fitted with added protection to keep researchers out and get through security controls," IBM Trusteer&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "In most cases, these extra protections have been applied to injections used in the process of online banking fraud — TrickBot's main activity since its inception after the&nbsp; Dyre Trojan 's demise."  TrickBot , which started out as a banking trojan, has evolved into a multi-purpose crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS) that's employed by a variety of actors to deliver additional payloads such as ransomware. Over 100 variations of TrickBot have been identified to date, one of which is a " Trickboot " module that can modify the UEFI firmware of a compromised device.   In the fall of 2

Mobile Banking Trojan BRATA Gains New, Dangerous Capabilities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/mobile-banking-trojan-brata-gains-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Android malware tracked as BRATA has been updated with new features that grants it the ability to track device locations and even perform a factory reset in an apparent bid to cover up fraudulent wire transfers.  The latest variants, detected late last year, are said to be distributed through a downloader to avoid being detected by security software, Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy said in a&nbsp; technical write-up . Targets include banks and financial institutions in the U.K., Poland, Italy, and Latin America.   "What makes Android RAT so interesting for attackers is its capability to operate directly on the victim devices instead of using a new device," Cleafy researchers&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in December 2021. "By doing so, Threat Actors (TAs) can drastically reduce the possibility of being flagged "as suspicious", since the device's fingerprinting is already known to the bank."  First seen in the wild at the end of 2018 and short for "Brazilian Remote Ac

Hackers Using New Malware Packer DTPacker to Avoid Analysis, Detection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/hackers-using-new-malware-packer.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented&nbsp; malware packer &nbsp;named DTPacker has been observed distributing multiple remote access trojans (RATs) and information stealers such as Agent Tesla, Ave Maria, AsyncRAT, and FormBook to plunder information and facilitate follow-on attacks.  "The malware uses multiple obfuscation techniques to evade antivirus, sandboxing, and analysis," enterprise security company Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published Monday. "It is likely distributed on underground forums."&nbsp;   The .NET-based commodity malware has been associated with dozens of campaigns and multiple threat groups, both advanced persistent threat (APT) and cybercrime actors, since 2020, with the intrusions aimed at hundreds of customers across many sectors.  Attack chains involving the packer rely on phishing emails as an initial infection vector. The messages contain a malicious document or a compressed executable attachment, which, when opened, deploys the packer to launch the malware.

A new evasive crypto wallet stealer named BHUNT  has been spotted in the wild with the goal of financial gain, adding to a list of digital currency stealing malware such as CryptBot,&nbsp; Redline Stealer , and&nbsp; WeSteal .

Cybersecurity teams from Microsoft on Saturday disclosed they identified evidence of a new destructive malware operation targeting government, non-profit, and information technology entities in Ukraine amid brewing geopolitical tensions between the country and Russia.  "The malware is disguised as ransomware but, if activated by the attacker, would render the infected computer system inoperable," Tom Burt, corporate vice president of customer security and trust at Microsoft, said , adding the intrusions were aimed at government agencies that provide critical executive branch or emergency response functions.  Also targeted is an IT firm that "manages websites for public and private sector clients, including government agencies whose websites were recently defaced ," Burt noted.   The computing giant, which first detected the malware on January 13, attributed the attacks to an emerging threat cluster codenamed " DEV-0586 ," with no observed overlaps in tact

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new&nbsp; cross-platform backdoor &nbsp;called " SysJoker " has been observed targeting machines running Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems as part of an ongoing espionage campaign that's believed to have been initiated during the second half of 2021.  "SysJoker masquerades as a system update and generates its [command-and-control server] by decoding a string retrieved from a text file hosted on Google Drive," Intezer researchers Avigayil Mechtinger, Ryan Robinson, and Nicole Fishbein&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in a technical write-up publicizing their findings. "Based on victimology and malware's behavior, we assess that SysJoker is after specific targets."   The Israeli cybersecurity company, attributing the work to an advanced threat actor, said it first discovered evidence of the implant in December 2021 during an active attack against a Linux-based web server belonging to an unnamed educational institution.

New Trick Could Let Malware Fake iPhone Shutdown to Spy on Users Secretly<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/new-trick-could-let-malware-fake-iphone.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed a novel technique by which malware on iOS can achieve persistence on an infected device by faking its shutdown process, making it impossible to physically determine if an iPhone is off or otherwise.  The discovery — dubbed " NoReboot " — comes courtesy of mobile security firm ZecOps, which found that it's possible to block and then simulate an iOS rebooting operation, deceiving the user into believing that the phone has been powered off when, in reality, it's still running.  The San Francisco-headquartered company&nbsp; called &nbsp;it the "ultimate persistence bug […] that cannot be patched because it's not exploiting any persistence bugs at all — only playing tricks with the human mind."  NoReboot works by interfering with the routines used in iOS to shutdown and restart the device, effectively preventing them from ever happening in the first place and allowing a trojan to achieve persistence without persistence as the device is never

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing&nbsp; ZLoader &nbsp;malware campaign has been uncovered exploiting remote monitoring tools and a nine-year-old flaw concerning Microsoft's digital signature verification to siphon user credentials and sensitive information.  Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point Research, which has been tracking the sophisticated infection chain since November 2021, attributed it to a cybercriminal group dubbed&nbsp; Malsmoke , citing similarities with previous attacks.  "The techniques incorporated in the infection chain include the use of legitimate remote management software (RMM) to gain initial access to the target machine," Check Point's Golan Cohen said in a report  shared with The Hacker News. "The malware then exploits Microsoft's digital signature verification method to inject its payload into a signed system DLL to further evade the system's defenses."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously unknown rootkit has been found setting its sights on Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's Integrated Lights-Out ( iLO ) server management technology to carry out in-the-wild attacks that tamper with the firmware modules and completely wipe data off the infected systems.  The discovery, which is the first instance of real-world malware in iLO firmware, was documented by Iranian cybersecurity firm Amnpardaz this week.  "There are numerous aspects of iLO that make it an ideal utopia for malware and APT groups: Extremely high privileges (above any level of access in the operating system), very low-level access to the hardware, being totally out of the sight of the admins, and security tools, the general lack of knowledge and tools for inspecting iLO and/or protecting it, the persistence it provides for the malware to remain even after changing the operating system, and in particular being always running and never shutting down," the researchers&nbsp; said .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have discovered a new Android banking malware that targets Brazil's Itaú Unibanco with the help of lookalike Google Play Store pages to carry out fraudulent financial transactions on victim devices without their knowledge.  "This application has a similar icon and name that could trick users into thinking it is a legitimate app related to Itaú Unibanco," Cyble researchers &nbsp;said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "The [threat actor] has created a fake Google Play Store page and hosted the malware that targets Itaú Unibanco on it under the name&nbsp; 'sincronizador.apk .'"   The tactic of leveraging fake app store pages as a lure is not new. In March, Meta (previously Facebook) &nbsp;disclosed &nbsp;details of an attack campaign that used its platform as part of a broader operation to spy on Uyghur Muslims using rogue third-party websites that used replica domains for popular news portals and websites designed to resemble third-party Android app stores, where attackers put fake keyboard, pr

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple recently fixed a security vulnerability in the macOS operating system that could be potentially exploited by a threat actor to "trivially and reliably" bypass a "myriad of foundational macOS security mechanisms" and run arbitrary code.  Security researcher Patrick Wardle&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;the discovery in a series of tweets on Thursday. Tracked as CVE-2021-30853 (CVSS score: 5.5), the issue relates to a scenario where a rogue macOS app may circumvent&nbsp; Gatekeeper &nbsp;checks, which ensure that only trusted apps can be run and that they have passed an automated process called " app notarization ."  The iPhone maker, crediting Gordon Long of Box with reporting the flaw, said it&nbsp; addressed the weakness &nbsp;with improved checks as part of macOS 11.6 updates officially released on September 20, 2021.   "Such bugs are often particularly impactful to everyday macOS users as they provide a means for adware and malware authors to sidestep macOS security mechanisms, …m

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of an evasive malware campaign that makes use of valid code signing certificates to sneak past security defenses and stay under the radar with the goal of deploying Cobalt Strike and BitRAT payloads on compromised systems.  The binary, a loader, has been dubbed "Blister" by researchers from Elastic Security, with the malware samples having&nbsp; negligible &nbsp;to&nbsp; zero &nbsp;detections on VirusTotal. As of writing, the infection vector used to stage the attack, as well as the ultimate objectives of the intrusion, remains unknown.   A notable aspect of the attacks is that they leverage a valid code signing certificate issued by&nbsp; Sectigo . The malware has been observed signed with the certificate in question dating back to September 15, 2021.

A malicious Android app with more than 500,000 downloads from the Google Play app store has been found hosting malware that stealthily exfiltrates users' contact lists to an attacker-controlled server and signs up users to unwanted paid premium subscriptions without their knowledge.

In addition, it has been observed simulating clicks in order to generate revenue from malicious ads and connecting to servers located in Russia.   Color Message "accesses users' contact list and exfiltrates it over the network [and] automatically subscribes to unwanted paid services," mobile security firm Pradeo&nbsp; noted .

New PseudoManuscrypt Malware Infected Over 35,000 Computers in 2021<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/new-pseudomanuscrypt-malware-infected.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Industrial and government organizations, including enterprises in the military-industrial complex and research laboratories, are the targets of a new malware botnet dubbed&nbsp; PseudoManyscrypt &nbsp;that has infected roughly 35,000 Windows computers this year alone.  The name comes from its similarities to the&nbsp; Manuscrypt &nbsp; malware , which is part of the&nbsp; Lazarus &nbsp;APT group's attack toolset, Kaspersky researchers said, characterizing the operation as a "mass-scale spyware attack campaign." The Russian cybersecurity company said it first detected the series of intrusions in June 2021.  At least 7.2% of all computers attacked by the malware are part of industrial control systems (ICS) used by organizations in engineering, building automation, energy, manufacturing, construction, utilities, and water management sectors that are located mainly in India, Vietnam, and Russia. Approximately a third (29.4%) of non-ICS computers are situated in Russia (10.1%), India (10%), and Brazil (9.

New Fileless Malware Uses Windows Registry as Storage to Evade Detection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/new-fileless-malware-uses-windows.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new JavaScript-based remote access Trojan (RAT) propagated via a social engineering campaign has been observed employing sneaky "fileless" techniques as part of its detection-evasion methods to elude discovery and analysis.  Dubbed DarkWatchman  by researchers from Prevailion's Adversarial Counterintelligence Team (PACT), the malware uses a resilient domain generation algorithm ( DGA ) to identify its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure and utilizes the Windows Registry for all of its storage operations, thereby enabling it to bypass antimalware engines.  The RAT "utilizes novel methods for fileless persistence, on-system activity, and dynamic run-time capabilities like self-updating and recompilation," researchers Matt Stafford and Sherman Smith&nbsp; said , adding it "represents an evolution in fileless malware techniques, as it uses the registry for nearly all temporary and permanent storage and therefore never writes anything to disk, allowing it to o

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Infection chains associated with the multi-purpose Qakbot malware have been broken down into "distinct building blocks," an effort that Microsoft said will help to proactively detect and block the threat in an effective manner.  The Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team&nbsp; dubbed &nbsp; Qakbot  a "customizable chameleon that adapts to suit the needs of the multiple threat actor groups that utilize it."  Qakbot &nbsp;is believed to be the creation of a financially motivated cybercriminal threat group known as&nbsp; Gold Lagoon . It is a prevalent information-stealing malware that, in recent years, has become a precursor to many critical and widespread ransomware attacks, offering a malware installation-as-a-service that enables many campaigns.   First discovered in 2007, the modular malware — like&nbsp; TrickBot &nbsp;— has&nbsp; evolved &nbsp;from its early roots as a banking trojan to become a Swiss Army knife capable of data exfiltration and acting as a delivery mechanism for the second st

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A series of malicious campaigns have been leveraging fake installers of popular apps and games such as Viber, WeChat, NoxPlayer, and Battlefield as a lure to trick users into downloading a new backdoor and an undocumented malicious Google Chrome extension with the goal of stealing credentials and data stored in the compromised systems as well as maintaining persistent remote access.  Cisco Talos attributed the malware payloads to an unknown actor that goes by the alias " magnat ," noting that "these two families have been subject to constant development and improvement by their authors."  The attacks are believed to have commenced in late 2018, with intermittent activity observed towards the end of 2019 and through early 2020, followed by fresh spikes since April 2021, while mainly singling out users in Canada, followed by the U.S., Australia, Italy, Spain, and Norway.

E-commerce platforms in the U.S., Germany, and France have come under attack from a new form of malware that targets Nginx servers in an attempt to masquerade its presence and slip past detection by security solutions.  "This novel code injects itself into a host Nginx application and is nearly invisible," Sansec Threat Research team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "The parasite is used to steal data from eCommerce servers, also known as 'server-side Magecart.'"&nbsp;  A free and open-source software, Nginx is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. NginRAT, as the advanced malware is called, works by hijacking a host Nginx application to embed itself into the webserver process.   The remote access trojan itself is delivered via&nbsp; CronRAT , another piece of malware the Dutch cybersecurity firm disclosed last week as hiding its malicious payloads in cron jobs scheduled to execute on February 31st, a non-existent ca

Researches Detail 17 Malicious Frameworks Used to Attack Air-Gapped Networks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/researches-detail-17-malicious.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Four different malicious frameworks designed to attack air-gapped networks were detected in the first half of 2020 alone, bringing the total number of such toolkits to 17 and offering adversaries a pathway to cyber espionage and exfiltrate classified information.  "All frameworks are designed to perform some form of espionage, [and] all the frameworks used USB drives as the physical transmission medium to transfer data in and out of the targeted air-gapped networks," ESET researchers Alexis Dorais-Joncas and Facundo Muñoz&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a comprehensive study of the frameworks.  Air-gapping is a network security measure designed to prevent unauthorized access to systems by physically isolating them from other unsecured networks, including local area networks and the public internet. This also implies that the only way to transfer data is by connecting a physical device to it, such as USB drives or external hard disks.   Given that the mechanism is one of the most common ways&nbsp; SCAD

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have unearthed a new remote access trojan (RAT) for Linux that employs a never-before-seen stealth technique that involves masking its malicious actions by scheduling them for execution on February 31st, a non-existent calendar day.  Dubbed CronRAT, the sneaky malware "enables&nbsp; server-side Magecart data theft &nbsp;which bypasses browser-based security solutions," Sansec Threat Research said. The Dutch cybersecurity firm said it found samples of the RAT on several online stores, including an unnamed country's largest outlet.   CronRAT's standout feature is its ability to leverage the&nbsp; cron &nbsp;job-scheduler utility for Unix to hide malicious payloads using task names programmed to execute on February 31st. Not only does this allow the malware to evade detection from security software, but it also enables it to launch an array of attack commands that could put Linux eCommerce servers at risk.

Threat actors have been found using a previously undocumented JavaScript malware strain that functions as a loader to distribute an array of remote access Trojans (RATs) and information stealers.  HP Threat Research dubbed the new, evasive loader "RATDispenser," with the malware responsible for deploying at least eight different malware families in 2021. Around 155 samples of this new malware have been discovered, spread across three different variants, hinting that it's under active development.   "RATDispenser is used to gain an initial foothold on a system before launching secondary malware that establishes control over the compromised device," security researcher Patrick Schläpfer&nbsp; said . "All the payloads were RATs, designed to steal information and give attackers control over victim devices."  As with other attacks of this kind, the starting point of the infection is a phishing email containing a malicious attachment, which masquerades as a text

At least 9.3 million Android devices have been infected by a new class of malware that disguises itself as dozens of arcade, shooter, and strategy games on Huawei's AppGallery marketplace to steal device information and victims' mobile phone numbers.  The mobile campaign was disclosed by researchers from Doctor Web, who classified the trojan as " Android.Cynos.7.origin ," owing to the fact that the malware is a modified version of the Cynos malware. Of the total 190 rogue games  identified, some were designed to target Russian-speaking users, while others were aimed at Chinese or international audiences.   Once installed, the apps prompted the victims for permission to make and manage phone calls, using the access to harvest their phone numbers along with other device information such as geolocation, mobile network parameters, and system metadata.&nbsp;   "At first glance, a mobile phone number leak may seem like an insignificant problem.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Banking apps from Brazil are being targeted by a more elusive and stealthier version of an Android remote access trojan (RAT) that's capable of carrying out financial fraud attacks by stealing two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and initiating rogue transactions from infected devices to transfer money from victims' accounts to an account operated by the threat actor.  IBM X-Force dubbed the revamped banking malware BrazKing , a previous version of which was referred to as&nbsp; PixStealer &nbsp;by Check Point Research. The mobile RAT was first seen around November 2018,&nbsp; according &nbsp;to ThreatFabric.  "It turns out that its developers have been working on making the malware more agile than before, moving its core overlay mechanism to pull fake overlay screens from the command-and-control (C2) server in real-time," IBM X-Force researcher Shahar Tavor&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in a technical deep dive published last week.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Weaknesses in e-commerce portals are being exploited to deploy a Linux backdoor as well as a credit card skimmer that's capable of stealing payment information from compromised websites.  "The attacker started with automated e-commerce attack probes, testing for dozens of weaknesses in common online store platforms," researchers from Sansec Threat Research&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis. "After a day and a half, the attacker found a file upload vulnerability in one of the store's plugins." The name of the affected vendor was not revealed.   The initial foothold was then leveraged to upload a malicious web shell and alter the server code to siphon customer data. Additionally, the attacker delivered a Golang-based malware called " linux_avp " that serves as a backdoor to execute commands remotely sent from a command-and-control server hosted in Beijing.   Upon execution, the program is designed to remove itself from the disk and camouflage as a " ps -ef

New Blacksmith Exploit Bypasses Current Rowhammer Attack Defenses<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/new-blacksmith-exploit-bypasses-current.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have demonstrated yet another variation of the Rowhammer attack affecting all&nbsp; DRAM &nbsp;(dynamic random-access memory) chips that bypasses currently deployed mitigations, thereby effectively compromising the security of the devices.  The new technique — dubbed " Blacksmith " ( CVE-2021-42114 , CVSS score: 9.0) — is designed to trigger bit flips on target refresh rate-enabled DRAM chips with the help of novel "non-uniform and frequency-based" memory access patterns, according to a study jointly published by academics from ETH Zurich, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and Qualcomm Technologies.   Originally disclosed in 2014,&nbsp; Rowhammer &nbsp;refers to a fundamental hardware vulnerability that could be abused to alter or corrupt memory contents by taking advantage of DRAM's tightly-packed, matrix-like memory cell architecture to repeatedly access certain rows (aka "aggressors") that induces an electrical disturbance large enough to cause t

Cybersecurity researchers on Monday took the wraps off a new Android trojan that takes advantage of accessibility features on the devices to siphon credentials from banking and cryptocurrency services in Italy, the U.K., and the U.S.  Dubbed " SharkBot " by Cleafy, the malware is designed to strike a total of 27 targets — counting 22 unnamed international banks in Italy and the U.K. as well as five cryptocurrency apps in the U.S. — at least since late October 2021 and is believed to be in its early stages of development, with no overlaps found to that of any known families.   "The main goal of SharkBot is to initiate money transfers from the compromised devices via Automatic Transfer Systems (ATS) technique bypassing multi-factor authentication mechanisms (e.g., SCA)," the researchers said in a report.  "Once SharkBot is successfully installed in the victim's device, attackers can obtain sensitive banking information through the abuse of Accessibility Serv

The Dallas-based mobile security company dubbed the campaign " PhoneSpy ."   Zimperium did not attribute the spyware to a known threat actor. "The evidence surrounding PhoneSpy shows a familiar framework that has been passed around for years, updated by individuals and shared within private communities and back channels until assembled into what we see in this variation today," Richard Melick, the co

At least nine entities across the technology, defense, healthcare, energy, and education industries were compromised by leveraging a&nbsp; recently patched critical vulnerability &nbsp;in Zoho's ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus self-service password management and single sign-on (SSO) solution.

The operators behind the Mekotio banking trojan have resurfaced with a shift in its infection flow so as to stay under the radar and evade security software, while staging nearly 100 attacks over the last three months.  "One of the main characteristics […] is the modular attack which gives the attackers the ability to change only a small part of the whole in order to avoid detection," researchers from Check Point Research said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The latest wave of attacks are said to primarily target victims located in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Spain.  The development comes after Spanish law enforcement agencies in July 2021&nbsp; arrested &nbsp;16 individuals belonging to a criminal network in connection with operating Mekotio and another banking malware called Grandoreiro as part of a social engineering campaign targeting financial institutions in Europe.

A novel class of vulnerabilities could be leveraged by threat actors to inject visually deceptive malware in a way that's semantically permissible but alters the logic defined by the source code, effectively opening the door to more first-party and supply chain risks.  Dubbed " Trojan Source attacks ," the technique "exploits subtleties in text-encoding standards such as&nbsp; Unicode &nbsp;to produce source code whose tokens are logically encoded in a different order from the one in which they are displayed, leading to vulnerabilities that cannot be perceived directly by human code reviewers," Cambridge University researchers Nicholas Boucher and Ross Anderson said in a newly published paper.   The&nbsp; vulnerabilities &nbsp;— tracked as CVE-2021-42574 and CVE-2021-42694 — affect compilers of all popular programming languages such as C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and Python.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unidentified threat actor has been linked to a new Android malware strain that features the ability to root smartphones and take complete control over infected smartphones while simultaneously taking steps to evade detection.  The malware has been named " AbstractEmu " owing to its use of code abstraction and anti-emulation checks undertaken to thwart analysis right from the moment the apps are opened. Notably, the global mobile campaign is engineered to target and infect as many devices as possible indiscriminately.   Lookout Threat Labs said it found a total of 19 Android applications  that posed as utility apps and system tools like password managers, money managers, app launchers, and data saving apps, seven of which contained the rooting functionality. Only one of the rogue apps, called Lite Launcher, made its way to the official Google Play Store, attracting a total of 10,000 downloads before it was purged.

New Wslink Malware Loader Runs as a Server and Executes Modules in Memory<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/new-wslink-malware-loader-runs-as.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday took the wraps off a "simple yet remarkable" malware loader for malicious Windows binaries targeting Central Europe, North America and the Middle East.  Codenamed " Wslink " by ESET, this previously undocumented malware stands apart from the rest in that it runs as a server and executes received modules in memory. There are no specifics available on the initial compromise vector and there are no code or operational overlaps that tie this tool to a known threat actor group.   The Slovak cybersecurity firm noted that it has seen only a handful of detections in the past two years, suggesting that it could be used in highly-targeted cyber infiltrations.  Wslink is designed to run as a service and can accept encrypted portal executable (PE) files from a specific IP address, which is then decrypted and loaded into memory prior to the execution. To achieve this, the client (i.e., the victim) and the server perform a handshake that in

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors have yet again published two more typosquatted libraries to the official NPM repository that mimic a legitimate package from Roblox, the game company, with the goal of distributing stealing credentials, installing remote access trojans, and infecting the compromised systems with ransomware.  The bogus packages — named " noblox.js-proxy " and " noblox.js-proxies " — were found to impersonate a library called " noblox.js ," a Roblox game API wrapper available on NPM and boasts of nearly 20,000 weekly downloads, with each of the poisoned libraries, downloaded a total of 281 and 106 times respectively.   According to Sonatype researcher Juan Aguirre, who&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;the malicious NPM packages, the author of noblox.js-proxy first published a benign version that was later tampered with the obfuscated text, in reality, a Batch (.bat) script, in the post-installation JavaScript file.

A new spam email campaign has emerged as a conduit for a previously undocumented malware loader that enables the attackers to gain an initial foothold into enterprise networks and drop malicious payloads on compromised systems.  "These infections are also used to facilitate the delivery of additional malware such as Qakbot and Cobalt Strike, two of the most common threats regularly observed targeting organizations around the world,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;researchers with Cisco Talos in a technical write-up.   The malspam campaign is believed to have commenced in mid-September 2021 via laced Microsoft Office documents that, when opened, triggers an infection chain that leads to the machines getting infected with a malware dubbed SQUIRRELWAFFLE .  Mirroring a technique that's consistent with other phishing attacks of this kind, the latest operation leverages stolen email threads to give it a veil of legitimacy and trick unsuspecting users into opening the attachments.

Mozilla on Monday disclosed it blocked two malicious Firefox add-ons installed by 455,000 users that were found misusing the Proxy API to impede downloading updates to the browser.  The two extensions in question, named Bypass and Bypass XM, "interfered with Firefox in a way that prevented users who had installed them from downloading updates, accessing updated blocklists, and updating remotely configured content," Mozilla's Rachel Tublitz and Stuart Colville&nbsp; said .   Because Proxy API can be&nbsp; used &nbsp;to proxy web requests, an abuse of the API could enable a bad actor to control the manner Firefox browser connects to the internet effectively.  In addition to blocking the extensions to prevent installation by other users, Mozilla said it's pausing on approvals for new add-ons that use the proxy API until the fixes are broadly available. What's more, the California-based non-profit said it'd deployed a system add-on named " Proxy Failover " that ships

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly identified rootkit has been found with a valid digital signature issued by Microsoft that's used to proxy traffic to internet addresses of interest to the attackers for over a year targeting online gamers in China.  Bucharest-headquartered cybersecurity technology company Bitdefender named the malware " FiveSys ," calling out its possible credential theft and in-game-purchase hijacking motives. The Windows maker has since revoked the signature following responsible disclosure.   "Digital signatures are a way of establishing trust," Bitdefender researchers said in a white paper, adding "a valid digital signature helps the attacker navigate around the operating system's restrictions on loading third-party modules into the kernel. Once loaded, the rootkit allows its creators to gain virtually unlimited privileges."  Rootkits are both evasive and stealthy as they offer threat actors an entrenched foothold onto victims' systems and conceal

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday took the wraps off a mass volume email attack staged by a prolific cybercriminal gang affecting a wide range of industries, with one of its region-specific operations notably targeting Germany and Austria.  Enterprise security firm Proofpoint  tied the malware campaign with high confidence to&nbsp; TA505 , which is the name assigned to the financially motivated threat group that's been active in the cybercrime business since at least 2014, and is behind the infamous Dridex banking trojan and other arsenals of malicious tools such as FlawedAmmyy, FlawedGrace, Neutrino botnet, and Locky ransomware, among others.  The attacks are said to have started as a series of low-volume email waves, delivering only several thousand messages in each phase, before ramping up in late September and as recently as October 13, resulting in tens to hundreds of thousands of emails.

Ad-Blocking Chrome Extension Caught Injecting Ads in Google Search Pages<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/ad-blocking-chrome-extension-caught.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new deceptive ad injection campaign has been found leveraging an ad blocker extension for Google Chrome and Opera web browsers to sneakily insert ads and affiliate codes on websites, according to new research from cybersecurity firm Imperva.  The findings come following the discovery of rogue domains distributing an ad injection script in late August 2021 that the researchers connected to an add-on called AllBlock. The&nbsp; extension &nbsp;has since been pulled from both the Chrome Web Store and Opera add-ons marketplaces.   While AllBlock is designed to block ads legitimately, the JavaScript code is injected into every new tab opened on the browser. It works by identifying and sending all links in a web page — typically on search engine results pages — to a remote server, which responds back with a list of websites to replace the genuine links with, leading to a scenario where upon clicking a link, the victim is redirected to a different page.

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a new campaign that likely targets entities in Southeast Asia with a previously unrecognized Linux malware that's engineered to enable remote access to its operators, in addition to amassing credentials and function as a proxy server.  The malware family, dubbed " FontOnLake " by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, is said to feature "well-designed modules" that are continuously being upgraded with new features, indicating an active development phase. Samples uploaded to VirusTotal point to the possibility that the very first intrusions utilizing this threat have been happening as early as May 2020.  Avast &nbsp;and&nbsp; Lacework Labs &nbsp;are tracking the same malware under the moniker HCRootkit.

Researchers Discover UEFI Bootkit Targeting Windows Computers Since 2012<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/researchers-discover-uefi-bootkit.html"> Full Text</a>

Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday revealed details of a previously undocumented&nbsp; UEFI &nbsp;(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) bootkit that has been put to use by threat actors to backdoor Windows systems as early as 2012 by modifying a legitimate Windows Boot Manager binary to achieve persistence, once again demonstrating how technology meant to secure the environment prior to loading the operating system is increasingly becoming a "tempting target."  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET codenamed the new malware "ESPecter" for its ability to persist on the EFI System Partition ( ESP ), in addition to circumventing Microsoft Windows Driver Signature Enforcement to load its own unsigned driver that can be used to facilitate espionage activities such as document theft, keylogging, and screen monitoring by periodically capturing screenshots.

The money-making scheme is believed to have been under active development starting from November 2020, with victims reported across Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S.   No fewer than 200 trojan applications were used in the campaign, making it one of the most widespread scams to have been uncovered in 2021. What's more, the malicious apps catered to a varied set of categories ranging from Tools and Entertainment to Personalization, Lifestyle, and Dating, effectively widening the scale of the attacks. One of the apps, Handy Translator Pro, amassed as much as 500,000 downloads.  &amp;qu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Commercially developed FinFisher surveillanceware has been upgraded to infect Windows devices using a&nbsp; UEFI &nbsp;(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) bootkit that leverages a trojanized Windows Boot Manager, marking a shift in infection vectors that allow it to elude discovery and analysis.  Detected in the wild since 2011, FinFisher (aka FinSpy or Wingbird) is a spyware toolset for Windows, macOS, and Linux developed by Anglo-German firm Gamma International and supplied exclusively to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But like with NSO Group's Pegasus, the software has also been used to&nbsp; spy on Bahraini activists &nbsp;in the past allegedly and delivered as part of&nbsp; spear-phishing campaigns &nbsp;in September 2017.   FinFisher is equipped to harvest user credentials, file listings, sensitive documents, record keystrokes, siphon email messages from Thunderbird, Outlook, Apple Mail, and Icedove, intercept Skype contacts, chats, calls and transferred files, and capture audio and video

A new advanced trojan sold on Russian-speaking underground forums comes with capabilities to steal users' accounts on popular online video game distribution services, including Steam, Epic Games Store, and EA Origin, underscoring a growing threat to the lucrative gaming market.  Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which coined the malware " BloodyStealer ," said it first detected the malicious tool in March 2021 as being advertised for sale at an attractive price of 700 RUB (less than $10) for one month or $40 for a lifetime subscription. Attacks using Bloody Stealer have been uncovered so far in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region.   "BloodyStealer is a Trojan-stealer capable of gathering and exfiltrating various types of data, for cookies, passwords, forms, banking cards from browsers, screenshots, log-in memory, and sessions from various applications," the company&nbsp; said .

Microsoft on Monday revealed new malware deployed by the hacking group behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack last December to deliver additional payloads and steal sensitive information from Active Directory Federation Services ( AD FS ) servers.  The tech giant's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) codenamed the "passive and highly targeted backdoor" FoggyWeb, making it the threat actor tracked as Nobelium's latest tool in a long list of cyber weaponry such as&nbsp; Sunburst ,&nbsp; Sunspot ,&nbsp; Raindrop ,&nbsp; Teardrop ,&nbsp; GoldMax, GoldFinder, Sibot ,&nbsp; Flipflop ,&nbsp; NativeZone ,&nbsp; EnvyScout, BoomBox, and VaporRage .   "Once Nobelium obtains credentials and successfully compromises a server, the actor relies on that access to maintain persistence and deepen its infiltration using sophisticated malware and tools," MSTIC researchers&nbsp; said .

The operators behind the BlackRock mobile malware have surfaced back with a new Android banking trojan called&nbsp; ERMAC &nbsp;that targets Poland and has its roots in the infamous Cerberus malware, according to the latest research.  "The new trojan already has active distribution campaigns and is targeting 378 banking and wallet apps with overlays," ThreatFabric's CEO Cengiz Han Sahin said in an emailed statement. First campaigns involving ERMAC are believed to have begun in late August under the guise of the Google Chrome app.  Since then, the attacks have expanded to include a range of apps such as banking, media players, delivery services, government applications, and antivirus solutions like&nbsp; McAfee .   Almost fully based on the notorious banking trojan&nbsp; Cerberus , the Dutch cybersecurity firm's findings come from forum posts made by an actor named DukeEugene last month on August 17, inviting prospective customers to "rent a new android botnet with wide functionalit

Cybersecurity researchers have charted the evolution of Jupyter, a .NET infostealer known for singling out healthcare and education sectors, which make it exceptional at defeating most endpoint security scanning solutions.

The Israeli company said it's currently investigating the scale and scope of the attacks.   First&nbsp; documented &nbsp;in November 2020, Jupyter (aka Solarmarker) is likely Russian in origin and primarily targets Chromium, Firefox, and Chrome browser data, with additional capabilities that allow for full backdoor functionality, including features to siphon information and upload the details to a remote server and download and execute further payloads.

A recently discovered wave of malware attacks has been spotted using a variety of tactics to enslave susceptible machines with easy-to-guess administrative credentials to co-opt them into a network with the goal of illegally mining cryptocurrency.

Numando: A New Banking Trojan Targeting Latin American Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/numando-new-banking-trojan-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly spotted banking trojan has been caught leveraging legitimate platforms like YouTube and Pastebin to store its encrypted, remote configuration and commandeer infected Windows systems, making it the latest to join the&nbsp; long list of malware &nbsp;targeting Latin America (LATAM) after Guildma, Javali, Melcoz, Grandoreiro, Mekotio, Casbaneiro, Amavaldo, Vadokrist, and Janeleiro.  The threat actor behind this malware family — dubbed " Numando " — is believed to have been active since at least 2018.   "[Numando brings] interesting new techniques to the pool of Latin American banking trojans' tricks, like using seemingly useless ZIP archives or bundling payloads with decoy BMP images," ESET researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical analysis published on Friday. "Geographically, it focuses almost exclusively on Brazil with rare campaigns in Mexico and Spain."  Written in Delphi, the malware comes with an array of backdoor capabilities that allow it to control compr

New Malware Targets Windows Subsystem for Linux to Evade Detection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/new-malware-targets-windows-subsystem.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A number of malicious samples have been created for the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with the goal of compromising Windows machines, highlighting a sneaky method that allows the operators to stay under the radar and thwart detection by popular anti-malware engines.  The "distinct tradecraft" marks the first instance where a threat actor has been found abusing WSL to install subsequent payloads.  "These files acted as loaders running a payload that was either embedded within the sample or retrieved from a remote server and was then injected into a running process using Windows API calls," researchers from Lumen Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published on Thursday.   Windows Subsystem for Linux, launched in August 2016, is a&nbsp; compatibility layer &nbsp;that's designed to run Linux binary executables (in ELF format) natively on the Windows platform without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup.   The earliest artifacts date back to M

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Users searching for TeamViewer remote desktop software on search engines like Google are being redirected to malicious links that drop&nbsp; ZLoader &nbsp;malware onto their systems while simultaneously embracing a stealthier infection chain that allows it to linger on infected devices and evade detection by security solutions.  "The malware is downloaded from a Google advertisement published through Google Adwords," researchers from SentinelOne&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published on Monday. "In this campaign, the attackers use an indirect way to compromise victims instead of using the classic approach of compromising the victims directly, such as by phishing."   First discovered in 2016, ZLoader (aka Silent Night and ZBot) is a&nbsp; fully-featured banking trojan &nbsp;and a fork of another banking malware called ZeuS, with newer versions implementing a VNC module that grants adversaries remote access to victim systems.

Researchers on Monday took the wraps off a newly discovered Linux and Windows re-implementation of&nbsp; Cobalt Strike Beacon &nbsp;that's actively set its sights on government, telecommunications, information technology, and financial institutions in the wild.  The as-yet undetected version of the penetration testing tool — codenamed "Vermilion Strike" — marks one of the&nbsp; rare Linux ports , which has been traditionally a Windows-based red team tool heavily repurposed by adversaries to mount an array of targeted attacks. Cobalt Strike bills itself as a " threat emulation software ," with Beacon being the payload engineered to model an advanced actor and duplicate their post-exploitation actions.   "The stealthy sample uses Cobalt Strike's command-and-control (C2) protocol when communicating to the C2 server and has remote access capabilities such as uploading files, running shell commands and writing to files," Intezer researchers said in a report  publishe

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented backdoor that was recently found targeting an unnamed computer retail company based in the U.S. has been linked to a longstanding Chinese espionage operation dubbed Grayfly.  In late August, Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;details of an implant called SideWalk, which is designed to load arbitrary plugins sent from an attacker-controlled server, gather information about running processes in the compromised systems, and transmit the results back to the remote server.  The cybersecurity firm attributed the intrusion to a group it tracks as SparklingGoblin, an adversary believed to be connected to the Winnti (aka APT41) malware family.   But latest research published by researchers from Broadcom's Symantec has pinned the SideWalk backdoor on the China-linked espionage group, pointing out the malware's overlaps with the older Crosswalk malware, with the latest Grayfly hacking activities singling out a number of organizations in Mexico, Taiwan

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details about a new malware family that relies on the Common Log File System ( CLFS ) to hide a second-stage payload in registry transaction files in an attempt to evade detection mechanisms.  FireEye's Mandiant Advanced Practices team, which made the discovery, dubbed the malware PRIVATELOG , and its installer, STASHLOG . Specifics about the identities of the threat actor or their motives remain unclear.  Although the malware is yet to be detected in real-world attacks aimed at customer environments or be spotted launching any second-stage payloads, Mandiant suspects that PRIVATELOG could still be in development, the work of a researcher, or deployed as part of a highly targeted activity.   CLFS is a general-purpose logging subsystem in Windows that's accessible to both kernel-mode as well as user-mode applications such as database systems, OLTP systems, messaging clients, and network event management systems for building and sharing h

New SideWalk Backdoor Targets U.S.-based Computer Retail Business<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/new-sidewalk-backdoor-targets-us-based.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A computer retail company based in the U.S. was the target of a previously undiscovered implant called SideWalk  as part of a recent campaign undertaken by a Chinese advanced persistent threat group primarily known for singling out entities in East and Southeast Asia.  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET attributed the malware to an advanced persistent threat it tracks under the moniker SparklingGoblin, an adversary believed to be connected to the Winnti umbrella group, noting its similarities to another backdoor dubbed&nbsp; Crosswalk &nbsp;that was put to use by the same threat actor in 2019.   "SideWalk is a modular backdoor that can dynamically load additional modules sent from its C&amp;C [command-and-control] server, makes use of Google Docs as a&nbsp; dead drop resolver , and&nbsp; Cloudflare workers &nbsp;as a C&amp;C server," ESET researchers Thibaut Passilly and Mathieu Tartare&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday. "It can also properly handle communication behind a proxy."  Since fir

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A modified version of the WhatsApp messaging app for Android has been trojanized to serve malicious payloads, display full-screen ads, and sign up device owners for unwanted premium subscriptions without their knowledge.  "The Trojan Triada snuck into one of these modified versions of the messenger called FMWhatsApp 16.80.0 together with the advertising software development kit (SDK)," researchers from Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published Tuesday. "This is similar to&nbsp; what happened with APKPure , where the only malicious code that was embedded in the app was a payload downloader."   Modified versions of legitimate Android apps — aka Modding — are designed to perform functions not originally conceived or intended by the app developers, and FMWhatsApp allows users to customize the app with different themes, personalize icons, and hide features like last seen, and even deactivate video calling features.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
ShadowPad, an infamous Windows backdoor that allows attackers to download further malicious modules or steal data, has been put to use by five different Chinese threat clusters since 2017.  "The adoption of ShadowPad significantly reduces the costs of development and maintenance for threat actors," SentinelOne researchers Yi-Jhen Hsieh and Joey Chen&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a detailed overview of the malware, adding "some threat groups stopped developing their own backdoors after they gained access to ShadowPad."  The American cybersecurity firm dubbed ShadowPad a "masterpiece of privately sold malware in Chinese espionage."   A successor to PlugX and a modular malware platform since 2015,&nbsp; ShadowPad &nbsp;catapulted to widespread attention in the wake of supply chain incidents targeting&nbsp; NetSarang ,&nbsp; CCleaner , and&nbsp; ASUS , leading the operators to shift tactics and update their defensive measures with advanced anti-detection and persistence techniques.

NK Hackers Deploy Browser Exploits on South Korean Sites to Spread Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/nk-hackers-deploy-browser-exploit-on.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A North Korean threat actor has been discovered taking advantage of two exploits in Internet Explorer to infect victims with a custom implant as part of a strategic web compromise (SWC) targeting a South Korean online newspaper.  Cybersecurity firm Volexity&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the attacks to a threat actor it tracks as InkySquid, and more widely known by the monikers ScarCruft and APT37. Daily NK, the publication in question, is said to have hosted the malicious code from at least late March 2021 until early June 2021.  The "clever disguise of exploit code amongst legitimate code" and the use of custom malware enables the attackers to avoid detection, Volexity researchers said.   The attacks involved tampering with the jQuery JavaScript libraries hosted on the website to serve additional obfuscated JavaScript code from a remote URL, using it to leverage exploits for two Internet Explorer flaws that were patched by Microsoft in&nbsp; August 2020 &nbsp;and&nbsp; March 2021 .

A new social engineering-based malvertising campaign targeting Japan has been found to deliver a malicious application that deploys a banking trojan on compromised Windows machines to steal credentials associated with cryptocurrency accounts.

New AdLoad Variant Bypasses Apple's Security Defenses to Target macOS Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/new-adload-variant-bypasses-apples.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new wave of attacks involving a notorious macOS adware family has evolved to leverage around 150 unique samples in the wild in 2021 alone, some of which have slipped past Apple's on-device malware scanner and even signed by its own notarization service, highlighting the malicious software ongoing attempts to adapt and evade detection.  "AdLoad," as the malware is known, is one of several widespread adware and bundleware loaders targeting macOS since at least 2017. It's capable of backdooring an affected system to download and install adware or potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), as well as amass and transmit information about victim machines.   The new iteration "continues to impact Mac users who rely solely on Apple's built-in security control XProtect for malware detection," SentinelOne threat researcher Phil Stokes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. "As of today, however, XProtect arguably has around 11 different signatures for AdLoa

A new Android trojan has been found to compromise Facebook accounts of over 10,000 users in at least 144 countries since March 2021 via fraudulent apps distributed through Google Play Store and other third-party app marketplaces.

Although the offending nine applications have since been pulled from Google Play, they continue to be available in third-party app stores, "highlighting the risk of sideloaded applications to mobile endpoints and user data," Zimperium malware researcher Aazim Yaswant said. The list of apps is as follows -   GG Voucher (com.luxcarad.cardid)&nbsp;  Vote European Football (com.gardengu

A systematic analysis of attacks against Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) servers has revealed as many as 14 malware families, 10 of them newly documented, indicating that the Windows-based web server software continues to be a hotbed for&nbsp; natively developed malware &nbsp;for close to eight years.  The findings were presented today by ESET malware researcher Zuzana Hromcova at the&nbsp; Black Hat USA security conference .  "The various kinds of native IIS malware identified are server-side malware and the two things it can do best is, first, see and intercept all communications to the server, and second, affect how the requests are processed," Hromcova told in an interview with The Hacker News. "Their motivations range from cybercrime to espionage, and a technique called SEO fraud."   IIS is an extensible web server software developed by Microsoft, enabling developers to take advantage of its modular architecture and use additional IIS modules to expand on

Healthcare and education sectors are the frequent targets of a new surge in credential harvesting activity from what's a "highly modular" .NET-based information stealer and keylogger, charting the course for the threat actor's continued evolution while simultaneously remaining under the radar.  Dubbed " Solarmarker ," the malware campaign is believed to be active since September 2020, with telemetry data pointing to malicious actions as early as April 2020, according to Cisco Talos. "At its core, the Solarmarker campaign appears to be conducted by a fairly sophisticated actor largely focused on credential and residual information theft," Talos researchers Andrew Windsor and Chris Neal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published last week.   Infections consist of multiple moving parts, chief among them being a .NET assembly module that serves as a system profiler and staging ground on the victim host for command-and-control (C2) communications and fur

Cybersecurity researchers on Friday unmasked new command-and-control (C2) infrastructure belonging to the Russian threat actor tracked as APT29, aka Cozy Bear, that has been spotted actively serving WellMess malware as part of an ongoing attack campaign.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as eight Python packages that were downloaded more than 30,000 times have been removed from the PyPI portal for containing malicious code, once again highlighting how software package repositories are evolving into a popular target for supply chain attacks.  "Lack of moderation and automated security controls in public software repositories allow even inexperienced attackers to use them as a platform to spread malware, whether through typosquatting, dependency confusion, or simple social engineering attacks," JFrog researchers Andrey Polkovnichenko, Omer Kaspi, and Shachar Menashe&nbsp; said &nbsp;Thursday.   PyPI, short for Python Package Index, is the official third-party software repository for Python, with package manager utilities like&nbsp; pip &nbsp;relying on it as the default source for packages and their dependencies.

A cyber attack that derailed websites of Iran's transport ministry and its national railway system earlier this month, causing widespread disruptions in train services, was the result of a never-before-seen reusable wiper malware called "Meteor."  The campaign — dubbed " MeteorExpress " — has not been linked to any previously identified threat group or to additional attacks, making it the first incident involving the deployment of this malware, according to researchers from Iranian antivirus firm&nbsp; Amn Pardaz &nbsp;and SentinelOne. Meteor is believed to have been in the works over the past three years.  "Despite a lack of specific indicators of compromise, we were able to recover most of the attack components," SentinelOne's Principal Threat Researcher, Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, noted.

An Android malware that was observed abusing accessibility services in the device to hijack user credentials from European banking applications has morphed into an entirely new botnet as part of a renewed campaign that began in May 2021.  Italy's CERT-AGID, in late January, disclosed details about&nbsp; Oscorp , a mobile malware developed to attack multiple financial targets with the goal of stealing funds from unsuspecting victims. Its features include the ability to intercept SMS messages and make phone calls and perform Overlay Attacks for more than 150 mobile applications by making use of lookalike login screens to siphon valuable data.   The malware was distributed through malicious SMS messages, with the attacks often conducted in real-time by posing as bank operators to dupe targets over the phone and surreptitiously gain access to the infected device via WebRTC protocol and ultimately conduct unauthorized bank transfers.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are increasingly shifting to "exotic" programming languages such as Go, Rust, Nim, and Dlang that can better circumvent conventional security protections, evade analysis, and hamper reverse engineering efforts.  "Malware authors are known for their ability to adapt and modify their skills and behaviors to take advantage of newer technologies,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Eric Milam, Vice President of threat research at BlackBerry. "That tactic has multiple benefits from the development cycle and inherent lack of coverage from protective products."  On the one hand, languages like Rust are more secure as they offer guarantees like&nbsp; memory-safe programming , but they can also be a double-edged sword when malware engineers abuse the same features designed to offer increased safeguards to their advantage, thereby making malware less susceptible to exploitation and thwart attempts to&nbsp; activate a kill-switch &nbsp;and render them powerless.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An infamous cross-platform crypto-mining malware has continued to refine and improve upon its techniques to strike both Windows and Linux operating systems by setting its sights on older vulnerabilities, while simultaneously latching on to a variety of spreading mechanisms to maximize the effectiveness of its campaigns.  "LemonDuck, an actively updated and robust malware that's primarily known for its botnet and cryptocurrency mining objectives, followed the same trajectory when it adopted more sophisticated behavior and escalated its operations," Microsoft&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published last week. "Today, beyond using resources for its traditional bot and mining activities, LemonDuck steals credentials, removes security controls, spreads via emails, moves laterally, and ultimately drops more tools for human-operated activity."   The malware is notorious for its ability to propagate rapidly across an infected network to facilitate information theft an

A malware known for targeting macOS operating system has been updated once again to add more features to its toolset that allows it to amass and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in a variety of apps, including apps such as Google Chrome and Telegram, as part of further "refinements in its tactics."  XCSSET was&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;in August 2020, when it was found targeting Mac developers using an unusual means of distribution that involved injecting a malicious payload into Xcode IDE projects that's executed at the time of building project files in Xcode.   The malware comes with numerous capabilities, such as reading and dumping Safari cookies, injecting malicious JavaScript code into various websites, stealing information from applications, such as Notes, WeChat, Skype, Telegram, and encrypting user files.  Earlier this April, XCSSET&nbsp; received an upgrade &nbsp;that enabled the malware authors to target macOS 11 Big Sur as well as Macs running on M1 chipset by circumventing new secu

Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday lifted the lid on a previously undocumented malware strain dubbed " MosaicLoader " that singles out individuals searching for cracked software as part of a global campaign.  "The attackers behind MosaicLoader created a piece of malware that can deliver any payload on the system, making it potentially profitable as a delivery service," Bitdefender researchers said in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News. "The malware arrives on target systems by posing as cracked installers. It downloads a malware sprayer that obtains a list of URLs from the C2 server and downloads the payloads from the received links."   The malware has been so named because of its sophisticated internal structure that's orchestrated to prevent reverse-engineering and evade analysis.  Attacks involving MosaicLoader rely on a well-established tactic for malware delivery called search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning, wherein cybercriminals purc

A sweeping probe into a data leak of more than 50,000 phone numbers has revealed an extensive misuse of Israeli company NSO Group's Pegasus "military-grade spyware" to facilitate human rights violations by surveilling heads of state, activists, journalists, and lawyers around the world.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have opened the lid on the continued resurgence of the insidious TrickBot malware , making it clear that the Russia-based transnational cybercrime group is working behind the scenes to revamp its attack infrastructure in response to recent counter efforts from law enforcement.  "The new capabilities discovered are used to monitor and gather intelligence on victims, using a custom communication protocol to hide data transmissions between [command-and-control] servers and victims — making attacks difficult to spot," Bitdefender&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published Monday, suggesting an increase in sophistication of the group's tactics.  "Trickbot shows no sign of slowing down," the researchers noted.   Botnets are formed when hundreds or thousands of hacked devices are enlisted into a network run by criminal operators, which are often then used to launch denial-of-network attacks to pummel businesses and critical infrastructure with

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are warning about a new malware that's striking online gambling companies in China via a watering hole attack to deploy either Cobalt Strike beacons or a previously undocumented Python-based backdoor called BIOPASS RAT  that takes advantage of Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) Studio's live-streaming app to capture the screen of its victims to attackers.  The attack involves deceiving gaming website visitors into downloading a malware loader camouflaged as a legitimate installer for popular-but-deprecated apps such as Adobe Flash Player or Microsoft Silverlight, only for the loader to act as a conduit for fetching next-stage payloads.  Specifically, the websites' online support chat pages are booby-trapped with malicious JavaScript code, which is used to deliver the malware to the victims.   "BIOPASS RAT possesses basic features found in other malware, such as file system assessment, remote desktop access, file exfiltration, and shell command e

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google intervened to remove nine Android apps downloaded more than 5.8 million times from the company's Play Store after the apps were caught furtively stealing users' Facebook login credentials.  "The applications were fully functional, which was supposed to weaken the vigilance of potential victims. With that, to access all of the apps' functions and, allegedly, to disable in-app ads, users were prompted to log into their Facebook accounts," researchers from Dr. Web&nbsp; said . "The advertisements inside some of the apps were indeed present, and this maneuver was intended to further encourage Android device owners to perform the required actions."   The offending apps masked their malicious intent by disguising as photo-editing, rubbish cleaner, fitness, and astrology programs, only to trick victims into logging into their Facebook account and hijack the entered credentials via a piece of JavaScript code received from an adversary-controlled server.

At least 30 different versions of the malware executable have been discovered between Jan. 1, 2018, and Nov. 23, 2020, Czech cybersecurity software company Avast&nbsp; said &nbsp;on Thursday, with a majority of the victims located in the U.S., Brazil, India, Poland, and the Philippines.

Researchers Uncover 'Process Ghosting' — A New Malware Evasion Technique<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/researchers-uncover-process-ghosting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new executable image tampering attack dubbed "Process Ghosting" that could be potentially abused by an attacker to circumvent protections and stealthily run malicious code on a Windows system.  "With this technique, an attacker can write a piece of malware to disk in such a way that it's difficult to scan or delete it — and where it then executes the deleted malware as though it were a regular file on disk," Elastic Security researcher Gabriel Landau&nbsp; said . "This technique does not involve code injection, Process Hollowing, or Transactional NTFS (TxF)."   Process Ghosting expands on previously documented&nbsp; endpoint bypass &nbsp;methods such as&nbsp; Process Doppelgänging &nbsp;and&nbsp; Process Herpaderping , thereby enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade anti-malware defenses and detection.  Process Doppelgänging, analogous to&nbsp; Process Hollowing , involves injecting arbitrary code in the address space of

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have discovered the first known malware, dubbed " Siloscope ," targeting Windows Server containers to infect Kubernetes clusters in cloud environments.  "Siloscape is heavily obfuscated malware targeting Kubernetes clusters through Windows containers,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Unit 42 researcher Daniel Prizmant. "Its main purpose is to open a backdoor into poorly configured Kubernetes clusters in order to run malicious containers such as, but not limited to, cryptojackers."   Siloscape, first detected in March 2021, is characterized by several techniques, including targeting common cloud applications such as web servers to gain an initial foothold via known vulnerabilities, following which it leverages Windows container escape techniques to break out of the confines of the container and gain remote code execution on the underlying node.  A container is an&nbsp; isolated, lightweight silo &nbsp;for running an application on the host operating system. The malware&amp;

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New upgrades have been made to a Python-based "self-replicating, polymorphic bot" called Necro in what's seen as an attempt to improve its chances of infecting vulnerable systems and evading detection.  "Although the bot was originally discovered earlier this year, the latest activity shows numerous changes to the bot, ranging from different command-and-control (C2) communications and the addition of new exploits for spreading, most notably vulnerabilities in VMWare vSphere, SCO OpenServer, Vesta Control Panel and SMB-based exploits that were not present in the earlier iterations of the code," researchers from Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep-dive published today.   Said to be in development as far back as 2015,&nbsp; Necro &nbsp;(aka N3Cr0m0rPh) targets both Linux and Windows devices, with heightened activity observed at the start of the year as part of a malware campaign dubbed " FreakOut " that was found exploiting&nbsp; vulnerabilities &nbsp;in network-attached storage (

Researchers have disclosed significant security weaknesses in popular software applications that could be abused to deactivate their protections and take control of allow-listed applications to perform nefarious operations on behalf of the malware to defeat anti-ransomware defenses.  The twin attacks,&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;by academics from the University of Luxembourg and the University of London, are aimed at circumventing the protected folder feature offered by antivirus programs to encrypt files (aka "Cut-and-Mouse") and disabling their real-time protection by simulating mouse "click" events (aka "Ghost Control").  "Antivirus software providers always offer high levels of security, and they are an essential element in the everyday struggle against criminals,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Prof. Gabriele Lenzini, chief scientist at the Interdisciplinary Center for Security, Reliability, and Trust at the University of Luxembourg.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new backdoor program capable of stealing user login credentials, device information and executing arbitrary commands on Linux systems.

"Facefish consists of 2 parts, Dropper and Rootkit, and its main function is determined by the Rootkit module, which works at the&nbsp; Ring 3 &nbsp;layer and is loaded using the&nbsp; LD_PRELOAD &nbsp;feature to steal user login credentials by hooking ssh/sshd program related functions, and it also supports some backdoor functions," the researchers&nbsp; said .

Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday publicized the disruption of a "clever" malvertising network targeting AnyDesk that delivered a weaponized installer of the remote desktop software via rogue Google ads that appeared in the search engine results pages.  The campaign, which is believed to have begun as early as April 21, 2021, involves a malicious file that masquerades as a setup executable for AnyDesk (AnyDeskSetup.exe), which, upon execution, downloads a PowerShell implant to amass and exfiltrate system information.  "The script had some obfuscation and multiple functions that resembled an implant as well as a hardcoded domain (zoomstatistic[.]com) to 'POST' reconnaissance information such as user name, hostname, operating system, IP address and the current process name," researchers from Crowdstrike&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis.

Researchers on Tuesday disclosed a new espionage campaign that resorts to destructive data-wiping attacks targeting Israeli entities at least since December 2020 that camouflage the malicious activity as ransomware extortions.  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne attributed the attacks to a nation-state actor affiliated with Iran it tracks under the moniker "Agrius."

"The operators behind the attacks intentionally masked their activity as ransomware attacks, an uncommon behavior for financially motivated groups."   The group's modus operandi involves deploying a custom .NET malware called Apostle that has evolved to become fully functional ransomware, supplanting its prior wiper capabilities, while some of the attacks have been carried out using a second

The new wave of attacks, which the company spotted last week, commences with spam emails sent from compromised email accounts with "Outgoing Payments" in the subject line, luring the recipients into opening malicious PDF documents that claim to be remittances, but in reality, connect to a rogue domain to download the STRRAT malware.   Besides establishing connections to a command-and-control server during execution, the malware comes with a range of features that allow it to collect browser passwords, log keystrokes, and run remote command

Experts Warn About Ongoing AutoHotkey-Based Malware Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/experts-warn-about-ongoing-autohotkey.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered an ongoing malware campaign that heavily relies on AutoHotkey (AHK) scripting language to deliver multiple remote access trojans (RAT) such as Revenge RAT, LimeRAT, AsyncRAT, Houdini, and Vjw0rm on target Windows systems.  At least four different versions of the campaign have been spotted starting February 2021, according to researchers from Morphisec Labs.  "The RAT delivery campaign starts from an AutoHotKey (AHK) compiled script," the researchers&nbsp; noted . "This is a standalone executable that contains the following: the AHK interpreter, the AHK script, and any files it has incorporated via the&nbsp; FileInstall &nbsp;command. In this campaign, the attackers incorporate malicious scripts/executables alongside a legitimate application to disguise their intentions."   AutoHotkey is an open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows that's meant to provide easy hotkeys for macro-creation and software automation, enablin

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are abusing Microsoft Build Engine (MSBuild) to filelessly deliver remote access trojans and password-stealing malware on targeted Windows systems.  The actively ongoing campaign is said to have emerged last month, researchers from cybersecurity firm Anomali&nbsp; said &nbsp;on Thursday, adding the malicious build files came embedded with encoded executables and shellcode that deploy&nbsp; backdoors , allowing the adversaries to take control of the victims' machines and steal sensitive information.  MSBuild is an open-source build tool for .NET and Visual Studio developed by Microsoft that allows for compiling source code, packaging, testing, deploying applications.   In using MSBuild to filelessly compromise a machine, the idea is to stay under the radar and thwart detection, as such malware makes use of a legitimate application to load the attack code into memory, thereby leaving no traces of infection on the system and giving attackers a high level of stealth.

Cybersecurity researchers on Monday disclosed a new Android trojan that hijacks users' credentials and SMS messages to facilitate fraudulent activities against banks in Spain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands.  Called " TeaBot " (or Anatsa), the malware is said to be in its early stages of development, with malicious attacks targeting financial apps commencing in late March 2021, followed by a rash of infections in the first week of May against Belgium and Netherlands banks. The first signs of TeaBot activity emerged in January.   "The main goal of TeaBot is stealing victim's credentials and SMS messages for enabling frauds scenarios against a predefined list of banks," Italian cybersecurity, and online fraud prevention firm Cleafy said in a Monday write-up.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor with the capabilities to evolve and tailor its toolset to target environments infiltrated high-profile organizations in Asia and Africa with an evasive Windows rootkit since at least 2018.  Called&nbsp; 'Moriya ,' the malware is a "passive backdoor which allows attackers to inspect all incoming traffic to the infected machine, filter out packets that are marked as designated for the malware and respond to them," said Kaspersky researchers Mark Lechtik and Giampaolo Dedola in a Thursday deep-dive.  The Russian cybersecurity firm termed the ongoing espionage campaign&nbsp; 'TunnelSnake .' Based on telemetry analysis, less than 10 victims around the world have been targeted to date, with the most prominent victims being two large diplomatic entities in Southeast Asia and Africa. All the other victims were located in South Asia.   The first reports of Moriya emerged last November when Kaspersky said it discovered the stealthy implant in the networks

<details>

Researchers on Tuesday disclosed a novel malware that uses a variety of tricks to stay under the radar and evade detection, while stealthily capable of executing arbitrary commands on infected systems.  Called 'Pingback,' the Windows malware leverages Internet Control Message Protocol ( ICMP ) tunneling for covert bot communications, allowing the adversary to utilize ICMP packets to piggyback attack code, according to an analysis  published today by Trustwave.   Pingback (" oci.dll ") achieves this by getting loaded through a legitimate service called&nbsp; MSDTC &nbsp;(Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator) — a component responsible for handling database operations that are distributed over multiple machines — by taking advantage of a method called&nbsp; DLL search order hijacking , which involves using a genuine application to preload a malicious DLL file.

Cybersecurity researchers on Monday disclosed a new malspam campaign distributing a fresh variant of a malware loader called 'Buer' written in Rust, illustrating how adversaries are constantly honing their malware toolsets to evade analysis.  Dubbed "RustyBuer," the malware is distributed via emails masquerading as shipping notices from DHL Support, and is said to have affected no fewer than 200 organizations across more than 50 verticals since early April.  "The new Buer variant is written in Rust, an efficient and easy-to-use programming language that is becoming increasingly popular," Proofpoint researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Rewriting the malware in Rust enables the threat actor to better evade existing Buer detection capabilities."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Linux malware with backdoor capabilities has managed to stay under the radar for about three years, allowing the threat actor behind the operation to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive information from infected systems.  Dubbed " RotaJakiro " by researchers from Qihoo 360 NETLAB, the backdoor targets Linux X64 machines, and is so named after the fact that "the family uses rotate encryption and behaves differently for root/non-root accounts when executing."   The findings come from an analysis of a&nbsp; malware sample &nbsp;it detected on March 25, although early versions appear to have been uploaded to VirusTotal as early as May 2018. A&nbsp; total &nbsp;of&nbsp; four &nbsp; samples &nbsp;have been found to date on the database, all of which remain undetected by most anti-malware engines. As of writing, only seven security vendors flag the latest version of the malware as malicious.   "At the functional level, RotaJakiro first determines whether the user is root or non-

The English-language campaign alone has been observed to make use of more than 700 unique domains, infecting about 7,000 devices in the U.K.  In addition, German and English-language SMS messages were found being sent to U.S. users from Europe, which Proofpoint suspects could be the result of malware propagating via contact lists stored on compromised phones. A concerted campaign aimed at the U.S. is yet to be detected.   FluBot, a nascent entry in the banking trojan landscape, began its operations late last year, with campaigns leveraging the malware infecting more than 60,000 users in Spain, according to an analysis published b

Researchers from the University of Minnesota apologized to the maintainers of Linux Kernel Project on Saturday for intentionally including vulnerabilities in the project's code, which led to the school being banned from contributing to the open-source project in the future.  "While our goal was to improve the security of Linux, we now understand that it was hurtful to the community to make it a subject of our research, and to waste its effort reviewing these patches without its knowledge or permission," assistant professor Kangjie Lu, along with graduate students Qiushi Wu and Aditya Pakki,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an email.  "We did that because we knew we could not ask the maintainers of Linux for permission, or they would be on the lookout for the hypocrite patches," they added.   The apology comes over a study into what's called "hypocrite commits," which was&nbsp; published &nbsp;earlier this February.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Emotet, the notorious email-based Windows malware behind several botnet-driven spam campaigns and ransomware attacks, was automatically wiped from infected computers en masse following a European law enforcement operation.  The development comes three months after a coordinated disruption of Emotet as part of " Operation Ladybird " to seize control of servers used to run and maintain the malware network. The orchestrated effort saw at least 700 servers associated with the botnet's infrastructure neutered from the inside, thus preventing further exploitation.  Law enforcement authorities from the Netherlands, Germany, the U.S., U.K., France, Lithuania, Canada, and Ukraine were involved in the international action.   Previously, the Dutch police, which seized two central servers located in the country, said it had deployed a software update to counter the threat posed by Emotet effectively. "All infected computer systems will automatically retrieve the update there, a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Facebook on Wednesday said it took steps to dismantle malicious activities perpetrated by two state-sponsored hacking groups operating out of Palestine that abused its platform to distribute malware.  The social media giant attributed the attacks to a network connected to the Preventive Security Service ( PSS ), the security apparatus of the State of Palestine, and another threat actor known as Arid Viper (aka Desert Falcon and APT-C-23), the latter of which is alleged to be connected to the cyber arm of Hamas.  The two digital espionage campaigns, active in 2019 and 2020, exploited a range of devices and platforms, such as Android, iOS, and Windows, with the PSS cluster primarily targeting domestic audiences in Palestine. The other set of attacks went after users in the Palestinian territories and Syria and, to a lesser extent Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, and Libya.   Both the groups appear to have leveraged the platform as a springboard to launch a variety of social engineering attacks in

Researchers have uncovered a new set of fraudulent Android apps in the Google Play store that were found to hijack SMS message notifications for carrying out billing fraud.

"Posing as photo editors, wallpapers, puzzles, keyboard skins, and other camera-related apps, the malware embedded in these fraudulent apps hijack SMS message notifications and then make unauthorized purchases," researchers from McAfee said in a Monday write-up.

Malware That Spreads Via Xcode Projects Now Targeting Apple's M1-based Macs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/malware-spreads-via-xcode-projects-now.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Mac malware campaign targeting Xcode developers has been retooled to add support for Apple's new M1 chips and expand its features to steal confidential information from cryptocurrency apps.  XCSSET came into the spotlight in&nbsp; August 2020 &nbsp;after it was found to spread via modified Xcode IDE projects, which, upon the building, were configured to execute the payload. The malware repackages payload modules to imitate legitimate Mac apps, which are ultimately responsible for infecting local Xcode projects and injecting the main payload to execute when the compromised project builds.   XCSSET modules come with the capabilities to steal credentials, capture screenshots, inject malicious JavaScript into websites, plunder user data from different apps, and even encrypt files for a ransom.&nbsp;  Then in March 2021, Kaspersky researchers&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;XCSSET samples compiled for the new Apple M1 chips, suggesting that the malware campaign was not only ongoing but also that adversaries are&nbsp; activ

A malicious program intended to cause havoc with IT systems—malware—is becoming more and more sophisticated every year. The year 2021 is no exception, as recent trends indicate that several&nbsp; new variants of malware &nbsp;are making their way into the world of cybersecurity.  While smarter security solutions are popping up, modern malware still eludes and challenges cybersecurity experts.&nbsp;  The evolution of malware has infected everything from personal computers to industrial units since the 70s. Cybersecurity firm&nbsp; FireEye's network was attacked &nbsp;in 2020 by hackers with the most sophisticated form of hacking i.e., supply chain.  This hacking team demonstrated world-class capabilities to disregard security tools and forensic examination, proving that anybody can be hacked. Also, the year 2021 is already witnessing a bump in&nbsp; COVID-19 vaccine-related phishing attacks .&nbsp;  Let's take a look at the trends that forecast an increase in malware attacks:  COVID-19 and Work-from-Home (WFH)

A previously undocumented malware downloader has been spotted in the wild in phishing attacks to deploy credential stealers and other malicious payloads.

"Saint Bot is a downloader that appeared quite recently, and slowly is getting momentum. It was seen dropping stealers (i.e.&nbsp; Taurus &nbsp;Stealer) or further loaders ( example ), yet its design allows [it] to utilize it for distributing any kind of malware," said Aleksandra "Hasherezade" Doniec, a threat intelligence analyst at Malwarebytes.   "Furthermore, Saint Bot employs a wide variety of techniques which, although not novel, indicate some level of sophistication considering its relatively new appearance."

Gigaset has revealed a malware infection discovered in its Android devices was the result of a compromise of a server belonging to an external update service provider.  Impacting older smartphone models — GS100, GS160, GS170, GS180, GS270 (plus), and GS370 (plus) series — the malware took the form of multiple&nbsp; unwanted apps &nbsp;that were downloaded and installed through a pre-installed system update app.  The infections are said to have occurred starting&nbsp; March 27 .   The German manufacturer of telecommunications devices said it took steps to alert the update service provider of the issue, following which further infections were prevented on April 7.  "Measures have been taken to automatically rid infected devices of the malware. In order for this to happen the devices must be connected to the internet (WLAN, WiFi or mobile data). We also recommend connecting the devices to their chargers. Affected devices should automatically be freed from the malware within 8 hours," the comp

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Iranian threat actor has unleashed a new cyberespionage campaign against a possible Lebanese target with a backdoor capable of exfiltrating sensitive information from compromised systems.  Cybersecurity firm Check Point attributed the operation to APT34, citing similarities with previous techniques used by the threat actor as well as based on its pattern of victimology.  APT34 &nbsp;(aka OilRig) is known for its reconnaissance campaigns aligned with the strategic interests of Iran, primarily hitting financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications industries in the Middle East.   The group typically resorts to targeting individuals through the use of booby-trapped job offer documents, delivered directly to the victims via LinkedIn messages, and the latest campaign is no exception, although the mode of delivery remains unclear as yet.  The Word document analyzed by Check Point — which was&nbsp; uploaded &nbsp;to VirusTotal from Lebanon on January 10 — claims to offer information abo

Besides masquerading as a Netflix app, the malicious "FlixOnline" app also requests intrusive permissions that allow it to create fake Login screens for other apps, with the goal of stealing credentials and gain access to

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what appears to be a fresh twist in Android malware, users of Gigaset mobile devices are encountering unwanted apps that are being downloaded and installed through a pre-installed system update app.  "The culprit installing these malware apps is the Update app, package name&nbsp; com.redstone.ota.ui , which is a pre-installed system app," Malwarebytes researcher Nathan Collier&nbsp; said . "This app is not only the mobile device's system updater, but also an auto installer known as Android/PUP.Riskware.Autoins.Redstone."  The development was&nbsp; first reported &nbsp;by German author and blogger Günter Born last week.   While the issue seems to be mainly affecting Gigaset phones, devices from a handful of other manufacturers appear to be impacted as well. The full list of devices that come with the pre-installed auto-installer includes Gigaset GS270, Gigaset GS160, Siemens GS270, Siemens GS160, Alps P40pro, and Alps S20pro+.  According to Malwarebytes, the Update app installs

Experts uncover a new Banking Trojan targeting Latin American users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/experts-uncover-new-banking-trojan.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers on Tuesday revealed details of a new banking trojan targeting corporate users in Brazil at least since 2019 across various sectors such as engineering, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, finance, transportation, and government.  Dubbed " Janeleiro " by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, the malware aims to disguise its true intent via lookalike pop-up windows that are designed to resemble the websites of some of the biggest banks in the country, including Itaú Unibanco, Santander, Banco do Brasil, Caixa Econômica Federal, and Banco Bradesco.  "These pop-ups contain fake forms, aiming to trick the malware's victims into entering their banking credentials and personal information that the malware captures and exfiltrates to its [command-and-control] servers," ESET researchers Facundo Muñoz and Matías Porolli said in a write-up.   This modus operandi is not new to banking trojans. In August 2020, ESET uncovered a Latin American (LATAM) banking trojan call

Hackers Targeting professionals With 'more_eggs' Malware via LinkedIn Job Offers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/hackers-targeting-professionals-with.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new spear-phishing campaign is targeting professionals on LinkedIn with weaponized job offers in an attempt to infect targets with a sophisticated backdoor trojan called "more_eggs."  To increase the odds of success, the phishing lures take advantage of malicious ZIP archive files that have the same name as that of the victims' job titles taken from their LinkedIn profiles.  "For example, if the LinkedIn member's job is listed as Senior Account Executive—International Freight the malicious zip file would be titled Senior Account Executive—International Freight position (note the 'position' added to the end)," cybersecurity firm eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis. "Upon opening the fake job offer, the victim unwittingly initiates the stealthy installation of the fileless backdoor, more_eggs."   Campaigns delivering more_eggs using the&nbsp; same modus operandi &nbsp;have been spotted at least since 2018, with the backdo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Purple Fox , a Windows malware previously known for infecting machines by using exploit kits and phishing emails, has now added a new technique to its arsenal that gives it worm-like propagation capabilities.  The ongoing campaign makes use of a "novel spreading technique via indiscriminate port scanning and exploitation of exposed SMB services with weak passwords and hashes," according to&nbsp; Guardicore researchers , who say the attacks have spiked by about 600% since May 2020.  A total of 90,000 incidents have been spotted through the rest of 2020 and the beginning of 2021.   First discovered in March 2018,&nbsp;Purple Fox&nbsp;is distributed in the form of malicious ".msi" payloads hosted on nearly 2,000 compromised Windows servers that, in turn, download and execute a component with&nbsp; rootkit capabilities , which enables the threat actors to hide the malware on the machine and make it easy to evade detection.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday disclosed a new attack wherein threat actors are leveraging Xcode as an attack vector to compromise Apple platform developers with a backdoor, adding to a growing trend that involves targeting developers and researchers with malicious attacks.  Dubbed "XcodeSpy," the trojanized Xcode project is a tainted version of a legitimate, open-source project available on GitHub called TabBarInteraction that's used by developers to animate iOS tab bars based on user interaction.  "XcodeSpy is a malicious Xcode project that installs a custom variant of the EggShell backdoor on the developer's macOS computer along with a persistence mechanism," SentinelOne researchers&nbsp; said .   Xcode is Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS, used to develop software for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unwrapped an "interesting email campaign" undertaken by a threat actor that has taken to distributing a new malware written in&nbsp; Nim &nbsp;programming language.  Dubbed " NimzaLoader " by Proofpoint researchers, the development marks one of the rare instances of Nim malware discovered in the threat landscape.  "Malware developers may choose to use a rare programming language to avoid detection, as reverse engineers may not be familiar with Nim's implementation, or focused on developing detection for it, and therefore tools and sandboxes may struggle to analyze samples of it," the researchers said.   Proofpoint is tracking the operators of the campaign under the moniker "TA800," who, they say, started distributing NimzaLoader starting February 3, 2021. Prior to the latest raft of activity, TA800 is known to have predominantly used&nbsp;BazaLoader&nbsp;since April 2020.   While APT28 has been previously linked to delivering&nbsp; Zeb

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday shed light on a new sophisticated backdoor targeting Linux endpoints and servers that's believed to be the work of Chinese nation-state actors.  Dubbed " RedXOR " by Intezer, the backdoor masquerades as a polkit daemon, with similarities found between the malware and those previously associated with the&nbsp; Winnti Umbrella &nbsp;(or Axiom) threat group such as ​PWNLNX, ​XOR.DDOS​ and Groundhog.  RedXOR's name comes from the fact that it encodes its network data with a scheme based on XOR, and that it's compiled with a legacy&nbsp; GCC compiler &nbsp;on an old release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, suggesting that the malware is deployed in targeted attacks against legacy Linux systems.   Intezer said&nbsp; two &nbsp; samples &nbsp;of the malware were uploaded from Indonesia and Taiwan around Feb. 23-24, both countries that are known to be singled out by China-based threat groups.  Aside from the overlaps in terms of the overall flow and functionalities and th

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new malware dropper contained in as many as 9 Android apps distributed via Google Play Store that deploys a second stage malware capable of gaining intrusive access to the financial accounts of victims as well as full control of their devices.  "This dropper, dubbed Clast82, utilizes a series of techniques to avoid detection by Google Play Protect detection, completes the evaluation period successfully, and changes the payload dropped from a non-malicious payload to the AlienBot Banker and MRAT," Check Point researchers Aviran Hazum, Bohdan Melnykov, and Israel Wernik said in a write-up published  today.  The apps that were used for the campaign include Cake VPN, Pacific VPN, eVPN, BeatPlayer, QR/Barcode Scanner MAX, Music Player, tooltipnatorlibrary, and QRecorder. After the findings were reported to Google on January 28, the rogue apps were removed from the Play Store on February 9.&nbsp;   Malware authors have resorted to a variety o

Malware Can Exploit New Flaw in Intel CPUs to Launch Side-Channel Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/malware-can-exploit-new-flaw-in-intel.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new research has yielded yet another means to pilfer sensitive data by exploiting what's the first "on-chip, cross-core" side-channel in Intel Coffee Lake and Skylake processors.  Published by a group of academics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the&nbsp; findings &nbsp;are expected to be presented at the USENIX Security Symposium coming this August.  While information leakage attacks targeting the CPU microarchitecture have been previously demonstrated to break the isolation between user applications and the operating system, allowing a malicious program to access memory used by other programs (e.g., Meltdown and Spectre), the new attack leverages a contention on the ring interconnect.  SoC&nbsp; Ring interconnect &nbsp;is an on-die bus arranged in a ring topology which enables intra-process communication between different components (aka agents) such as the cores, the last level cache (LLC), the graphics unit, and the system agent that are housed inside the CPU.

A framework notorious for delivering a banking Trojan has received a facelift to deploy a wider range of malware, including ransomware payloads.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A credential stealer infamous for targeting Windows systems has resurfaced in a new phishing campaign that aims to steal credentials from Microsoft Outlook, Google Chrome, and instant messenger apps.  Primarily directed against users in Turkey, Latvia, and Italy starting mid-January, the attacks involve the use of&nbsp; MassLogger &nbsp;— a .NET-based malware with capabilities to hinder static analysis — building on similar campaigns undertaken by the same actor against users in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Hungary, Estonia, Romania, and Spain in September, October, and November 2020.  MassLogger was first spotted in the wild last April, but the presence of a new variant implies malware authors are constantly retooling their arsenal to evade detection and monetize them.   "Although operations of the Masslogger trojan have been previously documented, we found the new campaign notable for using the compiled HTML file format to start the infection chain," researchers with Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;on W

First Malware Designed for Apple M1 Chip Discovered in the Wild<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/first-malware-designed-for-apple-m1.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
One of the first malware samples tailored to run natively on Apple's M1 chips has been discovered, suggesting a new development that indicates that bad actors have begun adapting malicious software to target the company's latest generation of Macs powered by its own processors.  While the transition to Apple silicon has necessitated developers to build new versions of their apps to ensure better performance and compatibility, malware authors are now undertaking similar steps to build malware that are capable of executing natively on Apple's new M1 systems, according to macOS Security researcher Patrick Wardle.  Wardle detailed a Safari adware extension called GoSearch22 that was originally written to run on Intel x86 chips but has since been ported to run on ARM-based M1 chips. The rogue extension, which is a variant of the Pirrit advertising malware, was first seen in the wild on November 23, 2020, according to a sample&nbsp; uploaded &nbsp;to VirusTotal on December 27.

A previously known Windows remote access Trojan (RAT) with credential-stealing capabilities has now expanded its scope to set its sights on users of Android devices to further the attacker's espionage motives.  "The developers of&nbsp; LodaRAT &nbsp;have added Android as a targeted platform," Cisco Talos researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. "A new iteration of LodaRAT for Windows has been identified with improved sound recording capabilities."  Kasablanca, the group behind the malware, is said to have deployed the new RAT in an ongoing hybrid campaign targeting Bangladeshi users, the researchers noted.  The reason why Bangladesh-based organizations have been specifically singled out for this campaign remains unclear, as is the identity of the threat actor.   First documented in May 2017 by&nbsp; Proofpoint , Loda is an AutoIt malware typically delivered via phishing lures that's equipped to run a wide range of commands designed to record audio, video, and capture oth

"This extension contains malware,"&nbsp; read &nbsp;a terse notification from Google, but it has since emerged that the add-on stealthily added features that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code from a remote server, including tracking users online and committing advertising fraud.  "The old maintainer appears to have sold the extension to parties unknown, who have malicious intent to exploit the users of this extension in advertising fraud, tracking, and more," Calum McConnell&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a GitHub post.

High-performance computing clusters belonging to university networks as well as servers associated with government agencies, endpoint security vendors, and internet service providers have been targeted by a newly discovered backdoor that gives attackers the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the systems remotely.  Cybersecurity firm ESET named the malware " Kobalos " — a nod to a " mischievous creature " of the same name from Greek mythology — for its "tiny code size and many tricks."  "Kobalos is a generic backdoor in the sense that it contains broad commands that don't reveal the intent of the attackers," researchers Marc-Etienne M. Léveillé and Ignacio Sanmillan&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. "In short, Kobalos grants remote access to the file system, provides the ability to spawn terminal sessions, and allows proxying connections to other Kobalos-infected servers."   Besides tracing the malware back to attacks against a nu

Agent Tesla Malware Spotted Using New Delivery &amp; Evasion Techniques<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/agent-tesla-malware-spotted-using-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers on Tuesday uncovered new delivery and evasion techniques adopted by Agent Tesla remote access trojan (RAT) to get around defense barriers and monitor its victims.  Typically spread through&nbsp;social engineering&nbsp;lures, the Windows spyware not only now targets Microsoft's Antimalware Scan Interface ( AMSI ) in an attempt to defeat endpoint protection software, it also employs a multi-stage installation process and makes use of Tor and Telegram messaging API to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server.  Cybersecurity firm Sophos , which observed two versions of Agent Tesla — version 2 and version 3 — currently in the wild, said the changes are yet another sign of Agent Tesla's constant evolution designed to make a sandbox and static analysis more difficult.   "The differences we see between v2 and v3 of Agent Tesla appear to be focused on improving the success rate of the malware against sandbox defenses and malware scanners, and on providing more

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers today disclosed a new supply chain attack compromising the update mechanism of NoxPlayer, a free Android emulator for PCs and Macs.  Dubbed " Operation NightScout " by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, the highly-targeted surveillance campaign involved distributing three different malware families via tailored malicious updates to selected victims based in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka.  NoxPlayer, developed by Hong Kong-based BigNox, is an Android emulator that allows users to play mobile games on PC, with support for keyboard, gamepad, script recording, and multiple instances. It is&nbsp; estimated &nbsp;to have over 150 million users in more than 150 countries.   First signs of the ongoing attack are said to have originated around September 2020, from when the compromise continued until "explicitly malicious activity" was uncovered this week, prompting ESET to report the incident to BigNox.

A financially-motivated threat actor notorious for its cryptojacking attacks has leveraged a revised version of their malware to target cloud infrastructures using vulnerabilities in web server technologies, according to new research.  Deployed by the China-based cybercrime group&nbsp; Rocke , the Pro-Ocean cryptojacking malware now comes with improved rootkit and worm capabilities, as well as harbors new evasion tactics to sidestep cybersecurity companies' detection methods, Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday write-up.   "Pro-Ocean uses known vulnerabilities to target cloud applications," the researchers detailed. "In our analysis, we found Pro-Ocean targeting Apache ActiveMQ ( CVE-2016-3088 ), Oracle WebLogic ( CVE-2017-10271 ) and Redis (unsecure instances)."  "Once installed, the malware kills any process that uses the CPU heavily, so that it's able to use 100% of the CPU and mine Monero efficiently."  First documented

Beware — A New Wormable Android Malware Spreading Through WhatsApp<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/beware-new-wormable-android-malware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly discovered Android malware has been found to propagate itself through WhatsApp messages to other contacts in order to expand what appears to be an adware campaign.  "This malware spreads via victim's WhatsApp by automatically replying to any received WhatsApp message notification with a link to [a] malicious Huawei Mobile app," ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko  said.  The link to the fake Huawei Mobile app, upon clicking, redirects users to a lookalike Google Play Store website.  Once installed, the wormable app prompts victims to grant it notification access, which is then abused to carry out the wormable attack.   Specifically, it leverages WhatApp's quick reply feature — which is used to respond to incoming messages directly from the notifications — to send out a reply to a received message automatically.  Besides requesting permissions to read notifications, the app also requests intrusive access to run in the background as well as to draw over other apps,

MrbMiner Crypto-Mining Malware Links to Iranian Software Company<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/mrbminer-crypto-mining-malware-links-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A relatively new crypto-mining malware that surfaced last year and infected thousands of Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) databases has now been linked to a small software development company based in Iran.  The attribution was made possible due to an operational security oversight, said researchers from cybersecurity firm Sophos, that led to the company's name inadvertently making its way into the cryptominer code.  First documented by Chinese tech giant Tencent last September,&nbsp; MrbMiner &nbsp;was found to target internet-facing MSSQL servers with the goal of installing a cryptominer, which hijacks the processing power of the systems to mine Monero and funnel them into accounts controlled by the attackers.  The name "MrbMiner" comes after one of the domains used by the group to host their malicious mining software.   "In many ways, MrbMiner's operations appear typical of most cryptominer attacks we've seen targeting internet-facing servers,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Gabor Szappa

Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a fourth new malware strain—designed to spread the malware onto other computers in victims' networks—which was deployed as part of the&nbsp; SolarWinds supply chain attack &nbsp;disclosed late last year.  Dubbed "Raindrop" by Broadcom-owned Symantec, the malware joins the likes of other malicious implants such as&nbsp; Sunspot , Sunburst (or Solorigate), and Teardrop that were stealthily delivered to enterprise networks.   The latest finding comes amid a continued probe into the breach, suspected to be of&nbsp; Russian origin , that has claimed a number of U.S. government agencies and private sector companies.  "The discovery of Raindrop is a significant step in our investigation of the SolarWinds attacks as it provides further insights into post-compromise activity at organizations of interest to the attackers," Symantec researchers&nbsp; said .

An ongoing malware campaign has been found exploiting recently disclosed vulnerabilities in Linux devices to co-opt the systems into an&nbsp; IRC botnet &nbsp;for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and mining Monero cryptocurrency.  The attacks involve a new malware variant called " FreakOut " that leverages newly patched flaws in TerraMaster, Laminas Project (formerly Zend Framework), and Liferay Portal, according to Check Point Research's new analysis published  today and shared with The Hacker News.   Attributing the malware to be the work of a long-time cybercrime hacker — who goes by the aliases Fl0urite and Freak on HackForums and Pastebin as early as 2015 — the researchers said the flaws —&nbsp; CVE-2020-28188 ,&nbsp; CVE-2021-3007 , and&nbsp; CVE-2020-7961 &nbsp;— were weaponized to inject and execute malicious commands in the server.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a series of attacks by a threat actor of Chinese origin that has targeted organizations in Russia and Hong Kong with malware — including a previously undocumented backdoor.  Attributing the campaign to&nbsp; Winnti &nbsp;(or APT41), Positive Technologies dated the first attack to May 12, 2020, when the APT used LNK shortcuts to extract and run the malware payload. A second attack detected on May 30 used a malicious RAR archive file consisting of shortcuts to two bait PDF documents claimed to be a curriculum vitae and an IELTS certificate.   The shortcuts themselves contain links to pages hosted on Zeplin, a legitimate collaboration tool for designers and developers that are used to fetch the final-stage malware that, in turn, includes a shellcode loader ("svchast.exe") and a backdoor called&nbsp; Crosswalk &nbsp;("3t54dE3r.tmp").  Crosswalk, first documented by FireEye in 2017, is a bare-bones modular backdoor capable of carrying out system r

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers took the wraps off an ongoing surveillance campaign directed against Colombian government institutions and private companies in the energy and metallurgical industries.  In a report published by ESET on Tuesday, the Slovak internet security company said the attacks — dubbed " Operation Spalax " — began in 2020, with the modus operandi sharing some similarities to an APT group targeting the country since at least April 2018, but also different in other ways.  The overlaps come in the form of phishing emails, which have similar topics and pretend to come from some of the same entities that were used in a February 2019 operation disclosed by&nbsp; QiAnXin researchers , and subdomain names used for command-and-control (C2) servers.   However, the two campaigns diverge in the attachments used for phishing emails, the remote access trojans (RATs) deployed, and the C2 infrastructure employed to fetch the malware dropped.  The attack chain begins with the target

Cybersecurity researchers have exposed the operations of an Android malware vendor who teamed up with a second threat actor to market and sell a remote access Trojan (RAT) capable of device takeover and exfiltration of photos, locations, contacts, and messages from popular apps such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Skype, Telegram, Kik, Line, and Google Messages.  The vendor, who goes by the name of " Triangulum " in a number of darknet forums, is alleged to be a 25-year-old man of Indian origin, with the individual opening up shop to sell the malware three years ago on June 10, 2017, according to an analysis published by Check Point  Research today.  "The product was a mobile RAT, targeting Android devices and capable of exfiltration of sensitive data from a C&amp;C server, destroying local data – even deleting the entire OS, at times," the researchers said.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the investigation into the SolarWinds supply-chain attack continues, cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a third malware strain that was deployed into the build environment to inject the backdoor into the company's Orion network monitoring platform.  Called " Sunspot ," the backdoor adds to a growing list of previously disclosed malicious software such as Sunburst and Teardrop.  "This highly sophisticated and novel code was designed to inject the Sunburst malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion Platform without arousing the suspicion of our software development and build teams," SolarWinds' new CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna&nbsp; explained .   While&nbsp; preliminary evidence &nbsp;found that operators behind the espionage campaign managed to compromise the software build and code signing infrastructure of SolarWinds Orion platform as early as October 2019 to deliver the Sunburst backdoor, the latest findings reveal a new timeline that establishes the first breach of

Cybersecurity researchers, for the first time, may have found a potential connection between the backdoor used in&nbsp; the SolarWinds hack &nbsp;to a previously known malware strain.  In new&nbsp; research &nbsp;published by Kaspersky researchers today, the cybersecurity firm said it discovered several features that overlap with another backdoor known as&nbsp; Kazuar , a .NET-based malware first documented by Palo Alto Networks in 2017.  Disclosed early last month, the&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;was notable for its scale and stealth, with the attackers leveraging the trust associated with SolarWinds Orion software to infiltrate government agencies and other companies so as to deploy a custom malware codenamed "Sunburst."  Shared Features Between Sunburst and Kazuar  Attribution for the SolarWinds supply-chain compromise has been difficult in part due to little-to-no clues linking the attack infrastructure to previous campaigns or other well-known threat groups.

Cybesecurity researchers today revealed  a new malspam campaign that distributes a remote access Trojan (RAT) by purporting to contain a sex scandal video of U.S. President Donald Trump.  The emails, which carry with the subject line "GOOD LOAN OFFER!!," come attached with a Java archive (JAR) file called "TRUMP_SEX_SCANDAL_VIDEO.jar," which, when downloaded, installs Qua or Quaverse RAT ( QRAT ) onto the infiltrated system.  "We suspect that the bad guys are attempting to ride the frenzy brought about by the recently concluded Presidential elections since the filename they used on the attachment is totally unrelated to the email's theme," Trustwave's Senior Security Researcher Diana Lopera said in a write-up published today.   The latest campaign is a variant of the Windows-based QRAT downloader Trustwave researchers&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;in August.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers today revealed a wide-ranging scam targeting cryptocurrency users that began as early as January last year to distribute trojanized applications to install a previously undetected remote access tool on target systems.  Called ElectroRAT  by Intezer, the RAT is written from ground-up in Golang and designed to target multiple operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.&nbsp;  The apps are developed using the open-source Electron cross-platform desktop app framework.  "ElectroRAT is the latest example of attackers using Golang to develop multi-platform malware and evade most antivirus engines," the researchers said .   "It is common to see various information stealers trying to collect private keys to access victims wallets. However, it is rare to see tools written from scratch and targeting multiple operating systems for these purposes."  The campaign, first detected in December, is believed to have claimed over 6,500 victims based on th

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors have been discovered distributing a new credential stealer written in AutoHotkey (AHK) scripting language as part of an ongoing campaign that started early 2020.  Customers of financial institutions in the US and Canada are among the primary targets for credential exfiltration, with a specific focus on banks such as Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Canada, HSBC, Alterna Bank, Capital One, Manulife, and EQ Bank. Also included in the list is an Indian banking firm ICICI Bank.  AutoHotkey &nbsp;is an open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows aimed at providing easy hotkeys for macro-creation and software automation that allows users to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows application.   The multi-stage infection chain commences with a malware-laced Excel file that's embedded with a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)&nbsp; AutoOpen &nbsp;macro, which is subsequently used to drop and execute the downloader client script ("adb.ahk") via a legitimate portable AHK

The information security news cycle went into overdrive yesterday afternoon. First, Reuters revealed that the Commerce and Treasury departments suffered significant intrusions. The Washington Post soon followed up with multiple sources attributing the attack to the Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVR—in particular, a portion of the SVR known as Cozy Bear—although there is no official attribution yet. Within a few hours, FireEye and Microsoft announced that this was a “supply chain attack” involving SolarWinds Orion software, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an emergency directive. Today, it turns out that the attackers also compromised the Department of Homeland Security. SolarWinds revealed to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the breach may affect 18,000 customers.
