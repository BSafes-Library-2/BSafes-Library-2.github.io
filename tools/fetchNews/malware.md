Emotet Malware Makes a Comeback with New Evasion Techniques<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/emotet-malware-makes-comeback-with-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Emotet malware operation has continued to refine its tactics in an effort to fly under the radar, while also acting as a conduit for other dangerous malware such as Bumblebee and IcedID. Emotet, which officially&nbsp; reemerged &nbsp;in late 2021 following a coordinated takedown of its infrastructure by authorities earlier that year, has continued to be a persistent threat that's distributed via phishing emails. Attributed to a cybercrime group tracked as&nbsp; TA542 &nbsp;(aka Gold Crestwood or Mummy Spider), the virus has&nbsp; evolved &nbsp;from a banking trojan to a malware distributor since its first appearance in 2014. The malware-as-a-service (MaaS) is also modular, capable of deploying an array of proprietary and freeware components that can exfiltrate sensitive information from compromised machines and carry out other post-exploitation activities. Two latest additions to Emotet's module arsenal comprise an&nbsp; SMB spreader &nbsp;that's designed to facilitate lateral movement using a list of h

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors associated with the Roaming Mantis attack campaign have been observed delivering an updated variant of their patent mobile malware known as Wroba to infiltrate Wi-Fi routers and undertake Domain Name System ( DNS ) hijacking. Kaspersky, which carried out an&nbsp; analysis &nbsp;of the malicious artifact, said the feature is designed to target specific Wi-Fi routers located in South Korea. Roaming Mantis, also known as Shaoye, is a long-running financially motivated operation that singles out Android smartphone users with malware capable of stealing bank account credentials as well as harvesting other kinds of sensitive information. Although primarily&nbsp; targeting the Asian region &nbsp;since 2018, the hacking crew was detected&nbsp; expanding &nbsp;its&nbsp; victim range &nbsp;to include France and Germany for the first time in early 2022 by camouflaging the malware as the Google Chrome web browser application.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor behind the&nbsp; BlackRock &nbsp;and&nbsp; ERMAC &nbsp;Android banking trojans has unleashed yet another malware for rent called&nbsp; Hook &nbsp;that introduces new capabilities to access files stored in the devices and create a remote interactive session. ThreatFabric, in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News, characterized Hook as a novel ERMAC fork that's advertised for sale for $7,000 per month while featuring "all the capabilities of its predecessor." "In addition, it also adds to its arsenal Remote Access Tooling (RAT) capabilities, joining the ranks of families such as&nbsp; Octo &nbsp;and&nbsp; Hydra , which are capable performing a full Device Take Over (DTO), and complete a full fraud chain, from PII exfiltration to transaction, with all the intermediate steps, without the need of additional channels," the Dutch cybersecurity firm said.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing campaign dubbed&nbsp; Earth Bogle &nbsp;is leveraging geopolitical-themed lures to deliver the NjRAT remote access trojan to victims across the Middle East and North Africa. "The threat actor uses public cloud storage services such as files[.]fm and failiem[.]lv to host malware, while compromised web servers distribute NjRAT," Trend Micro&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Wednesday. Phishing emails, typically tailored to the victim's interests, are loaded with malicious attachments to activate the infection routine. This takes the form of a Microsoft Cabinet (CAB) archive file containing a Visual Basic Script dropper to deploy the next-stage payload. Alternatively, it's suspected that the files are distributed via social media platforms such as Facebook and Discord, in some cases even creating bogus accounts to serve ads on pages impersonating legitimate news outlets. The CAB files, hosted on cloud storage services, also masquerade as sensitive voice calls to entice

Users of Zoho ManageEngine are being urged to patch their instances against a critical security vulnerability ahead of the release of a proof-of-concept ( PoC ) exploit code. The issue in question is&nbsp; CVE-2022-47966 , an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability affecting several products due to the use of an outdated third-party dependency, Apache Santuario. "This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated adversary to execute arbitrary code," Zoho&nbsp; warned &nbsp;in an advisory issued late last year, noting that it affects all ManageEngine setups that have the SAML single sign-on (SSO) feature enabled, or had it enabled in the past. Horizon3.ai has now released Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) associated with the flaw, stating that it was able to successfully reproduce the exploit against ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus and ManageEngine Endpoint Central products.

A threat actor by the name&nbsp; Lolip0p &nbsp;has uploaded three rogue packages to the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that are designed to drop malware on compromised developer systems. The packages – named&nbsp; colorslib &nbsp;(versions 4.6.11 and 4.6.12),&nbsp; httpslib &nbsp;(versions 4.6.9 and 4.6.11), and&nbsp; libhttps &nbsp;(version 4.6.12) – by the author between January 7, 2023, and January 12, 2023.

The modules come with identical setup scripts that are designed to invoke PowerShell and run a malicious binary (" Oxzy.exe ") hosted on Dropbox, Fortinet&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a report published last week. The executable, once launched, triggers the retrieval of a next-stage, also a binary named&nbsp; update.exe , that runs in the Windows temporary folder ("%USER%\AppData\Local\Temp\"). update.exe is flagged by antivirus vendors on VirusTotal as an information stealer that's also capable of

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A "large and resilient infrastructure" comprising over 250 domains is being used to distribute information-stealing malware such as&nbsp; Raccoon &nbsp;and&nbsp; Vidar &nbsp;since early 2020. The infection chain "uses about a hundred of fake cracked software catalogue websites that redirect to several links before downloading the payload hosted on file share platforms, such as GitHub," cybersecurity firm SEKOIA&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published earlier this month. The French cybersecurity company assessed the domains to be operated by a threat actor running a traffic direction system ( TDS ), which allows other cybercriminals to rent the service to distribute their malware. The attacks target users searching for cracked versions of software and games on search engines like Google, surfacing fraudulent websites on top by leveraging a technique called search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning to lure victims into downloading and executing the malicious payloads.

A new analysis of Raspberry Robin's attack infrastructure has&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that it's possible for other threat actors to repurpose the infections for their own malicious activities, making it an even more potent threat. Raspberry Robin (aka QNAP worm), attributed to a threat actor dubbed DEV-0856, is malware that has&nbsp; increasingly &nbsp; come under the radar &nbsp;for being used in attacks aimed at finance, government, insurance, and telecom entities. Given its use multiple threat actors to drop a wide range of payloads such as SocGholish , Bumblebee ,&nbsp; TrueBot ,&nbsp; IcedID , and&nbsp; LockBit &nbsp;ransomware, it's suspected to be a pay-per-install (PPI) botnet capable of serving next-stage payloads. Raspberry Robin, notably, employs infected USB drives as a propagation mechanism and leverages breached QNAP network-attached storage (NAS) devices as first-level command-and-control (C2).

In yet another campaign targeting the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository, six malicious packages have been found deploying information stealers on developer systems. The now-removed packages, which were&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;by Phylum between December 22 and December 31, 2022, include pyrologin, easytimestamp, discorder, discord-dev, style.py, and pythonstyles. The malicious code, as is&nbsp; increasingly the case , is concealed in the setup script (setup.py) of these libraries, meaning running a "pip install" command is enough to activate the malware deployment process. The malware is designed to launch a PowerShell script that retrieves a ZIP archive file, install invasive dependencies such as pynput, pydirectinput, and pyscreenshot, and run a Visual Basic Script extracted from the archive to execute more PowerShell code.

Dridex Malware Now Attacking macOS Systems with Novel Infection Method<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/dridex-malware-now-attacking-macos.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A variant of the infamous Dridex banking malware has set its sights on Apple's macOS operating system using a previously undocumented infection method, according to latest research. It has "adopted a new technique to deliver documents embedded with malicious macros to users without having to pretend to be invoices or other business-related files," Trend Micro researcher Armando Nathaniel Pedragoza&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report. Dridex , also called Bugat and Cridex, is an information stealer that's known to harvest sensitive data from infected machines and deliver and execute malicious modules. It's attributed to an e-crime group known as Evil Corp (aka Indrik Spider). The malware is also considered to be a successor of&nbsp; Gameover Zeus , itself a follow-up to another banking trojan called Zeus. Previous Dridex campaigns targeting Windows have&nbsp; leveraged &nbsp;macro-enabled Microsoft Excel documents sent via phishing emails to deploy the payload. Trend Micro's a

SpyNote Strikes Again: Android Spyware Targeting Financial Institutions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/spynote-strikes-again-android-spyware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Financial institutions are being targeted by a new version of Android malware called&nbsp; SpyNote &nbsp;at least since October 2022. "The reason behind this increase is that the developer of the spyware, who was previously selling it to other actors, made the source code public," ThreatFabric&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This has helped other actors [in] developing and distributing the spyware, often also targeting banking institutions." Some of the notable institutions that are impersonated by the malware include Deutsche Bank, HSBC U.K., Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Nubank. SpyNote (aka SpyMax) is feature-rich and comes with a plethora of capabilities that allow it to install arbitrary apps; gather SMS messages, calls, videos, and audio recordings; track GPS locations; and even hinder efforts to uninstall the app. It also follows the modus operandi of other&nbsp; banking &nbsp; malware &nbsp;by requesting for permissions to accessibility services to extract two-facto

The Evolving Tactics of Vidar Stealer: From Phishing Emails to Social Media<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/the-evolving-tactics-of-vidar-stealer.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious information-stealer known as&nbsp; Vidar &nbsp;is continuing to leverage popular social media services such as TikTok, Telegram, Steam, and Mastodon as an intermediate command-and-control (C2) server. "When a user creates an account on an online platform, a unique account page that can be accessed by anyone is generated," AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC) disclosed in a technical analysis&nbsp; published &nbsp;late last month. "Threat actors write identifying characters and the C2 address in parts of this page." In other words, the technique relies on actor-controlled throwaway accounts created on social media to retrieve the C2 address. An advantage to this approach is that should the C2 server be taken down or blocked, the adversary can trivially get around the restrictions by setting up a new server and editing the account pages to allow the previously distributed malware to communicate with the server. Vidar, first identified in 2018, is a&nbsp; commer

New shc-based Linux Malware Targeting Systems with Cryptocurrency Miner<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/new-shc-based-linux-malware-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Linux malware developed using the shell script compiler ( shc ) has been observed deploying a cryptocurrency miner on compromised systems. "It is presumed that after successful authentication through a dictionary attack on inadequately managed Linux SSH servers, various malware were installed on the target system," AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today. shc allows shell scripts to be converted directly into binaries, offering protections against unauthorized source code modifications. It's analogous to the&nbsp; BAT2EXE utility &nbsp;in Windows that's used to convert any batch file to an executable. In an attack chain detailed by the South Korean cybersecurity firm, a successful compromise of the SSH server leads to the deployment of an shc downloader malware along with a Perl-based DDoS IRC Bot. The shc downloader subsequently proceeds to fetch the XMRig miner software to mine cryptocurrency, with the IRC bot capable o

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Financial and insurance sectors in Europe have been targeted by the Raspberry Robin worm, as the malware continues to evolve its post-exploitation capabilities while remaining under the radar. "What is unique about the malware is that it is heavily obfuscated and highly complex to statically disassemble," Security Joes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published Monday. The intrusions, observed against Spanish and Portuguese-speaking organizations, are notable for collecting more victim machine data than previously documented, with the malware now exhibiting sophisticated techniques to resist analysis. Raspberry Robin, also called QNAP worm, is&nbsp; being used &nbsp;by several threat actors as a means to gain a foothold into target networks. Spread via infected USB drives and other methods, the framework has been recently put to use in attacks aimed at telecom and government sectors. Microsoft is tracking the operators of Raspberry Robin under the moniker&nbsp; DEV-0856 . Security Joes' f

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WordPress sites are being targeted by a previously unknown strain of Linux malware that exploits flaws in over two dozen plugins and themes to compromise vulnerable systems. "If sites use outdated versions of such add-ons, lacking crucial fixes, the targeted web pages are injected with malicious JavaScripts," Russian security vendor Doctor Web&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "As a result, when users click on any area of an attacked page, they are redirected to other sites." The attacks involve weaponizing a list of known security vulnerabilities in 19 different plugins and themes that are likely installed on a WordPress site, using it to deploy an implant that can target a specific website to further expand the network. It's also capable of injecting JavaScript code retrieved from a remote server in order to redirect the site visitors to an arbitrary website of the attacker's choice.

More than 300,000 users across 71 countries have been victimized by a new Android threat campaign called the&nbsp; Schoolyard Bully Trojan .  Mainly designed to steal Facebook credentials, the malware is camouflaged as legitimate education-themed applications to lure unsuspecting users into downloading them.  The apps, which were available for download from the official Google Play Store, have now been taken down. That said, they still continue to be available on third-party app stores.   "This trojan uses JavaScript injection to steal the Facebook credentials," Zimperium researchers Nipun Gupta and Aazim Bill SE Yaswant said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.  It achieves this by launching Facebook's login page in a WebView, which also embeds within it malicious JavasCript code to exfiltrate the user's phone number, email address, and password to a configured command-and-control (C2) server.

A malicious Android SMS application discovered on the Google Play Store has been found to stealthily harvest text messages with the goal of creating accounts on a wide range of platforms like Facebook, Google, and WhatsApp.  The app, named&nbsp; Symoo &nbsp;(com.vanjan.sms), had over 100,000 downloads and functioned as a relay for transmitting messages to a server, which advertises an account creation service.  This is achieved by using the phone numbers associated with the infected devices as a means to gather the one-time password that's typically sent to verify the user when setting up new accounts.   "The malware asks the phone number of the user in the first screen," security researcher Maxime Ingrao, who discovered the malware,&nbsp; said , while also requesting for SMS permissions.  "Then it pretends to load the application but remains all the time on this page, it is to hide the interface of the received SMS and that the user does not see the SMS of subscriptions to the va

This Android File Manager App Infected Thousands of Devices with SharkBot Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/this-android-file-manager-app-infected.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Android banking fraud malware known as SharkBot  has reared its head once again on the official Google Play Store, posing as file managers to bypass the app marketplace's restrictions.  A majority of the users who downloaded the rogue apps are located in the U.K. and Italy, Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published this week.  SharkBot, first&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;towards the end of 2021 by Cleafy, is a&nbsp; recurring &nbsp; mobile &nbsp; threat &nbsp;distributed both on the Google Play Store and other third-party app stores.   One of the trojan's primary goals is to initiate money transfers from compromised devices via a technique called "Automatic Transfer System" ( ATS ), in which a transaction triggered via a banking app is intercepted to swap the payee account with an actor-controlled account in the background.  It's also capable of serving a fake login overlay when users attempt to open legitimate banking apps, stealing the credentials in the proce

"The operation ultimately hijacks Facebook Business accounts to which the victim has sufficient access. The threat actor uses their gained access to run ads for monetary gain."   Attributed to a Vietnamese threat actor, the Ducktail campaign is designed to target businesses in the digital marketing and advertising sectors which are active on the Facebook Ads and Business platform.

A nascent and legitimate penetration testing framework known as Nighthawk is likely to gain threat actors' attention for its Cobalt Strike-like capabilities.  Enterprise security firm Proofpoint said it detected the use of the software in mid-September 2022 with a number of test emails sent using generic subject lines such as "Just checking in" and "Hope this works2."  However, there are no indications that a leaked or cracked version of Nighthawk is being weaponized by threat actors in the wild, Proofpoint researcher Alexander Rausch&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up.   Nighthawk, launched in December 2021 by a company called MDSec, is analogous to its counterparts&nbsp; Cobalt Strike ,&nbsp; Sliver , and&nbsp; Brute Ratel , offering a red team toolset for adversary threat simulation. It's licensed for £7,500 (or $10,000) per user for a year.  "Nighthawk is the most advanced and evasive command-and-control framework available on the market," MDSec&nbsp; notes . "Nighthawk i

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious extension for Chromium-based web browsers has been observed to be distributed via a long-standing Windows information stealer called ViperSoftX .  Czech-based cybersecurity company dubbed the rogue browser add-on VenomSoftX owing to its standalone features that enable it to access website visits, steal credentials and clipboard data, and even swap cryptocurrency addresses via an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attack.  ViperSoftX, which first&nbsp; came to light &nbsp;in February 2020, was characterized by&nbsp; Fortinet &nbsp;as a JavaScript-based remote access trojan and cryptocurrency stealer. The malware's use of a browser extension to advance its information-gathering goals was documented by Sophos threat analyst&nbsp; Colin Cowie &nbsp;earlier this year.   "This multi-stage stealer exhibits interesting hiding capabilities, concealed as small PowerShell scripts on a single line in the middle of otherwise innocent-looking large log files, among others," Avast researcher Jan Rubín&nbsp; said

The notorious Emotet malware has returned with renewed vigor as part of a high-volume malspam campaign designed to drop payloads like&nbsp; IcedID &nbsp;and&nbsp; Bumblebee .

Google Cloud last week disclosed that it identified 34 different hacked release versions of the Cobalt Strike tool in the wild, the earliest of which&nbsp; shipped &nbsp;in November 2012.

The LodaRAT malware has resurfaced with new variants that are being deployed in conjunction with other sophisticated malware, such as RedLine Stealer and Neshta.  "The ease of access to its source code makes LodaRAT an attractive tool for any threat actor who is interested in its capabilities," Cisco Talos researcher Chris Neal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published Thursday.

An AutoIT-based malware, LodaRAT (aka&nbsp; Nymeria ) is attributed to a group called Kasablanca and is capable of harvesting sensitive information from compromised machines.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has removed two new malicious dropper apps that have been detected on the Play Store for Android, one of which posed as a lifestyle app and was caught distributing the Xenomorph banking malware.  "Xenomorph is a trojan that steals credentials from banking applications on users' devices," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Himanshu Sharma and Viral Gandhi&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published Thursday.  "It is also capable of intercepting users' SMS messages and notifications, enabling it to steal one-time passwords and multi-factor authentication requests."   The cybersecurity firm said it also found an expense tracker app that exhibited similar behavior, but noted that it couldn't extract the URL used to fetch the malware artifact.   The two malicious apps are as follows -   Todo: Day manager (com.todo.daymanager)  経費キーパー (com.setprice.expenses)   Both the apps function as a dropper, meaning the apps themselves are harmless and are a conduit to retrieve t

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious package discovered on the Python Package Index (PyPI) has been found employing a steganographic trick to conceal malicious code within image files.  The package in question, named " apicolor ," was uploaded to the Python third-party repository on October 31, 2022, and described as a "Core lib for REST API," according to Israeli cybersecurity firm&nbsp; Check Point . It has since been&nbsp; taken down .   Apicolor, like other&nbsp; rogue packages &nbsp;detected recently, harbors its malicious behavior in the setup script used to specify metadata associated with the package, such as its dependencies.  This takes the form of a second package called "judyb" as well as a seemingly harmless PNG file ("8F4D2uF.png") hosted on Imgur, an image-sharing service.   "The judyb code turned out to be a steganography module, responsible [for] hiding and revealing hidden messages inside pictures," Check Point explained.  The attack chain entails using the judy

New IceXLoader Malware Loader Variant Infected Thousands of Victims Worldwide<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/new-icexloader-malware-loader-variant.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An updated version of a malware loader codenamed&nbsp; IceXLoader &nbsp;is suspected of having compromised thousands of personal and enterprise Windows machines across the world.  IceXLoader is a commodity malware that's sold for $118 on underground forums for a lifetime license. It's chiefly employed to download and execute additional malware on breached hosts.  This past June, Fortinet FortiGuard Labs said it&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;a version of the trojan written in the Nim programming language with the goal of evading analysis and detection.   "While the version discovered in June (v3.0) looked like a work-in-progress, we recently observed a newer v3.3.3 loader which looks to be fully functionable and includes a multi-stage delivery chain," Natalie Zargarov, cybersecurity researcher at Minerva Labs,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday.  IceXLoader is traditionally distributed through phishing campaigns, with emails containing ZIP archives functioning as a trigger to deploy the malwar

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cryptocurrency users are being targeted with a new clipper malware strain dubbed&nbsp; Laplas &nbsp;by means of another malware known as SmokeLoader.  SmokeLoader, which is delivered by means of weaponized documents sent through spear-phishing emails, further acts as a conduit for other&nbsp; commodity trojans &nbsp;like&nbsp; SystemBC &nbsp;and&nbsp; Raccoon Stealer 2.0 , according to an&nbsp; analysis &nbsp;from Cyble.   Observed in the wild since circa 2013,&nbsp; SmokeLoader &nbsp;functions as a generic loader capable of distributing additional payloads onto compromised systems, such as information-stealing malware and other implants. In July 2022, it was found to deploy a backdoor called&nbsp; Amadey .  Cyble said it discovered over 180 samples of the Laplas since October 24, 2022, suggesting a wide deployment.   Clippers, also called ClipBankers, fall under a category of malware that Microsoft calls&nbsp; cryware , which are designed to steal crypto by keeping close tabs on a victim's clipboard activity and swapping the original wallet ad

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered 29 packages in Python Package Index (PyPI), the official third-party software repository for the Python programming language, that aim to infect developers' machines with a malware called W4SP Stealer .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Raccoon Stealer is back on the news again. US officials arrested Mark Sokolovsky, one of the malware actors behind this program. In July 2022, after several months of the shutdown, a Raccoon Stealer V2 went viral. Last week, the Department of Justice's press release stated that the malware collected 50 million credentials.  This article will give a quick guide to the latest info stealer's version.  What is Raccoon infostealer V2?  Raccoon Stealer &nbsp;is a kind of malware that steals various data from an infected computer. It's quite a basic malware, but hackers have made Raccoon popular with excellent service and simple navigation.&nbsp;  In 2019, Raccoon infostealer was one of the most discussed malware. In exchange for $75 per week and $200 per month, cybercriminals sold this simple but versatile info stealer as a MaaS. The malware was successful in attacking a number of systems. In March 2022, however, threat authors ceased to operate.&nbsp;  An updated version of this malware was r

Experts Warn of SandStrike Android Spyware Infecting Devices via Malicious VPN App<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/experts-warn-of-sandstrike-android.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Android spyware campaign has been found striking Persian-speaking individuals by masquerading as a seemingly harmless VPN application.  Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky is tracking the campaign under the moniker&nbsp; SandStrike . It has not been attributed to any particular threat group.  "SandStrike is distributed as a means to access resources about the&nbsp; Bahá'í religion &nbsp;that are banned in Iran," the company noted in its&nbsp; APT trends report &nbsp;for the third quarter of 2022.   While the app is ostensibly designed to provide victims with a VPN connection to bypass the ban, it's also configured to covertly siphon data from the victims' devices, such as call logs, contacts, and even connect to a remote server to fetch additional commands.  The booby-trapped VPN service, while fully functional, is said to be distributed via a Telegram channel controlled by the adversary.

Five malicious dropper Android apps with over 130,000 cumulative installations have been discovered on the Google Play Store distributing banking trojans like&nbsp; SharkBot &nbsp;and&nbsp; Vultur , which are capable of stealing financial data and performing on-device fraud.  "These droppers continue the unstopping evolution of malicious apps sneaking to the official store," Dutch mobile security firm ThreatFabric told The Hacker News in a statement.  "This evolution includes following newly introduced policies and masquerading as file managers and overcoming limitations by side-loading the malicious payload through the web browser."  Targets of these&nbsp; droppers &nbsp;include 231 banking and cryptocurrency wallet apps from financial institutions in Italy, the U.K., Germany, Spain, Poland, Austria, the U.S., Australia, France, and the Netherlands.

As many as 85 command-and-control (C2) servers have been&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;supported by the ShadowPad malware since September 2021, with infrastructure detected as recently as October 16, 2022.  That's according to VMware's Threat Analysis Unit (TAU), which&nbsp; studied &nbsp;three ShadowPad variants using TCP, UDP, and HTTP(S) protocols for C2 communications.  ShadowPad , seen as a successor to&nbsp; PlugX , is a modular malware platform privately shared among multiple Chinese state-sponsored actors since 2015.   Taiwanese cybersecurity firm TeamT5, earlier this May, disclosed details of another China-nexus modular implant named&nbsp; Pangolin8RAT , which is believed to be the successor of the PlugX and ShadowPad malware families, linking it to a threat group dubbed Tianwu.   An analysis of the three ShadowPad artifacts, which have been previously put to use by&nbsp; Winnti ,&nbsp; Tonto Team , and an emerging threat cluster codenamed&nbsp; Space Pirates , made it possible to discover the C2 servers by scanning th

The Iranian threat actor known as Domestic Kitten  has been attributed to a new mobile campaign that masquerades as a translation app to distribute an updated variant of an Android malware known as FurBall.

The updates, while retaining the same surveillance functionality as earlier versions, are designed to evade detection by security solutions, the Slovak cybersecurity firm added.  Domestic Kitten, also called APT-C-50, is an Iranian threat activity cluster that has been previously identified as targeting individuals of interest with the goal of harvesting sensitive information from compromised mobile devices.

New Ursnif Variant Likely Shifting Focus to Ransomware and Data Theft<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/latest-ursnif-variant-shifts-focus-from.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Ursnif malware has become the latest malware to shed its roots as a banking trojan to revamp itself into a generic backdoor capable of delivering next-stage payloads, joining the likes of Emotet, Qakbot, and TrickBot.  "This is a significant shift from the malware's original purpose to enable banking fraud, but is consistent with the broader threat landscape," Mandiant researchers Sandor Nemes, Sulian Lebegue, and Jessa Valdez&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a Wednesday analysis.   The refreshed and refactored variant, first spotted by the Google-owned threat intelligence firm in the wild on June 23, 2022, has been codenamed LDR4, in what's being seen as an attempt to lay the groundwork for potential ransomware and data theft extortion operations.  Ursnif, also called Gozi or ISFB, is one of the oldest banker malware families, with&nbsp; the earliest documented attacks &nbsp;going as far back as 2007. Check Point, in August 2020, mapped the " divergent evolution of Gozi " over th

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The China-aligned espionage-focused actor dubbed Winnti has set its sights on government organizations in Hong Kong as part of an ongoing campaign dubbed&nbsp; Operation CuckooBees .  Active since at least 2007,&nbsp; Winnti &nbsp;(aka APT41, Barium, Bronze Atlas, and Wicked Panda) is the name designated to a prolific cyber threat group that carries out Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity, predominantly aimed at stealing intellectual property from organizations in developed economies.  The threat actor's campaigns have targeted healthcare, telecoms, high-tech, media, agriculture, and education sectors, with infection chains primarily relying on spear-phishing emails with attachments to initially break into the victims' networks.  Earlier this May, Cybereason&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;long-running attacks orchestrated by the group since 2019 to siphon technology secrets from technology and manufacturing companies mainly located in East Asia, Western Europe, and North America.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A PHP version of an information-stealing malware called&nbsp; Ducktail &nbsp;has been discovered in the wild being distributed in the form of cracked installers for legitimate apps and games, according to the latest findings from Zscaler.  "Like older versions (.NetCore), the latest version (PHP) also aims to exfiltrate sensitive information related to saved browser credentials, Facebook account information, etc.," Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Tarun Dewan and Stuti Chaturvedi&nbsp; said .   Ducktail, which emerged on the threat landscape in late 2021, is attributed to an unnamed Vietnamese threat actor, with the malware primarily designed to hijack Facebook business and advertising accounts.  The financially motivated cybercriminal operation was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;by Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure (formerly F-Secure) in late July 2022.   While previous versions of the malware were found to use Telegram as a command-and-control (C2) channel to exfiltrate information, the PHP var

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code has been made available for the recently disclosed critical security flaw affecting Fortinet FortiOS, FortiProxy, and FortiSwitchManager, making it imperative that users move quickly to apply the patches.  "FortiOS exposes a management web portal that allows a user to configure the system," Horizon3.ai researcher James Horseman&nbsp; said . "Additionally, a user can SSH into the system which exposes a locked down CLI interface."   The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2022-40684 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.6), concerns an&nbsp; authentication bypass &nbsp;vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to perform malicious operations on the administrative interface via specially crafted HTTP(S) requests.  A successful exploitation of the shortcoming is tantamount to granting complete access "to do just about anything" on the affected system, including altering network configurations, adding malicious users, and intercepting network traffic.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented command-and-control (C2) framework dubbed Alchimist is likely being used in the wild to target Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.  "Alchimist C2 has a web interface written in Simplified Chinese and can generate a configured payload, establish remote sessions, deploy payload to the remote machines, capture screenshots, perform remote shellcode execution, and run arbitrary commands," Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Written in GoLang, Alchimist is complemented by a beacon implant called Insekt, which comes with remote access features that can be instrumented by the C2 server.   The discovery of Alchimist and its assorted family of malware implants comes three months after Talos also detailed another self-contained framework known as&nbsp; Manjusaka , which has been&nbsp; touted &nbsp;as the "Chinese sibling of Sliver and Cobalt Strike."  Even more interestingly, both Manjusaka and Alchimist pack in similar functionalities, desp

An unofficial version of the popular WhatsApp messaging app called YoWhatsApp has been observed deploying an Android trojan known as Triada.  The goal of the malware is to steal the keys that "allow the use of a WhatsApp account&nbsp; without the app ," Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "If the keys are stolen, a user of a malicious WhatsApp mod can lose control over their account."   YoWhatsApp offers the ability for users to lock chats, send messages to unsaved numbers, and customize the app with a variety of theming options. It's also said to share overlaps with other modded WhatsApp clients such as FMWhatsApp and HeyMods.  The Russian cybersecurity company said it found the malicious functionality in YoWhatsApp version 2.22.11.75.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new piece of research has detailed the increasingly sophisticated nature of the malware toolset employed by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group named Earth Aughisky .  "Over the last decade, the group has continued to make adjustments in the tools and malware deployments on specific targets located in Taiwan and, more recently, Japan," Trend Micro&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a technical profile last week.  Earth Aughisky, also known as&nbsp; Taidoor , is a cyber espionage group that's known for its ability to abuse legitimate accounts, software, applications, and other weaknesses in the network design and infrastructure for its own ends.  While the Chinese threat actor has been known to primarily target organizations in Taiwan, victimology patterns observed towards late 2017 indicate an expansion to Japan.   The most commonly targeted industry verticals include government, telcom, manufacturing, heavy, technology, transportation, and healthcare.  Attack chains mounted by the group

Meta Platforms on Friday disclosed that it had identified over 400 malicious apps on Android and iOS that it said targeted online users with the goal of stealing their Facebook login information.

Interestingly, a majority of the iOS apps posed as ads manager tools for Meta and its Facebook subsidiary.  Besides concealing its malicious nature as a set of seemingly harmless apps, the operators of the scheme also published fake reviews that were designed to offset the negative reviews left by users who may have previously downloaded the apps

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Nicknamed ProxyNotShell, a new exploit used in the wild takes advantage of the recently published Microsoft Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability CVE-2022-41040 and a second vulnerability, CVE-2022-41082 that allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) when PowerShell is available to unidentified attackers.  Based on ProxyShell, this new zero-day abuse risk leverage a chained attack similar to the one used in the 2021 ProxyShell attack that exploited the combination of multiple vulnerabilities - CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-34473, and CVE-2021-31207 – to permit a remote actor to execute arbitrary code.  Despite the potential severity of attacks using them, ProxyShell vulnerabilities are still on CISA's list of top 2021 routinely exploited vulnerabilities.  Meet ProxyNotShell&nbsp;  Recorded on September 19, 2022, CVE-2022-41082 is an attack vector targeting Microsoft's Exchange Servers, enabling attacks of low complexity with low privileges required.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors have been found deploying never-before-seen post-compromise implants in VMware's virtualization software to seize control of infected systems and evade detection.  Google's Mandiant threat intelligence division referred to it as a "novel malware ecosystem" that impacts VMware ESXi, Linux vCenter servers, and Windows virtual machines, allowing attackers to maintain persistent access to the&nbsp; hypervisor &nbsp;as well as execute arbitrary commands.  The&nbsp; hyperjacking attacks , per the cybersecurity vendor, involved the use of malicious vSphere Installation Bundles ( VIBs ) to sneak in two implants, dubbed VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE, on the ESXi hypervisors.   "It is important to highlight that this is not an external remote code execution vulnerability; the attacker needs admin-level privileges to the ESXi hypervisor before they can deploy malware," Mandiant researchers Alexander Marvi, Jeremy Koppen, Tufail Ahmed, and Jonathan Lepore said in an exhaus

A new, multi-functional Go-based malware dubbed&nbsp; Chaos &nbsp;has been rapidly growing in volume in recent months to ensnare a wide range of Windows, Linux, small office/home office (SOHO) routers, and enterprise servers into its botnet.  "Chaos functionality includes the ability to enumerate the host environment, run remote shell commands, load additional modules, automatically propagate through stealing and brute-forcing SSH private keys, as well as launch DDoS attacks," researchers from Lumen's Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up shared with The Hacker News.  A majority of the bots are located in Europe, specifically Italy, with other infections reported in China and the U.S., collectively representing "hundreds of unique IP addresses" over a one-month time period from mid-June through mid-July 2022.

Cybercriminals are continuing to prey on users searching for cracked software by directing them to fraudulent websites hosting weaponized installers that deploy malware called&nbsp; NullMixer&nbsp; on compromised systems.  "When a user extracts and executes NullMixer, it drops a number of malware files to the compromised machine," cybersecurity firm Kaspersky said in a Monday report. "It drops a wide variety of malicious binaries to infect the machine with, such as backdoors, bankers, downloaders, spyware, and many others."  Besides siphoning users' credentials, address, credit card data, cryptocurrencies, and even Facebook and Amazon account session cookies, what makes NullMixer insidious is its ability to download dozens of trojans at once, significantly widening the scale of the infections.   Attack chains typically start when a user attempts to download cracked software from one of the sites, which leads to a password-protected archive that contains an executable fil

As many as 75 apps on Google Play and 10 on Apple App Store have been discovered engaging in ad fraud as part of an ongoing campaign that commenced in 2019.  The latest iteration, dubbed&nbsp; Scylla &nbsp;by Online fraud-prevention firm HUMAN Security, follows similar attack waves in August 2019 and late 2020 that go by the codename Poseidon and Charybdis, respectively.  Prior to their removal from the app storefronts, the apps had been collectively installed more than 13 million times.   The original Poseidon operation comprised over 40 Android apps that were designed to display ads out of context or hidden from the view of the device user.  Charybdis, on the other hand, was an improvement over the former by making use of code obfuscation tactics to target advertising platforms.   Scylla presents the latest adaption of the scheme in that it expands beyond Android to make a foray into the iOS ecosystem for the first time, alongside relying on additional layers of code roundabout using the&nbsp; All

Researchers Find Link b/w PrivateLoader and Ruzki Pay-Per-Install Services<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/researchers-find-link-bw-privateloader.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have exposed new connections between a widely used pay-per-install (PPI) malware service known as PrivateLoader and another PPI platform offered by a cybercriminal actor dubbed ruzki.  "The threat actor ruzki (aka les0k, zhigalsz) advertises their PPI service on underground Russian-speaking forums and their Telegram channels under the name ruzki or zhigalsz since at least May 2021," SEKOIA  said.  The cybersecurity firm said its investigations into the twin services led it to conclude that PrivateLoader is the proprietary loader of the ruzki PPI malware service.  PrivateLoader, as the name implies, functions as a C++-based loader to download and deploy additional malicious payloads on infected Windows hosts. It's primarily distributed through SEO-optimized websites that claim to provide cracked software.  Although it was&nbsp; first documented &nbsp;earlier this February by Intel471, it's said to have been put to use starting as early as May 2021.   S

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Gamers looking for cheats on YouTube are being targeted with links to malicious password-protected archive files designed to install the RedLine Stealer malware and crypto miners on compromised machines.  "The videos advertise cheats and cracks and provide instructions on hacking popular games and software," Kaspersky security researcher Oleg Kupreev&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today.   Games mentioned in the videos are APB Reloaded, CrossFire, DayZ, Farming Simulator, Farthest Frontier, FIFA 22, Final Fantasy XIV, Forza, Lego Star Wars, Sniper Elite, and Spider-Man, among others.   Downloading the self-extracting RAR archive leads to the execution of Redline Stealer, a coin miner, as well as a number of other binaries that enable the bundle's self-propagation.  Specifically, this is achieved by means of an open-source C#-based password stealer that's capable of extracting cookies from browsers, which is then used by the operators to gain unauthorized access to

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 has detailed the inner workings of a malware called&nbsp; OriginLogger , which has been touted as a successor to the widely used information stealer and remote access trojan (RAT) known as&nbsp; Agent Tesla .  A .NET based keylogger and remote access, Agent Tesla has had a long-standing presence in the threat landscape, allowing malicious actors to gain remote access to targeted systems and beacon sensitive information to an actor-controlled domain.  Known to be used in the wild since 2014, it's advertised for sale on dark web forums and is generally distributed through malicious spam emails as an attachment.  In February 2021, cybersecurity firm Sophos&nbsp; disclosed two new variants &nbsp;of the commodity malware (version 2 and 3) that featured capabilities to steal credentials from web browsers, email apps, and VPN clients, as well as use Telegram API for command-and-control.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new piece of stealthy Linux malware called Shikitega has been uncovered adopting a multi-stage infection chain to compromise endpoints and IoT devices and deposit additional payloads.  "An attacker can gain full control of the system, in addition to the cryptocurrency miner that will be executed and set to persist," AT&amp;T Alien Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published Tuesday.  The findings add to a growing list of Linux malware that has been found in the wild in recent months, including&nbsp; BPFDoor ,&nbsp; Symbiote ,&nbsp; Syslogk ,&nbsp; OrBit , and&nbsp; Lightning Framework .   Once deployed on a targeted host, the attack chain downloads and executes the Metasploit's " Mettle " meterpreter to maximize control, exploits vulnerabilities to elevate its privileges, adds persistence on the host via crontab, and ultimately launches a cryptocurrency miner on infected devices.  The exact method by which the initial compromise is achieved remains unknown as yet, but what makes Shikitega

Prynt Stealer, which&nbsp; came to light &nbsp;earlier this April, comes with capabilities to log keystrokes, steal credentials from web browsers, and siphon data from Discord and Telegram. It's sold for $100 for a one-month license and $900 for a lifetime subscription.   The cybersecurity firm analysis of Prynt Stealer shows that its codebase is derived from two other open source malware families,&nbsp; AsyncRAT &nbsp;and

New Evidence Links Raspberry Robin Malware to Dridex and Russian Evil Corp Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/new-evidence-links-raspberry-robin.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have identified functional similarities between a malicious component used in the Raspberry Robin infection chain and a Dridex malware loader, further strengthening the operators' connections to the Russia-based Evil Corp group.  The findings suggest that "Evil Corp is likely using Raspberry Robin infrastructure to carry out its attacks," IBM Security X-Force researcher Kevin Henson&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday analysis.  Raspberry Robin (aka QNAP Worm), first&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;by cybersecurity company Red Canary in September 2021, has remained something of a mystery for nearly a year, partly owing to the noticeable lack of post-exploitation activities in the wild.   That changed in July 2022 when Microsoft&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that it observed the&nbsp; FakeUpdates &nbsp;(aka SocGholish) malware being delivered via existing Raspberry Robin infections, with potential connections identified between DEV-0206 and DEV-0243 (aka Evil Corp).  The malware is known to be delivered from a compromised

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A persistent Golang-based malware campaign dubbed GO#WEBBFUSCATOR has leveraged the deep field image taken from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as a lure to deploy malicious payloads on infected systems.  The development, revealed by Securonix , points to the growing adoption of Go among threat actors, given the programming language's cross-platform support, effectively allowing the operators to leverage a common codebase to target different operating systems.  Go binaries also have the added benefit of&nbsp;rendering reverse engineering a lot more challenging as opposed to malware written in other languages like C++ or C#, not to mention prolong analysis and detection attempts.  Phishing emails containing a Microsoft Office attachment act as the entry point for the attack chain that, when opened, retrieves an obfuscated VBA macro, which, in turn, is auto-executed should the recipient enable macros.   The execution of the macro results in the download of an image file &amp;quo

WordPress sites are being hacked to display fraudulent Cloudflare DDoS protection pages that lead to the delivery of malware such as NetSupport RAT and Raccoon Stealer.  "A recent surge in JavaScript injections targeting WordPress sites has resulted in fake DDoS prevent prompts which lead victims to download remote access trojan malware," Sucuri's Ben Martin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published last week.  Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection pages are essential browser verification checks designed to deter bot-driven unwanted and malicious traffic from eating up bandwidth and taking down websites.  The new attack vector involves hijacking WordPress sites to display fake DDoS protection pop-ups that, when clicked, ultimately lead to the download of a malicious ISO file ("security_install.iso") to the victim's systems.   This is achieved by injecting three lines of code into a JavaScript file ("jquery.min.js"), or alternatively into the active

The operators of the XCSSET macOS malware have upped the stakes by making iterative improvements that add support for macOS Monterey by upgrading its source code components to Python 3.

Atlanta-based cyber risk intelligence company, Cyble discovered a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) malware. What makes this particular RAT malware distinct enough to be named after the&nbsp; comic creation of Sacha Baron Cohen ?  RAT malware typically helps cybercriminals gain complete control of a victim's system, permitting them to access network resources, files, and power to toggle the mouse and keyboard. Borat RAT malware goes beyond the standard features and enables threat actors to deploy ransomware and&nbsp; DDoS attacks . It also increases the number of threat actors who can launch attacks, sometimes appealing to the lowest common denominator. The added functionality of carrying out DDoS attacks makes it insidious and a risk to today's digital organizations.  Ransomware has been the most common top attack type for over&nbsp; three years . According to an IBM report, REvil was the most common ransomware strain, consisting of about&nbsp; 37% &nbsp;of all ransomware attacks. Borat RAT is a unique

Researchers Detail Evasive DarkTortilla Crypter Used to Deliver Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/researchers-detail-evasive-darktortilla.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A .NET-based evasive crypter named&nbsp; DarkTortilla&nbsp; has been used by threat actors to distribute a broad array of commodity malware as well as targeted payloads like Cobalt Strike and Metasploit, likely&nbsp; since 2015 .  "It can also deliver 'add-on packages' such as additional malicious payloads, benign decoy documents, and executables," cybersecurity firm Secureworks&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report. "It features robust anti-analysis and anti-tamper controls that can make detection, analysis, and eradication challenging."  Malware delivered by the crypter includes information steakers and remote access trojans (RATs) such as Agent Tesla, AsyncRat, NanoCore, and RedLine Stealer. "DarkTortilla has versatility that similar malware does not," the researchers noted.   Crypters are&nbsp; software tools &nbsp;that use a&nbsp; combination &nbsp;of encryption, obfuscation, and code manipulation of malware so as to&nbsp; bypass detection &nbsp;by security solutions.  The delivery of DarkTortil

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More than 1.31 million users attempted to install malicious or unwanted web browser extensions at least once, new findings from cybersecurity firm Kaspersky show.  "From January 2020 to June 2022, more than 4.3 million unique users were attacked by adware hiding in browser extensions, which is approximately 70% of all users affected by malicious and unwanted add-ons," the company&nbsp; said .  As many as 1,311,557 users fall under this category in the first half of 2022, per Kaspersky's telemetry data. In comparison, the number of such users peaked in 2020 at 3,660,236, followed by 1,823,263 unique users in 2021.  The most prevalent threat is a family of adware called WebSearch, which masquerade as PDF viewers and other utilities, and comes with capabilities to collect and analyze search queries and redirect users to affiliate links.   WebSearch is also notable for modifying the browser's start page, which contains a search engine and a number of links to third-party sour

SOVA Android Banking Trojan Returns With New Capabilities and Targets<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/sova-android-banking-trojan-returns-new.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The SOVA Android banking trojan is continuing to be actively developed with upgraded capabilities to target no less than 200 mobile applications, including banking apps and crypto exchanges and wallets, up from 90 apps when it started out.  That's according to the latest findings from Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy, which found newer versions of the malware sporting functionality to intercept two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, steal cookies, and expand its targeting to cover Australia, Brazil, China, India, the Philippines, and the U.K.  SOVA, meaning Owl in Russian, came to light in&nbsp; September 2021 &nbsp;when it was observed striking financial and shopping apps from the U.S. and Spain for harvesting credentials through overlay attacks by taking advantage of Android's Accessibility services.   In less than a year, the trojan has also acted as a foundation for another Android malware called&nbsp; MaliBot &nbsp;that's designed to target online banking and cryptocurrency wallet custo

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A now-removed rogue package pushed to the official third-party software repository for Python has been found to deploy cryptominers on Linux systems.  The module, named " secretslib " and&nbsp; downloaded 93 times &nbsp;prior to its deletion, was released to the Python Package Index (PyPI) on August 6, 2022 and is described as "secrets matching and verification made easy."   "On a closer inspection though, the package covertly runs cryptominers on your Linux machine in-memory (directly from your RAM), a technique largely employed by fileless malware and crypters," Sonatype researcher Ax Sharma&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in a report last week.  It achieves this by executing a Linux executable file retrieved from a remote server post installation, whose main task is to drop an&nbsp; ELF &nbsp;file (" memfd ") directly in memory that functions as a Monero cryptominer, after which it gets deleted by the "secretslib" package.

Threat actors are increasingly mimicking legitimate applications like Skype, Adobe Reader, and VLC Player as a means to abuse trust relationships and increase the likelihood of a successful social engineering attack.  Other most impersonated legitimate apps by icon include 7-Zip, TeamViewer, CCleaner, Microsoft Edge, Steam, Zoom, and WhatsApp, an analysis from VirusTotal has revealed.  "One of the simplest social engineering tricks we've seen involves making a malware sample seem a legitimate program," VirusTotal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. "The icon of these programs is a critical feature used to convince victims that these programs are legitimate."  It's no surprise that threat actors resort to a variety of approaches to compromise endpoints by tricking unwitting users into downloading and running seemingly innocuous executables.   This, in turn, is primarily achieved by taking advantage of genuine domains in a bid to get around IP-based firewall defenses

Gootkit Loader Resurfaces with Updated Tactic to Compromise Targeted Computers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/gootkit-loader-resurfaces-with-updated.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators of the Gootkit access-as-a-service ( AaaS ) malware have resurfaced with updated techniques to compromise unsuspecting victims.  "In the past, Gootkit used freeware installers to mask malicious files; now it uses legal documents to trick users into downloading these files," Trend Micro researchers Buddy Tancio and Jed Valderama&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up last week.   The findings build on a previous report from eSentire, which&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in January of widespread attacks aimed at employees of accounting and law firms to deploy malware on infected systems.  Gootkit is part of the proliferating underground ecosystem of access brokers, who are known to provide other malicious actors a pathway into corporate networks for a price, paving the way for actual damaging attacks such as ransomware.   The loader utilizes malicious search engine results, a technique called&nbsp; SEO poisoning , to lure unsuspecting users into visiting compromised websites hosting malware-laced ZIP pac

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious campaign leveraged seemingly innocuous Android dropper apps on the Google Play Store to compromise users' devices with&nbsp; banking &nbsp; malware .  These 17 dropper apps, collectively dubbed&nbsp; DawDropper &nbsp;by Trend Micro, masqueraded as productivity and utility apps such as document scanners, QR code readers, VPN services, and call recorders, among others. All these apps in question have been removed from the app marketplace.   "DawDropper uses Firebase Realtime Database, a third-party cloud service, to evade detection and dynamically obtain a payload download address," the researchers&nbsp; said . "It also hosts malicious payloads on GitHub."   Droppers are apps designed to sneak past Google's Play Store security checks, following which they are used to download more potent and intrusive malware on a device, in this case,&nbsp; Octo &nbsp;(Coper),&nbsp; Hydra ,&nbsp; Ermac , and&nbsp; TeaBot .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As many as 30 malicious Android apps with cumulative downloads of nearly 10 million have been found on the Google Play Store distributing adware.  "All of them were built into various programs, including image-editing software, virtual keyboards, system tools and utilities, calling apps, wallpaper collection apps, and others," Dr.Web&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday write-up.  While masquerading as innocuous apps, their primary goal is to request permissions to show windows over other apps and run in the background in order to serve intrusive ads.  To make it difficult for the victims to detect and uninstall the apps, the adware trojans hide their icons from the list of installed apps in the home screen or replace the icons with others that are likely to be less noticed (e.g., SIM Toolkit).   Some of these apps also offer the advertised features, as observed in the case of two apps: "Water Reminder- Tracker &amp; Reminder" and "Yoga- For Beginner to Advanced." However

Facebook business and advertising accounts are at the receiving end of an ongoing campaign dubbed&nbsp; Ducktail &nbsp;designed to seize control as part of a financially driven cybercriminal operation.&nbsp;  "The threat actor targets individuals and employees that may have access to a Facebook Business account with an information-stealer malware," Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure (formerly F-Secure Business)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.

Malicious IIS Extensions Gaining Popularity Among Cyber Criminals for Persistent Access<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/malicious-iis-extensions-gaining.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are increasingly abusing Internet Information Services ( IIS ) extensions to backdoor servers as a means of establishing a "durable persistence mechanism."  That's according to a&nbsp; new warning &nbsp;from the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team, which said that "IIS backdoors are also harder to detect since they mostly reside in the same directories as legitimate modules used by target applications, and they follow the same code structure as clean modules."  Attack chains taking this approach commence with weaponizing a critical vulnerability in the hosted application for initial access, using this foothold to drop a script web shell as the first stage payload.   This web shell then becomes the conduit for installing a rogue IIS module to provide highly covert and persistent access to the server, in addition to monitoring incoming and outgoing requests as well as running remote commands.  Indeed, earlier this month, Kaspersky researchers disclosed a cam

An information-stealing malware called Amadey is being distributed by means of another backdoor called SmokeLoader.

Amadey , a botnet that&nbsp; first appeared &nbsp;around October 2018 on Russian underground forums for $600, is equipped to siphon crendentials, capture screenshots, system metadata, and even information about antivirus engines and additional malware installed on an infected machine.   While an update was spotted last July by Walmart Global Tech&nbsp; incorporated &nbsp;functionality for harvesting data from Mikrotik routers and Microsoft Outlook, the toolset has since been upgraded to capture information from FileZilla, Pidgin, Total Commander FTP Client, RealVNC, TightVNC, TigerVNC, and WinSCP.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown Chinese-speaking threat actor has been attributed to a new kind of sophisticated UEFI firmware rootkit called&nbsp; CosmicStrand .  "The rootkit is located in the firmware images of Gigabyte or ASUS motherboards, and we noticed that all these images are related to designs using the H81 chipset," Kaspersky researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today. "This suggests that a common vulnerability may exist that allowed the attackers to inject their rootkit into the firmware's image."  Victims identified are said to be private individuals located in China, Vietnam, Iran, and Russia, with no discernible ties to any organization or industry vertical. The attribution to a Chinese-speaking threat actor stems from code overlaps between CosmicStrand and other malware such as the MyKings botnet and MoonBounce.

The Racoon Stealer malware as a service platform gained notoriety several years ago for its ability to extract data that is stored within a Web browser.

Racoon Stealer was also designed to steal auto-fill data, which can include a vast trove of personal information ranging from basic contact data to credit card numbers. As if all of that were not enough, Racoon Stealer also had the ability to steal cryptocurrency and to steal (or drop) files on an infected system.  As bad as Racoon Stealer might have been, its developers have recently created a new version that is designed to be far more damaging than the version that previously existed.&nbsp;   New Racoon Stealer Capabilities  The new version of Raccoon Stealer &nbsp;still has the ability to steal browser passwords, cookies, and auto-fill data.

New Linux Malware Framework Lets Attackers Install Rootkit on Targeted Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/new-linux-malware-framework-let.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A never-before-seen Linux malware has been dubbed a "Swiss Army Knife" for its modular architecture and its capability to install rootkits.  This previously undetected Linux threat, called&nbsp; Lightning Framework &nbsp;by Intezer, is equipped with a plethora of features, making it one of the most intricate frameworks developed for targeting Linux systems.  "The framework has both passive and active capabilities for communication with the threat actor, including opening up SSH on an infected machine, and a polymorphic malleable command and control configuration," Intezer researcher Ryan Robinson&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report published today.   Central to the malware is a downloader ("kbioset") and a core ("kkdmflush") module, the former of which is engineered to retrieve at least seven different plugins from a remote server that are subsequently invoked by the core component.  In addition, the downloader is also responsible for establishing the persistence of t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a previously undocumented spyware targeting the Apple macOS operating system.  The malware, codenamed&nbsp; CloudMensis &nbsp;by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, is said to exclusively use public cloud storage services such as pCloud, Yandex Disk, and Dropbox for receiving attacker commands and exfiltrating files.  "Its capabilities clearly show that the intent of its operators is to gather information from the victims' Macs by exfiltrating documents, keystrokes, and screen captures," ESET researcher Marc-Etienne M.Léveillé&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today.   CloudMensis, written in Objective-C, was first discovered in April 2022 and is designed to strike both Intel and Apple silicon architectures. The initial infection vector for the attacks and the targets remain unknown as yet. But its very limited distribution is an indication that the malware is being used as part of a highly targeted operation directed against entities of i

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has taken steps to ax dozens of fraudulent apps from the official Play Store that were spotted propagating Joker, Facestealer, and Coper malware families through the virtual marketplace.  While the Android storefront is considered to be a trusted source for discovering and installing apps, bad actors have repeatedly found ways to sneak past security barriers erected by Google in hopes of luring unsuspecting users into downloading malware-laced apps.  The latest findings from&nbsp; Zscaler ThreatLabz &nbsp;and&nbsp; Pradeo &nbsp;are no different. "Joker is one of the most&nbsp; prominent malware families &nbsp;targeting Android devices," researchers Viral Gandhi and Himanshu Sharma said in a Monday report.  "Despite public awareness of this particular malware, it keeps finding its way into Google's official app store by regularly modifying the malware's trace signatures including updates to the code, execution methods, and payload-retrieving techniques."

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered new variants of the&nbsp; ChromeLoader &nbsp;information-stealing malware, highlighting its evolving feature set in a short span of time.  Primarily used for hijacking victims' browser searches and presenting advertisements, ChromeLoader came to light in January 2022 and has been distributed in the form of ISO or DMG file downloads advertised via QR codes on Twitter and free gaming sites.  ChromeLoader has also been codenamed Choziosi Loader and ChromeBack by the broader cybersecurity community. What makes the adware notable is that it's fashioned as a browser extension as opposed to a Windows executable (.exe) or Dynamic Link Library (.dll).   The infections typically work by enticing unsuspecting users into downloading movie torrents or cracked video games through malvertising campaigns on pay-per-install sites and social media.  Besides requesting invasive permissions to access browser data and manipulate web requests, it's also designed t

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind the Qakbot malware are transforming their delivery vectors in an attempt to sidestep detection.  "Most recently, threat actors have transformed their techniques to evade detection by using ZIP file extensions, enticing file names with common formats, and Excel (XLM) 4.0 to trick victims into downloading malicious attachments that install Qakbot," Zscaler Threatlabz researchers Tarun Dewan and Aditya Sharma&nbsp; said .   Other methods adopted by the group include code obfuscation, introducing new layers in the attack chain from initial compromise to execution, and using multiple URLs as well as unknown file extensions (e.g., .OCX, .ooccxx, .dat, or .gyp) to deliver the payload.  Also called QBot, QuackBot, or Pinkslipbot, Qakbot has been a&nbsp; recurring threat &nbsp;since late 2007, evolving from its initial days as a banking trojan to a modular information stealer capable of deploying next-stage payloads such as&nbsp; ransomware .

A malicious browser extension with 350 variants is masquerading as a Google Translate add-on as part of an adware campaign targeting Russian users of Google Chrome, Opera, and Mozilla Firefox browsers.  Mobile security firm Zimperium dubbed the malware family&nbsp; ABCsoup , stating the "extensions are installed onto a victim's machine via a Windows-based executable, bypassing most endpoint security solutions, along with the security controls found in the official extension stores."  The rogue browser add-ons come with the same extension ID as that of Google Translate — " aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb " — in an attempt to trick users into believing that they have installed a legitimate extension.   The extensions are not available on the official browser web stores themselves. Rather they are delivered through different Windows executables that install the add-on on the victim's web browser.

Researchers have disclosed a new large-scale cryptocurrency mining campaign targeting the NPM JavaScript package repository.

Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a new and entirely undetected Linux threat dubbed&nbsp; OrBit , signally a growing trend of malware attacks geared towards the popular operating system.

"The malware implements advanced evasion techniques and gains persistence on the machine by hooking key functions, provides the threat actors with remote access capabilities over SSH, harvests credentials, and logs TTY commands."  OrBit is the fourth Linux malware to have come to light in a short span of three months after&nbsp; BPFDoor ,&nbsp; Symbiote , and&nbsp; Syslogk .   The malware also functions a lot like Symbiote in that it's designed to infect all of t

A widespread software supply chain attack has targeted the NPM package manager at least since December 2021 with rogue modules designed to steal data entered in forms by users on websites that include them.  The coordinated attack, dubbed IconBurst by ReversingLabs, involves no fewer than two dozen NPM packages that include obfuscated JavaScript, which comes with malicious code to harvest sensitive data from forms embedded downstream mobile applications and websites.  "These clearly malicious attacks relied on typo-squatting, a technique in which attackers offer up packages via public repositories with names that are similar to — or common misspellings of — legitimate packages," security researcher Karlo Zanki&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday report. "Attackers impersonated high-traffic NPM modules like umbrellajs and packages published by ionic.io."

Gardeners know that worms are good. Cybersecurity professionals know that worms are&nbsp; bad . Very bad. In fact, worms are literally the most devasting force for evil known to the computing world. The&nbsp; MyDoom &nbsp;worm holds the dubious position of most costly computer malware&nbsp; ever &nbsp;– responsible for some&nbsp; $52 billion &nbsp;in damage. In second place…&nbsp; Sobig , another worm.  It turns out, however, that there are exceptions to every rule. Some biological worms are actually&nbsp; not welcome &nbsp;in most gardens. And some cyber worms, it seems, can use their powers for good …&nbsp;  Meet Hopper, The Good Worm  Detection tools are not good at&nbsp; catching non-exploit-based propagation , which is what worms do best. Most cybersecurity solutions are less resilient to worm attack methods like token impersonation and others that take advantage of deficient internal configurations - PAM, segmentation, insecure credential storage, and more.  So, what better way to beat a stealthy worm than with … another stealthy worm?

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has detailed the evolving capabilities of toll fraud malware apps on Android, pointing out its "complex multi-step attack flow" and an improved mechanism to evade security analysis.  Toll fraud belongs to a category of billing fraud wherein malicious mobile applications come with hidden subscription fees, roping in unsuspecting users to premium content without their knowledge or consent.  It's also different from other&nbsp; fleeceware threats &nbsp;in that the malicious functions are only carried out when a compromised device is connected to one of its target network operators.  "It also, by default, uses cellular connection for its activities and forces devices to connect to the mobile network even if a Wi-Fi connection is available," Dimitrios Valsamaras and Sang Shin Jung of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an exhaustive analysis.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have documented a new information-stealing malware that targets YouTube content creators by plundering their authentication cookies.  Dubbed "YTStealer" by Intezer, the malicious tool is likely believed to be sold as a service on the dark web, with it distributed using fake installers that also drop RedLine Stealer and Vidar.  "What sets YTStealer aside from other stealers sold on the dark web market is that it is solely focused on harvesting credentials for one single service instead of grabbing everything it can get ahold of," security researcher Joakim Kenndy said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.  The malware's modus operandi, however, mirrors its counterparts in that it extracts the cookie information from the web browser's database files in the user's profile folder. The reasoning given behind targeting content creators is that it uses one of the installed browsers on the infected machine to gather YouTube channel

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A never-before-seen remote access trojan dubbed ZuoRAT  has been singling out small office/home office (SOHO) routers as part of a sophisticated campaign targeting North American and European networks.  The malware "grants the actor the ability to pivot into the local network and gain access to additional systems on the LAN by hijacking network communications to maintain an undetected foothold," researchers from Lumen Black Lotus Labs said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The stealthy operation, which targeted routers from ASUS, Cisco, DrayTek, and NETGEAR, is believed to have commenced in early 2020 during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, effectively remaining under the radar for over two years.  "Consumers and remote employees routinely use SOHO routers, but these devices are rarely monitored or patched, which makes them one of the weakest points of a network's perimeter," the company's threat intelligence team said.

New Android Banking Trojan 'Revive' Targeting Users of Spanish Financial Services<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/new-android-banking-trojan-revive.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously unknown Android banking trojan has been discovered in the wild, targeting users of the Spanish financial services company BBVA.  Said to be in its early stages of development, the malware — dubbed&nbsp; Revive &nbsp;by Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy — was first observed on June 15, 2022 and distributed by means of phishing campaigns.  "The name Revive has been chosen since one of the functionality of the malware (called by the [threat actors] precisely 'revive') is restarting in case the malware stops working, Cleafy researchers Federico Valentini and Francesco Iubatti&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday write-up.   Available for download from rogue phishing pages ("bbva.appsecureguide[.]com" or "bbva.european2fa[.]com") as a lure to trick users into downloading the app, the malware impersonates the bank's two-factor authentication (2FA) app and is said to be inspired from open-source spyware called&nbsp; Teardroid , with the authors tweaking the original source c

Researchers Warn of 'Matanbuchus' Malware Campaign Dropping Cobalt Strike Beacons<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/researchers-warn-of-matanbuchus-malware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malware-as-a-service (Maas) dubbed&nbsp; Matanbuchus &nbsp;has been observed spreading through phishing campaigns, ultimately dropping the Cobalt Strike post-exploitation framework on compromised machines.  Matanbuchus, like other&nbsp; malware loaders &nbsp;such as&nbsp; BazarLoader ,&nbsp; Bumblebee , and&nbsp; Colibri , is engineered to download and execute second-stage executables from command-and-control (C&amp;C) servers on infected systems without detection.  Available on Russian-speaking cybercrime forums for a price of $2,500 since February 2021, the malware is equipped with capabilities to launch .EXE and .DLL files in memory and run arbitrary PowerShell commands.   The findings, released by threat intelligence firm Cyble last week, document the latest infection chain associated with the loader, which is linked to a threat actor who goes by the online moniker BelialDemon.  "If we look historically, BelialDemon has been involved in the development of malware loaders," Unit 42 researchers Jeff White

Researchers have discovered a number of malicious Python packages in the official third-party software repository that are engineered to exfiltrate AWS credentials and environment variables to a publicly exposed endpoint.

The packages and as well as the endpoint have now been taken down.  "Some of these packages either contain code that reads and exfiltrates your secrets or use one of the dependencies that will do the job," Sharma&nbsp; said .   The malicious code injected into "loglib-modules" and "pygrata-utils" allow it to harvest AWS credentials, network interface information, and environment variables and export them to a remote endpoint: "hxxp://graph.pygrata[.]com:8000/upload."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware tool that enables cybercriminal actors to build malicious Windows shortcut ( .LNK ) files has been spotted for sale on cybercrime forums.  Dubbed Quantum Lnk Builder , the software makes it possible to spoof any extension and choose from over 300 icons, not to mention support&nbsp; UAC &nbsp;and&nbsp; Windows SmartScreen &nbsp;bypass as well as "multiple payloads per .LNK" file. Also offered are capabilities to generate .HTA and disk image (.ISO) payloads.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind the Rig Exploit Kit have swapped the Raccoon Stealer malware for the Dridex financial trojan as part of an ongoing campaign that commenced in January 2022.  The switch in modus operandi,&nbsp; spotted &nbsp;by Romanian company Bitdefender, comes in the wake of Raccoon Stealer&nbsp; temporarily closing the project &nbsp;after one of its team members responsible for critical operations passed away in the Russo-Ukrainian war in March 2022.  The Rig Exploit Kit is notable for its abuse of browser exploits to distribute an array of malware. First spotted in 2019, Raccoon Stealer is a credential-stealing trojan that's advertised and sold on underground forums as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) for $200 a month.   That said, the Raccoon Stealer actors are already working on a second version that's expected to be "rewritten from scratch and optimized." But the void left by the malware's exit is being filled by other information stealers such as RedLine Stealer and Vidar.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind&nbsp; BRATA &nbsp;have once again added more capabilities to the Android mobile malware in an attempt to make their attacks against financial apps more stealthy.  "In fact, the modus operandi now fits into an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) activity pattern," Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report last week. "This term is used to describe an attack campaign in which criminals establish a long-term presence on a targeted network to steal sensitive information."   An acronym for "Brazilian Remote Access Tool Android," BRATA was first&nbsp; detected &nbsp;in the wild in Brazil in late 2018, before making its first appearance in Europe last April, while masquerading as antivirus software and other common productivity tools to trick users into downloading them.  The change in the attack pattern, which scaled new highs in early April 2022, involves tailoring the malware to strike a specific financial institution at a time, switching to a differe

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new strain of Android malware has been spotted in the wild targeting online banking and cryptocurrency wallet customers in Spain and Italy, just weeks after a coordinated law enforcement operation dismantled&nbsp; FluBot .  The information stealing trojan, codenamed&nbsp; MaliBot &nbsp;by F5 Labs, is as feature-rich as its&nbsp; counterparts , allowing it to steal credentials and cookies, bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes, and abuse Android's Accessibility Service to monitor the victim's device screen.  MaliBot is known to primarily disguise itself as cryptocurrency mining apps such as Mining X or The CryptoApp that are distributed via fraudulent websites designed to attract potential visitors into downloading them.   It also takes another leaf out of the mobile banking trojan playbook in that it employs smishing as a distribution vector to proliferate the malware by accessing an infected smartphone's contacts and sending SMS messages containing links to the malware.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new covert Linux kernel rootkit named&nbsp; Syslogk &nbsp;has been spotted under development in the wild and cloaking a malicious payload that can be remotely commandeered by an adversary using a&nbsp; magic network traffic packet .  "The Syslogk rootkit is heavily based on Adore-Ng but incorporates new functionalities making the user-mode application and the kernel rootkit hard to detect," Avast security researchers David Álvarez and Jan Neduchal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Monday.  Adore-Ng, an&nbsp; open-source rootkit &nbsp;available since 2004, equips the attacker with full control over a compromised system. It also facilitates hiding processes as well as custom malicious artifacts, files, and even the kernel module, making it harder to detect.   "The module starts by hooking itself into various file systems. It digs up the inode for the root filesystem, and replaces that inode's&nbsp; readdir() &nbsp;function pointer with one of its own," LWN.net&nbsp; noted &nbsp;at the time. "The Adore ver

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off what they call a "nearly-impossible-to-detect" Linux malware that could be weaponized to backdoor infected systems.  Dubbed&nbsp; Symbiote &nbsp;by threat intelligence firms BlackBerry and Intezer, the stealthy malware is so named for its ability to conceal itself within running processes and network traffic and drain a victim's resources like a&nbsp; parasite .  The operators behind Symbiote are believed to have commenced development on the malware in November 2021, with the threat actor predominantly using it to target the financial sector in Latin America, including banks like Banco do Brasil and Caixa.  "Symbiote's main objective is to capture credentials and to facilitate backdoor access to a victim's machine," researchers Joakim Kennedy and Ismael Valenzuela said in a report  shared with The Hacker News. "What makes Symbiote different from other Linux malware is that it infects running processes rather than

<details>

Image Source:&nbsp;Toptal  The notorious Emotet malware has turned to deploy a new module designed to siphon credit card information stored in the Chrome web browser.  The credit card stealer, which exclusively singles out Chrome, has the ability to exfiltrate the collected information to different remote command-and-control (C2) servers, according to enterprise security company&nbsp; Proofpoint , which observed the component on June 6.  The development comes amid a&nbsp; spike &nbsp;in&nbsp; Emotet &nbsp; activity &nbsp;since it was resurrected late last year following a 10-month-long hiatus in the wake of a law enforcement operation that&nbsp; took down its attack infrastructure &nbsp;in January 2021.  Emotet, attributed to a threat actor known as TA542 (aka Mummy Spider or Gold Crestwood), is an advanced, self-propagating and modular trojan that's delivered via email campaigns and is used as a distributor for other payloads such as ransomware.   As of April 2022, Emotet is still the most popular malware with a global impac

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Parrot traffic direction system (TDS) that came to light earlier this year has had a larger impact than previously thought, according to new research.  Sucuri, which has been tracking the same campaign since February 2019 under the name "NDSW/NDSX," said that "the malware was one of the top infections" detected in 2021, accounting for more than 61,000 websites.  Parrot TDS was&nbsp; documented &nbsp;in April 2022 by Czech cybersecurity company Avast, noting that the PHP script had ensnared web servers hosting more than 16,500 websites to act as a gateway for further attack campaigns.  This involves appending a piece of malicious code to all JavaScript files on compromised web servers hosting content management systems (CMS) such as WordPress that are in turn said to be breached by taking advantage of weak login credentials and vulnerable plugins.   Besides using different obfuscation tactics to conceal the code, the "injected JavaScript may also be found well indent

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a zero-day flaw in Microsoft Office that could be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution on affected Windows systems.  The vulnerability came to light after an independent cybersecurity research team known as nao_sec uncovered a Word document (" 05-2022-0438.doc ") that was uploaded to VirusTotal from an IP address in Belarus.  "It uses Word's external link to load the HTML and then uses the 'ms-msdt' scheme to execute PowerShell code," the researchers&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in a series of tweets last week.   According to security researcher Kevin Beaumont, who dubbed the flaw "Follina," the maldoc leverages Word's&nbsp; remote template &nbsp;feature to fetch an HTML file from a server, which then makes use of the "ms-msdt://" URI scheme to run the malicious payload.  The shortcoming has been so named because the malicious sample references 0438, which is the area code of Follina, a municipality in t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malvertising threat is witnessing a new surge in activity since its emergence earlier this year.  Dubbed ChromeLoader , the malware is a "pervasive and persistent browser hijacker that modifies its victims' browser settings and redirects user traffic to advertisement websites," Aedan Russell of Red Canary&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.  ChromeLoader is a rogue Chrome browser extension and is typically distributed in the form of ISO files via pay-per-install sites and baited social media posts that advertise QR codes to cracked video games and pirated movies.   While it primarily functions by hijacking user search queries to Google, Yahoo, and Bing and redirecting traffic to an advertising site, it's also notable for its use of PowerShell to inject itself into the browser and get the extension added.   The malware, also known as Choziosi Loader, was first documented by G DATA earlier this February.   "For now the only purpose is getting revenue via unsolicited adverti

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In this day and age, we are not dealing with roughly pieced together, homebrew type of viruses anymore. Malware is an industry, and professional developers are found to exchange, be it by stealing one's code or deliberate collaboration. Attacks are multi-layer these days, with diverse sophisticated software apps taking over different jobs along the attack-chain from initial compromise to ultimate data exfiltration or encryption. The specific tools for each stage are highly specialized and can often be rented as a service, including customer support and subscription models for professional (ab)use. Obviously, this has largely increased both the availability and the potential effectiveness and impact of malware. Sound scary?&nbsp;  Well, it does, but the apparent professionalization actually does have some good sides too. One factor is that certain reused modules commonly found in malware can be used to identify, track, and analyze professional attack software. Ultimately this means that

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple versions of a WordPress plugin by the name of "School Management Pro" harbored a backdoor that could grant an adversary complete control over vulnerable websites.  The issue, spotted in premium versions before 9.9.7, has been assigned the CVE identifier&nbsp; CVE-2022-1609 &nbsp;and is rated 10 out of 10 for severity.  The backdoor, which is believed to have existed since version 8.9, enables "an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on sites with the plugin installed," Jetpack's Harald Eilertsen&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Friday write-up.   School Management, developed by an India-based company called&nbsp; Weblizar , is billed as a Wordpress add-on to "manage complete school operation." It also claims more than 340,000 customers of its premium and free WordPress themes and plugins.  The WordPress security company noted that it uncovered the implant on May 4 after it was alerted to the presence of heavily obfuscated code in the license-checking code of t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Linux botnet malware known as XorDdos  has witnessed a 254% surge in activity over the last six months, according to latest research from Microsoft.  The trojan, so named for carrying out denial-of-service attacks on Linux systems and its use of XOR-based encryption for communications with its command-and-control (C2) server, is&nbsp; known &nbsp;to have been&nbsp; active &nbsp;since at least 2014.  "XorDdos' modular nature provides attackers with a versatile trojan capable of infecting a variety of Linux system architectures," Ratnesh Pandey, Yevgeny Kulakov, and Jonathan Bar Or of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an exhaustive deep-dive of the malware.   "Its SSH brute-force attacks are a relatively simple yet effective technique for gaining root access over a number of potential targets."  Remote control over vulnerable IoT and other internet-connected devices is gained by means of secure shell (SSH) brute-force attacks, enabling the malware to form a botnet

Microsoft Warns of "Cryware" Info-Stealing Malware Targeting Crypto Wallets<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/microsoft-warns-of-cryware-info.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning of an emerging threat targeting internet-connected cryptocurrency wallets, signaling a departure in the use of digital coins in cyberattacks.  The tech giant dubbed the new threat "cryware," with the attacks resulting in the irreversible theft of virtual currencies by means of fraudulent transfers to an adversary-controlled wallet.  "Cryware are information stealers that collect and exfiltrate data directly from non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets, also known as&nbsp; hot wallets ," Berman Enconado and Laurie Kirk of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.&nbsp;  "Because hot wallets, unlike custodial wallets, are stored locally on a device and provide easier access to cryptographic keys needed to perform transactions, more and more threats are targeting them."   Attacks of this kind are not theoretical. Earlier this year, Kaspersky&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a financially-motivated campaign staged by the North Korea-based Lazarus Gr

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new variant of the macOS malware tracked as UpdateAgent has been spotted in the wild, indicating ongoing attempts on the part of its authors to upgrade its functionalities.  "Perhaps one of the most identifiable features of the malware is that it relies on the AWS infrastructure to host its various payloads and perform its infection status updates to the server," researchers from Jamf Threat Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.   UpdateAgent, first detected in late 2020, has since&nbsp; evolved &nbsp;into a malware dropper, facilitating the distribution of second-stage payloads such as adware while also bypassing macOS&nbsp; Gatekeeper &nbsp;protections.   The newly discovered Swift-based dropper masquerades as Mach-O binaries named " PDFCreator " and " ActiveDirectory " that, upon execution, establish a connection to a remote server and retrieve a bash script to be executed.

Hackers Deploy IceApple Exploitation Framework on Hacked MS Exchange Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/hackers-deploy-iceapple-exploitation.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have detailed a previously undocumented .NET-based post-exploitation framework called IceApple that has been deployed on Microsoft Exchange server instances to facilitate reconnaissance and data exfiltration.  "Suspected to be the work of a state-nexus adversary, IceApple remains under active development, with 18 modules observed in use across a number of enterprise environments, as of May 2022," CrowdStrike&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Wednesday report.   The cybersecurity firm, which discovered the sophisticated malware in late 2021, noted its presence in multiple victim networks and in geographically distinct locations. Targeted victims span a wide range of sectors, including technology, academic, and government entities.  A post-exploitation toolset, as the name implies, is not used to provide initial access, but is rather employed to carry out follow-on attacks after having already compromised the hosts in question.   IceApple is notable for the fact that it's an in-memo

A previously undocumented remote access trojan (RAT) written in the Go programming language has been spotted disproportionately targeting entities in Italy, Spain, and the U.K.  Called&nbsp; Nerbian RAT &nbsp;by enterprise security firm Proofpoint, the novel malware leverages COVID-19-themed lures to propagate as part of a low volume email-borne phishing campaign that started on April 26, 2022.  "The newly identified Nerbian RAT leverages multiple anti-analysis components spread across several stages, including multiple open-source libraries," Proofpoint researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.&nbsp;   "It is written in operating system (OS) agnostic Go programming language, compiled for 64-bit systems, and leverages several encryption routines to further evade network analysis."

Malicious NPM Packages Target German Companies in Supply Chain Attack<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/malicious-npm-packages-target-german.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a number of malicious packages in the NPM registry specifically targeting a number of prominent media, logistics, and industrial firms based in Germany to carry out&nbsp; supply chain attacks .  "Compared with most malware found in the NPM repository, this payload seems particularly dangerous: a highly-sophisticated, obfuscated piece of malware that acts as a backdoor and allows the attacker to take total control over the infected machine," researchers from JFrog&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.  The DevOps company said that evidence points to it being either the work of a sophisticated threat actor or a "very aggressive" penetration test.   All the rogue packages, most of which have since been removed from the repository, have been traced to four "maintainers" - bertelsmannnpm, boschnodemodules, stihlnodemodules, and dbschenkernpm — indicating an attempt to impersonate legitimate firms like Bertelsmann, Bosch, Stihl, and DB Sc

Cybersecurity researchers have dissected the inner workings of an information-stealing malware called Saintstealer  that's designed to siphon credentials and system information.  "After execution, the stealer extracts username, passwords, credit card details, etc.," Cyble researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis last week. "The stealer also steals data from various locations across the system and compresses it in a password-protected ZIP file."  A 32-bit C# .NET-based executable with the name "saintgang.exe," Saintstealer is equipped with anti-analysis checks, opting to terminate itself if it's running either in a sandboxed or virtual environment.   The malware can capture a wide range of information that ranges from taking screenshots to gathering passwords, cookies, and autofill data stored in Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Opera, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, and Yandex, among others.  It can also steal Discord multi-factor authentication toke

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new set of trojanized apps spread via the Google Play Store has been observed distributing the notorious Joker malware on compromised Android devices.  Joker, a&nbsp; repeat &nbsp; offender , refers to a class of harmful apps that are used for billing and SMS fraud, while also performing a number of actions of a malicious hacker's choice, such as stealing text messages, contact lists, and device information.  Despite continued attempts on the part of Google to scale up its defenses, the apps have been continually iterated to search for gaps and slip into the app store undetected.   "They're usually spread on Google Play, where scammers download legitimate apps from the store, add malicious code to them and re-upload them to the store under a different name," Kaspersky researcher Igor Golovin&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week.  The trojanized apps, taking the place of their removed counterparts, often appear as messaging, health tracking, and PDF scanner apps that, once

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malicious campaign has been spotted taking advantage of Windows event logs to stash chunks of shellcode for the first time in the wild.  "It allows the 'fileless' last stage trojan to be hidden from plain sight in the file system," Kaspersky researcher Denis Legezo&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published this week.  The stealthy infection process, not attributed to a known actor, is believed to have commenced in September 2021 when the intended targets were lured into downloading compressed .RAR files containing Cobalt Strike and&nbsp; Silent Break .   The adversary simulation software modules are then used as a launchpad to inject code into Windows system processes or trusted applications.  Also notable is the use of anti-detection wrappers as part of the toolset, suggesting an attempt on the part of the operators to fly under the radar.   One of the key methods is to keep encrypted shellcode containing the next-stage malware as 8KB pieces in event logs, a never-b

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new Windows malware with worm-like capabilities and is propagated by means of removable USB devices.  Attributing the malware to a cluster named " Raspberry Robin ," Red Canary researchers&nbsp; noted &nbsp;that the worm "leverages Windows Installer to reach out to QNAP-associated domains and download a malicious DLL."  The earliest signs of the activity are said to date back to September 2021, with infections observed in organizations with ties to technology and manufacturing sectors.   Attack chains pertaining to Raspberry Robin start with connecting an infected USB drive to a Windows machine. Present within the device is the worm payload, which appears as a .LNK shortcut file to a legitimate folder.   The worm then takes care of spawning a new process using cmd.exe to read and execute a malicious file stored on the external drive.  This is followed by launching explorer.exe and msiexec.exe, the latter of which is used for extern

New BotenaGo Malware Variant Targeting Lilin Security Camera DVR Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/new-botenago-malware-variant-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new variant of an IoT botnet called BotenaGo has emerged in the wild, specifically singling out Lilin security camera DVR devices to infect them with Mirai malware.  Dubbed " Lilin Scanner " by Nozomi Networks, the&nbsp; latest version &nbsp;is designed to exploit a two-year-old critical&nbsp; command injection vulnerability &nbsp;in the DVR firmware that was patched by the Taiwanese company in February 2020.   BotenaGo , first documented in November 2021 by AT&amp;T Alien Labs, is written in Golang and features over 30 exploits for known vulnerabilities in web servers, routers and other kinds of IoT devices.  The botnet's source code has since been uploaded to GitHub, making it ripe for abuse by other criminal actors. "With only 2,891 lines of code, BotenaGo has the potential to be the starting point for many new variants and new malware families using its source code," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;this year.  The new BotenaGo malware is the&nbsp; latest &nbsp;to exploit vulnerabilities in Lil

A new set of phishing attacks delivering the more_eggs  malware has been observed striking corporate hiring managers with bogus resumes as an infection vector, a year after potential candidates looking for work on LinkedIn were lured with weaponized job offers .  "This year the more_eggs operation has flipped the social engineering script, targeting hiring managers with fake resumes instead of targeting jobseekers with fake job offers," eSentire's research and reporting lead, Keegan Keplinger, said in a statement .   The Canadian cybersecurity company said it identified and disrupted four separate security incidents, three of which occurred at the end of March. Targeted entities include a U.S.-based aerospace company, an accounting business located in the U.K., a law firm, and a staffing agency, both based out of Canada.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new version of the SolarMarker malware that packs in new improvements with the goal of updating its defense evasion abilities and staying under the radar.  "The recent version demonstrated an evolution from Windows Portable Executables (EXE files) to working with Windows installer package files (MSI files)," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this month. "This campaign is still in development and going back to using executables files (EXE) as it did in its earlier versions."  SolarMarker, also called Jupyter, leverages manipulated search engine optimization (SEO) tactics as its primary infection vector. It's known for its information stealing and backdoor features, enabling the attackers to steal data stored in web browsers and execute arbitrary commands retrieved from a remote server.   In February 2022, the operators of SolarMarker were&nbsp; observed &nbsp;using stealthy Windows Registry trick

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Chinese-backed Hafnium hacking group has been linked to a piece of a new malware that's used to maintain persistence on compromised Windows environments.  The threat actor is said to have targeted entities in the telecommunication, internet service provider and data services sectors from August 2021 to February 2022, expanding from the initial victimology patterns observed during its attacks exploiting the then zero-day flaws in&nbsp; Microsoft Exchange Servers &nbsp;in March 2021.  Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), which dubbed the defense evasion malware " Tarrask ," characterized it as a tool that creates "hidden" scheduled tasks on the system. "Scheduled task abuse is a very common method of persistence and defense evasion — and an enticing one, at that," the researchers&nbsp; said .

A number of rogue Android apps that have been cumulatively installed from the official Google Play Store more than 50,000 times are being used to target banks and other financial entities.  The rental banking trojan, dubbed&nbsp; Octo , is said to be a rebrand of another Android malware called ExobotCompact, which, in turn, is a "lite" replacement for its Exobot predecessor, Dutch mobile security firm ThreatFabric&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Exobot is also likely said to have paved the way for a separate descendant called Coper, that was initially&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;targeting Colombian users around July 2021, with newer infections targeting Android users in different European Countries.  "Coper malware apps are modular in design and include a multi-stage infection method and many defensive tactics to survive removal attempts," Cybersecurity company Cyble&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in an analysis of the malware last month.

First Malware Targeting AWS Lambda Serverless Platform Discovered<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/first-malware-targeting-aws-lambda.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A first-of-its-kind malware targeting Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Lambda serverless computing platform has been discovered in the wild.  Dubbed "Denonia" after the name of the domain it communicates with, "the malware uses newer address resolution techniques for command and control traffic to evade typical detection measures and virtual network access controls," Cado Labs researcher Matt Muir&nbsp; said .   The&nbsp; artifact &nbsp;analyzed by the cybersecurity company was uploaded to the VirusTotal database on February 25, 2022, sporting the name "python" and packaged as a 64-bit&nbsp; ELF &nbsp;executable.  However, the filename is a misnomer, as Denonia is programmed in Go and harbors a customized variant of the XMRig cryptocurrency mining software. That said, the mode of initial access is unknown, although it's suspected it may have involved the compromise of AWS Access and Secret Keys.   Another notable feature of the malware is its use of DNS over HTTPS ( DoH ) for c

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a "simple but efficient" persistence mechanism adopted by a relatively nascent malware loader called Colibri , which has been observed deploying a Windows information stealer known as Vidar as part of a new campaign.  "The attack starts with a malicious Word document deploying a Colibri bot that then delivers the Vidar Stealer," Malwarebytes Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis. "The document contacts a remote server at (securetunnel[.]co) to load a remote template named 'trkal0.dot' that contacts a malicious macro," the researchers added.  First documented by&nbsp; FR3D.HK &nbsp;and Indian cybersecurity company CloudSEK earlier this year, Colibri is a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platform that's engineered to drop additional payloads onto compromised systems. Early signs of the loader appeared on Russian underground forums in August 2021.  "This loader has multiple techniques that help avoid detection," CloudSEK r

Threat actors have been distributing malicious applications under the guise of seemingly harmless shopping apps to target customers of eight Malaysian banks since at least November 2021.  The attacks involved setting up fraudulent but legitimate-looking websites to trick users into downloading the apps, Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The copycat websites impersonated cleaning services such as Maid4u, Grabmaid, Maria's Cleaning, Maid4u, YourMaid, Maideasy and MaidACall and a pet store named PetsMore, all of which are aimed at users in Malaysia.   "The threat actors use these fake e-shop applications to phish for banking credentials," ESET&nbsp; said . "The apps also forward all SMS messages received by the victim to the malware operators in case they contain 2FA codes sent by the bank."

New Malware Loader 'Verblecon' Infects Hacked PCs with Cryptocurrency Miners<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/new-malware-loader-verblecon-infects.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unidentified threat actor has been observed employing a "complex and powerful" malware loader with the ultimate objective of deploying cryptocurrency miners on compromised systems and potentially facilitating the theft of Discord tokens.  "The evidence found on victim networks appears to indicate that the goal of the attacker was to install cryptocurrency mining software on victim machines," researchers from the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom Software,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.   "This would appear to be a relatively low-reward goal for the attacker given the level of effort that would have been required to develop this sophisticated malware."  This advanced piece of malware, dubbed Verblecon, is said to have been first spotted two months ago in January 2022, with the payload incorporating&nbsp; polymorphic qualities &nbsp;to evade signature-based detections by security software.  In addition, the loader carries out further a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have shed more light on a malicious loader that runs as a server and executes received modules in memory, laying bare the structure of an "advanced multi-layered virtual machine" used by the malware to fly under the radar.  Wslink, as the malicious loader is called, was first&nbsp; documented &nbsp;by Slovak cybersecurity company ESET in October 2021, with very few telemetry hits detected in the past two years spanning Central Europe, North America, and the Middle East.   Analysis of the malware samples have yielded little to no clues about the initial compromise vector used, and no code, functionality, or operational similarities have been uncovered to suggest that this is a tool from a previously identified threat actor.  Packed with a file compression utility named NsPack, Wslink makes use of what's called a&nbsp; process virtual machine &nbsp;(VM), a mechanism to run an application in a platform-independent manner that abstracts the underlying hardware or opera

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Before hunting malware, every researcher needs to find a system where to analyze it. There are several ways to do it: build your own environment or use third-party solutions. Today we will walk through all the steps of creating a custom malware sandbox where you can perform a proper analysis without infecting your computer. And then compare it with a ready-made service.  Why do you need a malware sandbox?&nbsp;  A sandbox allows detecting cyber threats and analyzing them safely. All information remains secure, and a suspicious file can't access the system. You can monitor malware processes, identify their patterns and investigate behavior.  Before setting up a sandbox, you should have a clear goal of what you want to achieve through the lab.&nbsp;  There are two ways how to organize your working space for analysis:   Custom sandbox. &nbsp;Made from scratch by an analyst on their own, specifically for their needs.

A new large scale supply chain attack has been observed targeting Azure developers with no less than 218 malicious NPM packages with the goal of stealing personal identifiable information.  "After manually inspecting some of these packages, it became apparent that this was a targeted attack against the entire&nbsp; @azure NPM scope , by an attacker that employed an automatic script to create accounts and upload malicious packages that cover the entirety of that scope," JFrog researchers Andrey Polkovnychenko and Shachar Menashe&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report.  The entire set of malicious packages was disclosed to the NPM maintainers roughly two days after they were published, leading to their quick removal, but not before each of the packages were downloaded around 50 times on average.   The attack refers to what's called typosquatting, which takes place when bad actors push rogue packages with names mimicking legitimate libraries to a public software registry such as NPM or PyPI wit

Researchers have disclosed details of a newly discovered macOS variant of a malware implant developed by a Chinese espionage threat actor known to strike attack organizations across Asia.  Attributing the attacks to a group tracked as&nbsp; Storm Cloud , cybersecurity firm Volexity characterized the new malware, dubbed&nbsp; Gimmick , a "feature-rich, multi-platform malware family that uses public cloud hosting services (such as Google Drive) for command-and-control (C2) channels."  The cybersecurity firm said it recovered the sample through memory analysis of a compromised MacBook Pro running macOS 11.6 (Big Sur) as part of an intrusion campaign that took place in late 2021.   "Storm Cloud is an advanced and versatile threat actor, adapting its tool set to match different operating systems used by its targets," Volexity researchers Damien Cash, Steven Adair, and Thomas Lancaster&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.

"The threat actor attempted to install a backdoor on a potential victim's device, which could enable remote administration, command and control (C2), data theft, or deliver other additional payloads," Proofpoint researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.   The phishing lure that triggers the infection sequence makes use of a resume-themed subject line, with the attached macro-embedded Microsoft Word document masquerading as information related to the European Union's General Data Prot

TrickBot Malware Abusing MikroTik Routers as Proxies for Command-and-Control<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/trickbot-malware-abusing-hacked-iot.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Wednesday detailed a previously undiscovered technique put to use by the TrickBot malware that involves using compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices as a go-between for establishing communications with the command-and-control (C2) servers.  "By using MikroTik routers as proxy servers for its C2 servers and redirecting the traffic through non-standard ports, TrickBot adds another persistence layer that helps malicious IPs evade detection by standard security systems," Microsoft's Defender for IoT Research Team and Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)&nbsp; said .   TrickBot, which emerged as a banking trojan in 2016, has evolved into a sophisticated and persistent threat, with its modular architecture enabling it to adapt its tactics to suit different networks, environments, and devices as well as offer access-as-a-service for next-stage payloads like Conti ransomware.  The expansion to TrickBot's capabilities comes amid reports of its&nbsp; infrastructure goin

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two weeks after details emerged about a second data wiper strain delivered in attacks against Ukraine, yet another destructive malware has been detected amid Russia's continuing military invasion of the country.  Slovak cybersecurity company ESET dubbed the third wiper " CaddyWiper ," which it said it first observed on March 14 around 9:38 a.m. UTC. Metadata associated with the executable (" caddy.exe ") shows that the malware was compiled at 7:19 a.m. UTC, a little over two hours prior to its deployment.  CaddyWiper is notable for the fact that it doesn't share any similarities with previously discovered wipers in Ukraine, including&nbsp; HermeticWiper &nbsp;(aka FoxBlade or KillDisk) and&nbsp; IsaacWiper &nbsp;(aka Lasainraw), the two of which have been deployed in systems belonging to government and commercial entities.

SharkBot Banking Malware Spreading via Fake Android Antivirus App on Google Play Store<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/sharkbot-banking-malware-spreading-via.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor behind a nascent Android banking trojan named&nbsp; SharkBot &nbsp;has managed to evade Google Play Store security barriers by masquerading as an antivirus app.  SharkBot, like its malware counterparts&nbsp; TeaBot ,&nbsp; FluBot , and&nbsp; Oscorp &nbsp;(UBEL), belongs to a category of financial trojans capable of siphoning credentials to initiate money transfers from compromised devices by circumventing multi-factor authentication mechanisms. It first emerged on the scene in November 2021.  Where SharkBot stands apart is in its ability to carry out the unauthorized transactions via Automatic Transfer Systems (ATS), which stands in contrast to TeaBot, which requires a live operator to interact with the infected devices to conduct the malicious activities.   "The ATS features allow the malware to receive a list of events to be simulated, and they will be simulated in order to do the money transfers," Alberto Segura and Rolf Govers, malware analysts at cybersecurity firm NCC Group,&nbsp; said

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Android banking trojan designed to steal credentials and SMS messages has been observed once again sneaking past Google Play Store protections to target users of more than 400 banking and financial apps, including those from Russia, China, and the U.S.  "TeaBot RAT capabilities are achieved via the device screen's live streaming (requested on-demand) plus the abuse of Accessibility Services for remote interaction and key-logging," Cleafy researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "This enables Threat Actors (TAs) to perform ATO (Account Takeover) directly from the compromised phone, also known as 'On-device fraud.'"   Also known by the name Anatsa, TeaBot first&nbsp; emerged &nbsp;in May 2021, camouflaging its malicious functions by posing as seemingly innocuous PDF document and QR code scanner apps that are distributed via the official Google Play Store instead of third-party apps stores or via fraudulent websites.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Iranian geopolitical nexus threat actor has been uncovered deploying two new targeted malware that come with "simple" backdoor functionalities as part of an intrusion against an unnamed Middle East government entity in November 2021.  Cybersecurity company Mandiant attributed the attack to an uncategorized cluster it's tracking under the moniker&nbsp; UNC3313 , which it assesses with "moderate confidence" as associated with the MuddyWater state-sponsored group.  "UNC3313 conducts surveillance and collects strategic information to support Iranian interests and decision-making," researchers Ryan Tomcik, Emiel Haeghebaert, and Tufail Ahmed&nbsp; said . "Targeting patterns and related lures demonstrate a strong focus on targets with a geopolitical nexus."   In mid-January 2022, U.S. intelligence agencies&nbsp; characterized &nbsp;MuddyWater (aka Static Kitten, Seedworm, TEMP.Zagros, or Mercury) as a subordinate element of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and

Social Media Hijacking Malware Spreading Through Gaming Apps on Microsoft Store<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/social-media-hijacking-malware.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malware capable of controlling social media accounts is being distributed through Microsoft's official app store in the form of trojanized gaming apps, infecting more than 5,000 Windows machines in Sweden, Bulgaria, Russia, Bermuda, and Spain.  Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point dubbed the malware "Electron Bot," in reference to a command-and-control (C2) domain used in recent campaigns. The identity of the attackers is not known, but evidence suggests that they could be based out of Bulgaria.  "Electron Bot is a modular SEO poisoning malware, which is used for social media promotion and click fraud," Check Point's Moshe Marelus&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published this week. "It is mainly distributed via the Microsoft store platform and dropped from dozens of infected applications, mostly games, which are constantly uploaded by the attackers."   The first sign of malicious activity commenced as an ad clicker campaign that was discovered in O

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a previously undocumented and stealthy custom malware called SockDetour  that targeted U.S.-based defense contractors with the goal of being used as a secondary implant on compromised Windows hosts.  "SockDetour is a backdoor that is designed to remain stealthily on compromised Windows servers so that it can serve as a backup backdoor in case the primary one fails," Palo Alto Networks' Unit 41 threat intelligence&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Thursday. "It is difficult to detect, since it operates filelessly and socketlessly on compromised Windows servers."  Even more concerningly, SockDetour is believed to have been used in attacks since at least July 2019, based on a compilation timestamp on the sample, implying that the backdoor successfully managed to slip past detection for over two-and-a-half years.   The attacks have been attributed to a threat cluster it tracks as&nbsp; TiltedTemple &nbsp;(aka DEV-0322 by Microsof

Cybersecurity firms ESET  and Broadcom's Symantec  said they discovered a new data wiper malware used in fresh attacks against hundreds of machines in Ukraine, as Russian forces formally launched a full-scale  military operation  against the country.  The Slovak company dubbed the wiper " HermeticWiper " (aka&nbsp; KillDisk.NCV ), with one of the malware samples compiled on December 28, 2021, implying that preparations for the attacks may have been underway for nearly two months.  "The wiper binary is signed using a code signing certificate issued to Hermetica Digital Ltd," ESET said in a series of tweets. "The wiper abuses legitimate drivers from the EaseUS Partition Master software in order to corrupt data. As a final step the wiper reboots [the] computer."   Specifically, HermeticWiper is delivered  via the benign but signed EaseUS partition management driver that then proceeds to impair the first 512 bytes, the Master Boot Record ( MBR ) for every phys

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Similarities have been unearthed between the Dridex  general-purpose malware and a little-known ransomware strain called Entropy , suggesting that the operators are continuing to rebrand their extortion operations under a different name.  "The similarities are in the software packer used to conceal the ransomware code, in the malware subroutines designed to find and obfuscate commands (API calls), and in the subroutines used to decrypt encrypted text," cybersecurity firm Sophos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The commonalities were uncovered following two unrelated incidents targeting an unnamed media company and a regional government agency. In both cases, the deployment of Entropy was preceded by infecting the target networks with Cobalt Strike Beacons and Dridex, granting the attackers remote access.  Despite consistency in some aspects of the twin attacks, they also varied significantly with regards to the initial access vector used to worm their way ins

Researchers from China's Pangu Lab have disclosed details of a "top-tier" backdoor put to use by the Equation Group , an advanced persistent threat (APT) with alleged ties to the cyber-warfare intelligence-gathering unit of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).  Dubbed " Bvp47 " owing to numerous references to the string "Bvp" and the numerical value "0x47" used in the encryption algorithm, the backdoor was extracted from Linux systems "during an in-depth forensic investigation of a host in a key domestic department" in 2013.  Pangu Lab codenamed the attacks involving the deployment of Bvp47 "Operation Telescreen," with the implant featuring an "advanced covert channel behavior based on TCP SYN packets, code obfuscation, system hiding, and self-destruction design."

Numerous Windows machines located in South Korea have been targeted by a botnet tracked as PseudoManuscrypt  since at least May 2021 by employing the same delivery tactics of another malware called CryptBot .

The notorious TrickBot malware is targeting customers of 60 financial and technology companies, including cryptocurrency firms, primarily located in the U.S., even as its operators have updated the botnet with new anti-analysis features.  "TrickBot is a sophisticated and versatile malware with more than 20 modules that can be downloaded and executed on demand," Check Point researchers Aliaksandr Trafimchuk and Raman Ladutska&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today.   In addition to being both prevalent and persistent, TrickBot has&nbsp; continually &nbsp; evolved &nbsp;its tactics to go past security and detection layers. To that end, the malware's "injectDll" web-injects module, which is responsible for stealing banking and credential data, leverages anti-deobfuscation techniques to crash the web page and thwart attempts to scrutinize the source code.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new version of the MyloBot malware has been observed to deploy malicious payloads that are being used to send sextortion emails demanding victims to pay $2,732 in digital currency.  MyloBot , first detected in 2018, is known to&nbsp; feature &nbsp;an array of sophisticated anti-debugging capabilities and propagation techniques to rope infected machines into a botnet, not to mention remove traces of other competing malware from the systems.  Chief among its methods to evade detection and stay under the radar included a delay of 14 days before accessing its command-and-control servers and the facility to execute malicious binaries directly from memory.   MyloBot also leverages a technique called&nbsp; process hollowing , wherein the attack code is injected into a suspended and hollowed process in order to circumvent process-based defenses. This is achieved by unmapping the memory allocated to the live process and replacing it with the arbitrary code to be executed, in this case a decoded resource fi

Several Malware Families Using Pay-Per-Install Service to Expand Their Targets<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/several-malware-families-using-pay-per.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A detailed examination of a Pay-per-install (PPI) malware service called PrivateLoader has revealed its crucial role in the delivery of a variety of malware such as&nbsp; SmokeLoader ,&nbsp; RedLine Stealer ,&nbsp; Vidar ,&nbsp; Raccoon , and&nbsp; GCleaner &nbsp;since at least May 2021.  Loaders are malicious programs used for loading additional executables onto the infected machine. With PPI malware services such as PrivateLoader, malware operators pay the service owners to get their payloads "installed" based on the targets provided.   "The accessibility and moderate costs allow malware operators to leverage these services as another weapon for rapid, bulk and geo-targeted malware infections," cybersecurity firm Intel 471&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report shared with The Hacker News.   PrivateLoader, written in the C++ programming language, is designed to retrieve URLs for the malicious payloads to be deployed on the infected host, with the distribution primarily relying on a network of&nbsp; bait websites

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A financially motivated campaign that targets Android devices and spreads mobile malware via SMS phishing techniques since at least 2018 has spread its tentacles to strike victims located in France and&nbsp; Germany &nbsp;for the first time.  Dubbed&nbsp; Roaming Mantis , the latest spate of activities observed in 2021 involve sending fake shipping-related texts containing a URL to a landing page from where Android users are infected with a banking trojan known as Wroba whereas iPhone users are redirected to a phishing page that masquerades as the official Apple website.   The top affected countries, based on telemetry data gathered by Kaspersky between July 2021 and January 2022, are France, Japan, India, China, Germany, and Korea.  Also tracked under the names&nbsp; MoqHao &nbsp;and XLoader (not to be confused with the info-stealer malware of the same name&nbsp; targeting Windows and macOS ), the group's activity has continued to expand geographically even as the operators broadened their attack methods to m

Medusa Android Banking Trojan Spreading Through Flubot's Attacks Network<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/medusa-android-banking-trojan-spreading.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two different Android banking Trojans, FluBot and Medusa, are relying on the same delivery vehicle as part of a simultaneous attack campaign, according to new research published by ThreatFabric.  The ongoing side-by-side infections, facilitated through the same smishing (SMS phishing) infrastructure, involved the overlapping usage of "app names, package names, and similar icons," the Dutch mobile security firm said.  Medusa, first discovered targeting Turkish financial organizations in July 2020, has undergone several iterations, chief among which is the ability to abuse accessibility permissions in Android to siphon funds from banking apps to an account controlled by the attacker.  "Medusa sports other dangerous features like keylogging, accessibility event logging, and audio and video streaming — all these capabilities provide actors with almost full access to [a] victim's device," the researchers&nbsp; said .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A politically motivated advanced persistent threat (APT) group has expanded its malware arsenal to include a new remote access trojan (RAT) in its espionage attacks aimed at Indian military and diplomatic entities.  Called&nbsp; CapraRAT &nbsp;by Trend Micro, the implant is an Android RAT that exhibits a high "degree of crossover" with another Windows malware known as CrimsonRAT that's associated with Earth Karkaddan, a threat actor that's also tracked under the monikers APT36, Operation C-Major, PROJECTM, Mythic Leopard, and Transparent Tribe.  The first concrete signs of APT36's existence&nbsp; appeared &nbsp;in&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp;as the group began distributing information-stealing malware through phishing emails with malicious PDF attachments targeting Indian military and government personnel. The group is believed to be of&nbsp; Pakistani origin &nbsp;and operational since at least 2013.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Wednesday shed light on a previously undocumented Mac trojan that it said has undergone several iterations since its first appearance in September 2020, effectively granting it an "increasing progression of sophisticated capabilities."  The company's Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team dubbed the new malware family " UpdateAgent ," charting its evolution from a barebones information stealer to a second-stage payload distributor as part of multiple attack waves observed in 2021.   "The latest campaign saw the malware installing the evasive and persistent Adload adware, but UpdateAgent's ability to gain access to a device can theoretically be further leveraged to fetch other, potentially more dangerous payloads," the researchers&nbsp; said .  The actively in-development malware is said to be propagated via drive-by downloads or advertisement pop-ups that masquerade as legitimate software like video applications and support agents

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor behind the supply chain compromise of SolarWinds has continued to expand its malware arsenal with new tools and techniques that were deployed in attacks as early as 2019, once indicative of the elusive nature of the campaigns and the adversary's ability to maintain persistent access for years.  According to cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which&nbsp; detailed the novel tactics &nbsp;adopted by the Nobelium hacking group last week, two sophisticated malware families were placed on victim systems — a Linux variant of GoldMax and a new implant dubbed TrailBlazer — long before the scale of the attacks came to light.  Nobelium, the Microsoft-assigned moniker for the&nbsp; SolarWinds intrusion &nbsp;in December 2020, is also tracked by the wider cybersecurity community under the names UNC2452 (FireEye), SolarStorm (Unit 42), StellarParticle (Crowdstrike), Dark Halo (Volexity), and Iron Ritual (Secureworks).

In a sign that threat actors continuously shift tactics and update their defensive measures, the operators of the SolarMarker information stealer and backdoor have been found leveraging stealthy Windows Registry tricks to establish long-term persistence on compromised systems.  Cybersecurity firm Sophos, which spotted the new behavior, said that the remote access implants are still being detected on targeted networks despite the campaign witnessing a decline in November 2021.  Boasting of information harvesting and backdoor capabilities, the .NET-based malware has been linked to at least three different attack waves in 2021. The first set,&nbsp; reported in April , took advantage of search engine poisoning techniques to trick business professionals into visiting sketchy Google sites that installed SolarMarker on the victim's machines.   Then in August, the malware was&nbsp; observed &nbsp;targeting healthcare and education sectors with the goal of gathering credentials and sensitive information.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A financially-motivated malware campaign has compromised over 800 WordPress websites to deliver a banking trojan dubbed Chaes  targeting Brazilian customers of Banco do Brasil, Loja Integrada, Mercado Bitcoin, Mercado Livre, and Mercado Pago.  First documented by&nbsp; Cybereason &nbsp;in November 2020, the info-stealing malware is delivered via a sophisticated infection chain that's engineered to harvest sensitive consumer information, including login credentials, credit card numbers, and other financial information.  "Chaes is characterized by the multiple-stage delivery that utilizes scripting frameworks such as JScript, Python, and NodeJS, binaries written in Delphi, and malicious Google Chrome extensions," Avast researchers Anh Ho and Igor Morgenstern&nbsp; said . "The ultimate goal of Chaes is to steal credentials stored in Chrome and intercept logins of popular banking websites in Brazil."

TrickBot Malware Using New Techniques to Evade Web Injection Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/trickbot-malware-using-new-techniques.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The cybercrime operators behind the notorious TrickBot malware have once again upped the ante by fine-tuning its techniques by adding multiple layers of defense to slip past antimalware products.  "As part of that escalation, malware injections have been fitted with added protection to keep researchers out and get through security controls," IBM Trusteer&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report. "In most cases, these extra protections have been applied to injections used in the process of online banking fraud — TrickBot's main activity since its inception after the&nbsp; Dyre Trojan 's demise."  TrickBot , which started out as a banking trojan, has evolved into a multi-purpose crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS) that's employed by a variety of actors to deliver additional payloads such as ransomware. Over 100 variations of TrickBot have been identified to date, one of which is a " Trickboot " module that can modify the UEFI firmware of a compromised device.   In the fall of 2

Mobile Banking Trojan BRATA Gains New, Dangerous Capabilities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/mobile-banking-trojan-brata-gains-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Android malware tracked as BRATA has been updated with new features that grants it the ability to track device locations and even perform a factory reset in an apparent bid to cover up fraudulent wire transfers.  The latest variants, detected late last year, are said to be distributed through a downloader to avoid being detected by security software, Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy said in a&nbsp; technical write-up . Targets include banks and financial institutions in the U.K., Poland, Italy, and Latin America.   "What makes Android RAT so interesting for attackers is its capability to operate directly on the victim devices instead of using a new device," Cleafy researchers&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in December 2021. "By doing so, Threat Actors (TAs) can drastically reduce the possibility of being flagged "as suspicious", since the device's fingerprinting is already known to the bank."

Hackers Using New Malware Packer DTPacker to Avoid Analysis, Detection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/hackers-using-new-malware-packer.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented&nbsp; malware packer &nbsp;named DTPacker has been observed distributing multiple remote access trojans (RATs) and information stealers such as Agent Tesla, Ave Maria, AsyncRAT, and FormBook to plunder information and facilitate follow-on attacks.  "The malware uses multiple obfuscation techniques to evade antivirus, sandboxing, and analysis," enterprise security company Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published Monday. "It is likely distributed on underground forums."&nbsp;   The .NET-based commodity malware has been associated with dozens of campaigns and multiple threat groups, both advanced persistent threat (APT) and cybercrime actors, since 2020, with the intrusions aimed at hundreds of customers across many sectors.  Attack chains involving the packer rely on phishing emails as an initial infection vector. The messages contain a malicious document or a compressed executable attachment, which, when opened, deploys the packer to launch the malware.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new evasive crypto wallet stealer named BHUNT  has been spotted in the wild with the goal of financial gain, adding to a list of digital currency stealing malware such as CryptBot,&nbsp; Redline Stealer , and&nbsp; WeSteal .  "BHUNT is a modular stealer written in .NET, capable of exfiltrating wallet (Exodus, Electrum, Atomic, Jaxx, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin wallets) contents, passwords stored in the browser, and passphrases captured from the clipboard," Bitdefender researcher&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report on Wednesday.  The campaign, distributed globally across Australia, Egypt, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Norway, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, and the U.S., is suspected to be delivered to compromised systems via cracked software installers.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity teams from Microsoft on Saturday disclosed they identified evidence of a new destructive malware operation targeting government, non-profit, and information technology entities in Ukraine amid brewing geopolitical tensions between the country and Russia.  "The malware is disguised as ransomware but, if activated by the attacker, would render the infected computer system inoperable," Tom Burt, corporate vice president of customer security and trust at Microsoft, said , adding the intrusions were aimed at government agencies that provide critical executive branch or emergency response functions.  Also targeted is an IT firm that "manages websites for public and private sector clients, including government agencies whose websites were recently defaced ," Burt noted.   The computing giant, which first detected the malware on January 13, attributed the attacks to an emerging threat cluster codenamed " DEV-0586 ," with no observed overlaps in tact

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new&nbsp; cross-platform backdoor &nbsp;called " SysJoker " has been observed targeting machines running Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems as part of an ongoing espionage campaign that's believed to have been initiated during the second half of 2021.  "SysJoker masquerades as a system update and generates its [command-and-control server] by decoding a string retrieved from a text file hosted on Google Drive," Intezer researchers Avigayil Mechtinger, Ryan Robinson, and Nicole Fishbein&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in a technical write-up publicizing their findings. "Based on victimology and malware's behavior, we assess that SysJoker is after specific targets."   The Israeli cybersecurity company, attributing the work to an advanced threat actor, said it first discovered evidence of the implant in December 2021 during an active attack against a Linux-based web server belonging to an unnamed educational institution.

New Trick Could Let Malware Fake iPhone Shutdown to Spy on Users Secretly<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/new-trick-could-let-malware-fake-iphone.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed a novel technique by which malware on iOS can achieve persistence on an infected device by faking its shutdown process, making it impossible to physically determine if an iPhone is off or otherwise.  The discovery — dubbed " NoReboot " — comes courtesy of mobile security firm ZecOps, which found that it's possible to block and then simulate an iOS rebooting operation, deceiving the user into believing that the phone has been powered off when, in reality, it's still running.  The San Francisco-headquartered company&nbsp; called &nbsp;it the "ultimate persistence bug […] that cannot be patched because it's not exploiting any persistence bugs at all — only playing tricks with the human mind."  NoReboot works by interfering with the routines used in iOS to shutdown and restart the device, effectively preventing them from ever happening in the first place and allowing a trojan to achieve persistence without persistence as the device is never

New Zloader Banking Malware Campaign Exploiting Microsoft Signature Verification<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/new-zloader-banking-malware-campaign.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing&nbsp; ZLoader &nbsp;malware campaign has been uncovered exploiting remote monitoring tools and a nine-year-old flaw concerning Microsoft's digital signature verification to siphon user credentials and sensitive information.  Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point Research, which has been tracking the sophisticated infection chain since November 2021, attributed it to a cybercriminal group dubbed&nbsp; Malsmoke , citing similarities with previous attacks.  "The techniques incorporated in the infection chain include the use of legitimate remote management software (RMM) to gain initial access to the target machine," Check Point's Golan Cohen said in a report  shared with The Hacker News. "The malware then exploits Microsoft's digital signature verification method to inject its payload into a signed system DLL to further evade the system's defenses."   The campaign is said to have claimed 2,170 victims across 111 countries as of January 2, 2022, with mo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously unknown rootkit has been found setting its sights on Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's Integrated Lights-Out ( iLO ) server management technology to carry out in-the-wild attacks that tamper with the firmware modules and completely wipe data off the infected systems.  The discovery, which is the first instance of real-world malware in iLO firmware, was documented by Iranian cybersecurity firm Amnpardaz this week.  "There are numerous aspects of iLO that make it an ideal utopia for malware and APT groups: Extremely high privileges (above any level of access in the operating system), very low-level access to the hardware, being totally out of the sight of the admins, and security tools, the general lack of knowledge and tools for inspecting iLO and/or protecting it, the persistence it provides for the malware to remain even after changing the operating system, and in particular being always running and never shutting down," the researchers&nbsp; said .

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple recently fixed a security vulnerability in the macOS operating system that could be potentially exploited by a threat actor to "trivially and reliably" bypass a "myriad of foundational macOS security mechanisms" and run arbitrary code.  Security researcher Patrick Wardle&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;the discovery in a series of tweets on Thursday. Tracked as CVE-2021-30853 (CVSS score: 5.5), the issue relates to a scenario where a rogue macOS app may circumvent&nbsp; Gatekeeper &nbsp;checks, which ensure that only trusted apps can be run and that they have passed an automated process called " app notarization ."  The iPhone maker, crediting Gordon Long of Box with reporting the flaw, said it&nbsp; addressed the weakness &nbsp;with improved checks as part of macOS 11.6 updates officially released on September 20, 2021.

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of an evasive malware campaign that makes use of valid code signing certificates to sneak past security defenses and stay under the radar with the goal of deploying Cobalt Strike and BitRAT payloads on compromised systems.  The binary, a loader, has been dubbed "Blister" by researchers from Elastic Security, with the malware samples having&nbsp; negligible &nbsp;to&nbsp; zero &nbsp;detections on VirusTotal. As of writing, the infection vector used to stage the attack, as well as the ultimate objectives of the intrusion, remains unknown.

The malware has been observed signed with the certificate in question dating back to September 15, 2021.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious Android app with more than 500,000 downloads from the Google Play app store has been found hosting malware that stealthily exfiltrates users' contact lists to an attacker-controlled server and signs up users to unwanted paid premium subscriptions without their knowledge.  The latest Joker malware was found in a messaging-focused app named&nbsp; Color Message &nbsp;("com.guo.smscolor.amessage"), which has since been removed from the official app marketplace. In addition, it has been observed simulating clicks in order to generate revenue from malicious ads and connecting to servers located in Russia.   Color Message "accesses users' contact list and exfiltrates it over the network [and] automatically subscribes to unwanted paid services," mobile security firm Pradeo&nbsp; noted . "To make it difficult to be removed, the application has the capability to hides it icon once installed."   "We is [sic] committed to ensuring that the app is as useful

New PseudoManuscrypt Malware Infected Over 35,000 Computers in 2021<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/new-pseudomanuscrypt-malware-infected.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Industrial and government organizations, including enterprises in the military-industrial complex and research laboratories, are the targets of a new malware botnet dubbed&nbsp; PseudoManyscrypt &nbsp;that has infected roughly 35,000 Windows computers this year alone.  The name comes from its similarities to the&nbsp; Manuscrypt &nbsp; malware , which is part of the&nbsp; Lazarus &nbsp;APT group's attack toolset, Kaspersky researchers said, characterizing the operation as a "mass-scale spyware attack campaign." The Russian cybersecurity company said it first detected the series of intrusions in June 2021.  At least 7.2% of all computers attacked by the malware are part of industrial control systems (ICS) used by organizations in engineering, building automation, energy, manufacturing, construction, utilities, and water management sectors that are located mainly in India, Vietnam, and Russia. Approximately a third (29.4%) of non-ICS computers are situated in Russia (10.1%), India (10%), and Brazil (9.

New Fileless Malware Uses Windows Registry as Storage to Evade Detection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/new-fileless-malware-uses-windows.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new JavaScript-based remote access Trojan (RAT) propagated via a social engineering campaign has been observed employing sneaky "fileless" techniques as part of its detection-evasion methods to elude discovery and analysis.  Dubbed DarkWatchman  by researchers from Prevailion's Adversarial Counterintelligence Team (PACT), the malware uses a resilient domain generation algorithm ( DGA ) to identify its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure and utilizes the Windows Registry for all of its storage operations, thereby enabling it to bypass antimalware engines.  The RAT "utilizes novel methods for fileless persistence, on-system activity, and dynamic run-time capabilities like self-updating and recompilation," researchers Matt Stafford and Sherman Smith&nbsp; said , adding it "represents an evolution in fileless malware techniques, as it uses the registry for nearly all temporary and permanent storage and therefore never writes anything to disk, allowing it to o

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Infection chains associated with the multi-purpose Qakbot malware have been broken down into "distinct building blocks," an effort that Microsoft said will help to proactively detect and block the threat in an effective manner.  The Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team&nbsp; dubbed &nbsp; Qakbot  a "customizable chameleon that adapts to suit the needs of the multiple threat actor groups that utilize it."  Qakbot &nbsp;is believed to be the creation of a financially motivated cybercriminal threat group known as&nbsp; Gold Lagoon . It is a prevalent information-stealing malware that, in recent years, has become a precursor to many critical and widespread ransomware attacks, offering a malware installation-as-a-service that enables many campaigns.   First discovered in 2007, the modular malware — like&nbsp; TrickBot &nbsp;— has&nbsp; evolved &nbsp;from its early roots as a banking trojan to become a Swiss Army knife capable of data exfiltration and acting as a delivery mechanism for the second st

New Malvertising Campaigns Spreading Backdoors, Malicious Chrome Extensions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/new-malvertising-campaigns-spreading.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A series of malicious campaigns have been leveraging fake installers of popular apps and games such as Viber, WeChat, NoxPlayer, and Battlefield as a lure to trick users into downloading a new backdoor and an undocumented malicious Google Chrome extension with the goal of stealing credentials and data stored in the compromised systems as well as maintaining persistent remote access.  Cisco Talos attributed the malware payloads to an unknown actor that goes by the alias " magnat ," noting that "these two families have been subject to constant development and improvement by their authors."  The attacks are believed to have commenced in late 2018, with intermittent activity observed towards the end of 2019 and through early 2020, followed by fresh spikes since April 2021, while mainly singling out users in Canada, followed by the U.S., Australia, Italy, Spain, and Norway.   A noteworthy aspect of the intrusions is the use of malvertising as a means to strike individua

E-commerce platforms in the U.S., Germany, and France have come under attack from a new form of malware that targets Nginx servers in an attempt to masquerade its presence and slip past detection by security solutions.  "This novel code injects itself into a host Nginx application and is nearly invisible," Sansec Threat Research team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a new report. "The parasite is used to steal data from eCommerce servers, also known as 'server-side Magecart.'"&nbsp;  A free and open-source software, Nginx is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. NginRAT, as the advanced malware is called, works by hijacking a host Nginx application to embed itself into the webserver process.   The remote access trojan itself is delivered via&nbsp; CronRAT , another piece of malware the Dutch cybersecurity firm disclosed last week as hiding its malicious payloads in cron jobs scheduled to execute on February 31st, a non-existent ca

Researches Detail 17 Malicious Frameworks Used to Attack Air-Gapped Networks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/researches-detail-17-malicious.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Four different malicious frameworks designed to attack air-gapped networks were detected in the first half of 2020 alone, bringing the total number of such toolkits to 17 and offering adversaries a pathway to cyber espionage and exfiltrate classified information.  "All frameworks are designed to perform some form of espionage, [and] all the frameworks used USB drives as the physical transmission medium to transfer data in and out of the targeted air-gapped networks," ESET researchers Alexis Dorais-Joncas and Facundo Muñoz&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a comprehensive study of the frameworks.  Air-gapping is a network security measure designed to prevent unauthorized access to systems by physically isolating them from other unsecured networks, including local area networks and the public internet. This also implies that the only way to transfer data is by connecting a physical device to it, such as USB drives or external hard disks.   Given that the mechanism is one of the most common ways&nbsp; SCAD

Researchers have unearthed a new remote access trojan (RAT) for Linux that employs a never-before-seen stealth technique that involves masking its malicious actions by scheduling them for execution on February 31st, a non-existent calendar day.  Dubbed CronRAT, the sneaky malware "enables&nbsp; server-side Magecart data theft &nbsp;which bypasses browser-based security solutions," Sansec Threat Research said. The Dutch cybersecurity firm said it found samples of the RAT on several online stores, including an unnamed country's largest outlet.   CronRAT's standout feature is its ability to leverage the&nbsp; cron &nbsp;job-scheduler utility for Unix to hide malicious payloads using task names programmed to execute on February 31st. Not only does this allow the malware to evade detection from security software, but it also enables it to launch an array of attack commands that could put Linux eCommerce servers at risk.

Threat actors have been found using a previously undocumented JavaScript malware strain that functions as a loader to distribute an array of remote access Trojans (RATs) and information stealers.  HP Threat Research dubbed the new, evasive loader "RATDispenser," with the malware responsible for deploying at least eight different malware families in 2021. Around 155 samples of this new malware have been discovered, spread across three different variants, hinting that it's under active development.   "RATDispenser is used to gain an initial foothold on a system before launching secondary malware that establishes control over the compromised device," security researcher Patrick Schläpfer&nbsp; said . "All the payloads were RATs, designed to steal information and give attackers control over victim devices."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
At least 9.3 million Android devices have been infected by a new class of malware that disguises itself as dozens of arcade, shooter, and strategy games on Huawei's AppGallery marketplace to steal device information and victims' mobile phone numbers.  The mobile campaign was disclosed by researchers from Doctor Web, who classified the trojan as " Android.Cynos.7.origin ," owing to the fact that the malware is a modified version of the Cynos malware. Of the total 190 rogue games  identified, some were designed to target Russian-speaking users, while others were aimed at Chinese or international audiences.   Once installed, the apps prompted the victims for permission to make and manage phone calls, using the access to harvest their phone numbers along with other device information such as geolocation, mobile network parameters, and system metadata.&nbsp;   "At first glance, a mobile phone number leak may seem like an insignificant problem.

More Stealthier Version of BrazKing Android Malware Spotted in the Wild<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/more-stealthier-version-of-brazking.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Banking apps from Brazil are being targeted by a more elusive and stealthier version of an Android remote access trojan (RAT) that's capable of carrying out financial fraud attacks by stealing two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and initiating rogue transactions from infected devices to transfer money from victims' accounts to an account operated by the threat actor.  IBM X-Force dubbed the revamped banking malware BrazKing , a previous version of which was referred to as&nbsp; PixStealer &nbsp;by Check Point Research. The mobile RAT was first seen around November 2018,&nbsp; according &nbsp;to ThreatFabric.  "It turns out that its developers have been working on making the malware more agile than before, moving its core overlay mechanism to pull fake overlay screens from the command-and-control (C2) server in real-time," IBM X-Force researcher Shahar Tavor&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in a technical deep dive published last week.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Weaknesses in e-commerce portals are being exploited to deploy a Linux backdoor as well as a credit card skimmer that's capable of stealing payment information from compromised websites.  "The attacker started with automated e-commerce attack probes, testing for dozens of weaknesses in common online store platforms," researchers from Sansec Threat Research&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis. "After a day and a half, the attacker found a file upload vulnerability in one of the store's plugins." The name of the affected vendor was not revealed.   The initial foothold was then leveraged to upload a malicious web shell and alter the server code to siphon customer data. Additionally, the attacker delivered a Golang-based malware called " linux_avp " that serves as a backdoor to execute commands remotely sent from a command-and-control server hosted in Beijing.   Upon execution, the program is designed to remove itself from the disk and camouflage as a " ps -ef

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have demonstrated yet another variation of the Rowhammer attack affecting all&nbsp; DRAM &nbsp;(dynamic random-access memory) chips that bypasses currently deployed mitigations, thereby effectively compromising the security of the devices.  The new technique — dubbed " Blacksmith " ( CVE-2021-42114 , CVSS score: 9.0) — is designed to trigger bit flips on target refresh rate-enabled DRAM chips with the help of novel "non-uniform and frequency-based" memory access patterns, according to a study jointly published by academics from ETH Zurich, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and Qualcomm Technologies.   Originally disclosed in 2014,&nbsp; Rowhammer &nbsp;refers to a fundamental hardware vulnerability that could be abused to alter or corrupt memory contents by taking advantage of DRAM's tightly-packed, matrix-like memory cell architecture to repeatedly access certain rows (aka "aggressors") that induces an electrical disturbance large enough to cause t

Cybersecurity researchers on Monday took the wraps off a new Android trojan that takes advantage of accessibility features on the devices to siphon credentials from banking and cryptocurrency services in Italy, the U.K., and the U.S.  Dubbed " SharkBot " by Cleafy, the malware is designed to strike a total of 27 targets — counting 22 unnamed international banks in Italy and the U.K. as well as five cryptocurrency apps in the U.S. — at least since late October 2021 and is believed to be in its early stages of development, with no overlaps found to that of any known families.   "The main goal of SharkBot is to initiate money transfers from the compromised devices via Automatic Transfer Systems (ATS) technique bypassing multi-factor authentication mechanisms (e.g., SCA)," the researchers said in a report.  "Once SharkBot is successfully installed in the victim's device, attackers can obtain sensitive banking information through the abuse of Accessibility Serv

An ongoing mobile spyware campaign has been uncovered snooping on South Korean residents using a family of 23 malicious Android apps to siphon sensitive information and gain remote control of the devices.  "With more than a thousand South Korean victims, the malicious group behind this invasive campaign has had access to all the data, communications, and services on their devices," Zimperium researcher Aazim Yaswant said. "The victims were broadcasting their private information to the malicious actors with zero indication that something was amiss."  The Dallas-based mobile security company dubbed the campaign " PhoneSpy ."   Zimperium did not attribute the spyware to a known threat actor. "The evidence surrounding PhoneSpy shows a familiar framework that has been passed around for years, updated by individuals and shared within private communities and back channels until assembled into what we see in this variation today," Richard Melick, the co

At least nine entities across the technology, defense, healthcare, energy, and education industries were compromised by leveraging a&nbsp; recently patched critical vulnerability &nbsp;in Zoho's ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus self-service password management and single sign-on (SSO) solution.  The spying campaign, which was observed starting September 22, 2021, involved the threat actor taking advantage of the flaw to gain initial access to targeted organizations, before moving laterally through the network to carry out post-exploitation activities by deploying malicious tools designed to harvest credentials and exfiltrate sensitive information via a backdoor.  "The actor heavily relies on the Godzilla web shell, uploading several variations of the open-source web shell to the compromised server over the course of the operation," researchers from Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators behind the Mekotio banking trojan have resurfaced with a shift in its infection flow so as to stay under the radar and evade security software, while staging nearly 100 attacks over the last three months.  "One of the main characteristics […] is the modular attack which gives the attackers the ability to change only a small part of the whole in order to avoid detection," researchers from Check Point Research said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The latest wave of attacks are said to primarily target victims located in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Spain.  The development comes after Spanish law enforcement agencies in July 2021&nbsp; arrested &nbsp;16 individuals belonging to a criminal network in connection with operating Mekotio and another banking malware called Grandoreiro as part of a social engineering campaign targeting financial institutions in Europe.   The evolved version of the Mekotio malware strain is designed for compromising Windows systems wit

A novel class of vulnerabilities could be leveraged by threat actors to inject visually deceptive malware in a way that's semantically permissible but alters the logic defined by the source code, effectively opening the door to more first-party and supply chain risks.  Dubbed " Trojan Source attacks ," the technique "exploits subtleties in text-encoding standards such as&nbsp; Unicode &nbsp;to produce source code whose tokens are logically encoded in a different order from the one in which they are displayed, leading to vulnerabilities that cannot be perceived directly by human code reviewers," Cambridge University researchers Nicholas Boucher and Ross Anderson said in a newly published paper.   The&nbsp; vulnerabilities &nbsp;— tracked as CVE-2021-42574 and CVE-2021-42694 — affect compilers of all popular programming languages such as C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and Python.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unidentified threat actor has been linked to a new Android malware strain that features the ability to root smartphones and take complete control over infected smartphones while simultaneously taking steps to evade detection.  The malware has been named " AbstractEmu " owing to its use of code abstraction and anti-emulation checks undertaken to thwart analysis right from the moment the apps are opened. Notably, the global mobile campaign is engineered to target and infect as many devices as possible indiscriminately.   Lookout Threat Labs said it found a total of 19 Android applications  that posed as utility apps and system tools like password managers, money managers, app launchers, and data saving apps, seven of which contained the rooting functionality. Only one of the rogue apps, called Lite Launcher, made its way to the official Google Play Store, attracting a total of 10,000 downloads before it was purged.

New Wslink Malware Loader Runs as a Server and Executes Modules in Memory<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/new-wslink-malware-loader-runs-as.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday took the wraps off a "simple yet remarkable" malware loader for malicious Windows binaries targeting Central Europe, North America and the Middle East.  Codenamed " Wslink " by ESET, this previously undocumented malware stands apart from the rest in that it runs as a server and executes received modules in memory. There are no specifics available on the initial compromise vector and there are no code or operational overlaps that tie this tool to a known threat actor group.   The Slovak cybersecurity firm noted that it has seen only a handful of detections in the past two years, suggesting that it could be used in highly-targeted cyber infiltrations.  Wslink is designed to run as a service and can accept encrypted portal executable (PE) files from a specific IP address, which is then decrypted and loaded into memory prior to the execution. To achieve this, the client (i.e., the victim) and the server perform a handshake that in

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious actors have yet again published two more typosquatted libraries to the official NPM repository that mimic a legitimate package from Roblox, the game company, with the goal of distributing stealing credentials, installing remote access trojans, and infecting the compromised systems with ransomware.  The bogus packages — named " noblox.js-proxy " and " noblox.js-proxies " — were found to impersonate a library called " noblox.js ," a Roblox game API wrapper available on NPM and boasts of nearly 20,000 weekly downloads, with each of the poisoned libraries, downloaded a total of 281 and 106 times respectively.   According to Sonatype researcher Juan Aguirre, who&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;the malicious NPM packages, the author of noblox.js-proxy first published a benign version that was later tampered with the obfuscated text, in reality, a Batch (.bat) script, in the post-installation JavaScript file.

Mozilla on Monday disclosed it blocked two malicious Firefox add-ons installed by 455,000 users that were found misusing the Proxy API to impede downloading updates to the browser.

Because Proxy API can be&nbsp; used &nbsp;to proxy web requests, an abuse of the API could enable a bad actor to control the manner Firefox browser connects to the internet effectively.  In addition to blocking the extensions to prevent installation by other users, Mozilla said it's pausing on approvals for new add-ons that use the proxy API until the fixes are broadly available. What's more, the California-based non-profit said it'd deployed a system add-on named " Proxy Failover " that ships

A newly identified rootkit has been found with a valid digital signature issued by Microsoft that's used to proxy traffic to internet addresses of interest to the attackers for over a year targeting online gamers in China.  Bucharest-headquartered cybersecurity technology company Bitdefender named the malware " FiveSys ," calling out its possible credential theft and in-game-purchase hijacking motives. The Windows maker has since revoked the signature following responsible disclosure.   "Digital signatures are a way of establishing trust," Bitdefender researchers said in a white paper, adding "a valid digital signature helps the attacker navigate around the operating system's restrictions on loading third-party modules into the kernel. Once loaded, the rootkit allows its creators to gain virtually unlimited privileges."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday took the wraps off a mass volume email attack staged by a prolific cybercriminal gang affecting a wide range of industries, with one of its region-specific operations notably targeting Germany and Austria.  Enterprise security firm Proofpoint  tied the malware campaign with high confidence to&nbsp; TA505 , which is the name assigned to the financially motivated threat group that's been active in the cybercrime business since at least 2014, and is behind the infamous Dridex banking trojan and other arsenals of malicious tools such as FlawedAmmyy, FlawedGrace, Neutrino botnet, and Locky ransomware, among others.  The attacks are said to have started as a series of low-volume email waves, delivering only several thousand messages in each phase, before ramping up in late September and as recently as October 13, resulting in tens to hundreds of thousands of emails.   "Many of the campaigns, especially the large volume ones, strongly resemble the his

Ad-Blocking Chrome Extension Caught Injecting Ads in Google Search Pages<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/ad-blocking-chrome-extension-caught.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new deceptive ad injection campaign has been found leveraging an ad blocker extension for Google Chrome and Opera web browsers to sneakily insert ads and affiliate codes on websites, according to new research from cybersecurity firm Imperva.  The findings come following the discovery of rogue domains distributing an ad injection script in late August 2021 that the researchers connected to an add-on called AllBlock. The&nbsp; extension &nbsp;has since been pulled from both the Chrome Web Store and Opera add-ons marketplaces.   While AllBlock is designed to block ads legitimately, the JavaScript code is injected into every new tab opened on the browser. It works by identifying and sending all links in a web page — typically on search engine results pages — to a remote server, which responds back with a list of websites to replace the genuine links with, leading to a scenario where upon clicking a link, the victim is redirected to a different page.

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a new campaign that likely targets entities in Southeast Asia with a previously unrecognized Linux malware that's engineered to enable remote access to its operators, in addition to amassing credentials and function as a proxy server.  The malware family, dubbed " FontOnLake " by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, is said to feature "well-designed modules" that are continuously being upgraded with new features, indicating an active development phase. Samples uploaded to VirusTotal point to the possibility that the very first intrusions utilizing this threat have been happening as early as May 2020.  Avast &nbsp;and&nbsp; Lacework Labs &nbsp;are tracking the same malware under the moniker HCRootkit.   "The sneaky nature of FontOnLake's tools in combination with advanced design and low prevalence suggest that they are used in targeted attacks," ESET researcher Vladislav Hrčka&nbsp; said .

Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday revealed details of a previously undocumented&nbsp; UEFI &nbsp;(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) bootkit that has been put to use by threat actors to backdoor Windows systems as early as 2012 by modifying a legitimate Windows Boot Manager binary to achieve persistence, once again demonstrating how technology meant to secure the environment prior to loading the operating system is increasingly becoming a "tempting target."  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET codenamed the new malware "ESPecter" for its ability to persist on the EFI System Partition ( ESP ), in addition to circumventing Microsoft Windows Driver Signature Enforcement to load its own unsigned driver that can be used to facilitate espionage activities such as document theft, keylogging, and screen monitoring by periodically capturing screenshots.

A newly discovered "aggressive" mobile campaign has infected north of 10 million users from over 70 countries via seemingly innocuous Android apps that subscribe the individuals to premium services costing €36 (~$42) per month without their knowledge.  Zimperium zLabs dubbed the malicious trojan " GriftHorse ." The money-making scheme is believed to have been under active development starting from November 2020, with victims reported across Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S.   No fewer than 200 trojan applications were used in the campaign, making it one of the most widespread scams to have been uncovered in 2021. What's more, the malicious apps catered to a varied set of categories ranging from Tools and Entertainment to Personalization, Lifestyle, and Dating, effectively widening the scale of the attacks. One of the apps, Handy Translator Pro, amassed as much as 500,000 downloads.  &amp;qu

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Commercially developed FinFisher surveillanceware has been upgraded to infect Windows devices using a&nbsp; UEFI &nbsp;(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) bootkit that leverages a trojanized Windows Boot Manager, marking a shift in infection vectors that allow it to elude discovery and analysis.  Detected in the wild since 2011, FinFisher (aka FinSpy or Wingbird) is a spyware toolset for Windows, macOS, and Linux developed by Anglo-German firm Gamma International and supplied exclusively to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But like with NSO Group's Pegasus, the software has also been used to&nbsp; spy on Bahraini activists &nbsp;in the past allegedly and delivered as part of&nbsp; spear-phishing campaigns &nbsp;in September 2017.   FinFisher is equipped to harvest user credentials, file listings, sensitive documents, record keystrokes, siphon email messages from Thunderbird, Outlook, Apple Mail, and Icedove, intercept Skype contacts, chats, calls and transferred files, and capture audio and video

A new advanced trojan sold on Russian-speaking underground forums comes with capabilities to steal users' accounts on popular online video game distribution services, including Steam, Epic Games Store, and EA Origin, underscoring a growing threat to the lucrative gaming market.

Attacks using Bloody Stealer have been uncovered so far in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region.

Microsoft on Monday revealed new malware deployed by the hacking group behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack last December to deliver additional payloads and steal sensitive information from Active Directory Federation Services ( AD FS ) servers.  The tech giant's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) codenamed the "passive and highly targeted backdoor" FoggyWeb, making it the threat actor tracked as Nobelium's latest tool in a long list of cyber weaponry such as&nbsp; Sunburst ,&nbsp; Sunspot ,&nbsp; Raindrop ,&nbsp; Teardrop ,&nbsp; GoldMax, GoldFinder, Sibot ,&nbsp; Flipflop ,&nbsp; NativeZone ,&nbsp; EnvyScout, BoomBox, and VaporRage .   "Once Nobelium obtains credentials and successfully compromises a server, the actor relies on that access to maintain persistence and deepen its infiltration using sophisticated malware and tools," MSTIC researchers&nbsp; said .

The operators behind the BlackRock mobile malware have surfaced back with a new Android banking trojan called&nbsp; ERMAC &nbsp;that targets Poland and has its roots in the infamous Cerberus malware, according to the latest research.  "The new trojan already has active distribution campaigns and is targeting 378 banking and wallet apps with overlays," ThreatFabric's CEO Cengiz Han Sahin said in an emailed statement. First campaigns involving ERMAC are believed to have begun in late August under the guise of the Google Chrome app.  Since then, the attacks have expanded to include a range of apps such as banking, media players, delivery services, government applications, and antivirus solutions like&nbsp; McAfee .   Almost fully based on the notorious banking trojan&nbsp; Cerberus , the Dutch cybersecurity firm's findings come from forum posts made by an actor named DukeEugene last month on August 17, inviting prospective customers to "rent a new android botnet with wide functionalit

The Israeli company said it's currently investigating the scale and scope of the attacks.   First&nbsp; documented &nbsp;in November 2020, Jupyter (aka Solarmarker) is likely Russian in origin and primarily targets Chromium, Firefox, and Chrome browser data, with additional capabilities that allow for full backdoor functionality, including features to siphon information and upload the details to a remote server and download and execute further payloads.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recently discovered wave of malware attacks has been spotted using a variety of tactics to enslave susceptible machines with easy-to-guess administrative credentials to co-opt them into a network with the goal of illegally mining cryptocurrency.  "The malware's primary tactic is to spread by taking advantage of vulnerable systems and weak administrative credentials. Once they've been infected, these systems are then used to mine cryptocurrency," Akamai security researcher Larry Cashdollar&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published last week.   The PHP malware — codenamed "Capoae" (short for "Сканирование," the Russian word for "Scanning") — is said to be delivered to the hosts via a backdoored addition to a WordPress plugin called "download-monitor," which gets installed after successfully brute-forcing WordPress admin credentials. The attacks also involve the deployment of a&nbsp; Golang binary &nbsp;with decryption functionality, with the obfusc

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly spotted banking trojan has been caught leveraging legitimate platforms like YouTube and Pastebin to store its encrypted, remote configuration and commandeer infected Windows systems, making it the latest to join the&nbsp; long list of malware &nbsp;targeting Latin America (LATAM) after Guildma, Javali, Melcoz, Grandoreiro, Mekotio, Casbaneiro, Amavaldo, Vadokrist, and Janeleiro.  The threat actor behind this malware family — dubbed " Numando " — is believed to have been active since at least 2018.   "[Numando brings] interesting new techniques to the pool of Latin American banking trojans' tricks, like using seemingly useless ZIP archives or bundling payloads with decoy BMP images," ESET researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical analysis published on Friday. "Geographically, it focuses almost exclusively on Brazil with rare campaigns in Mexico and Spain."  Written in Delphi, the malware comes with an array of backdoor capabilities that allow it to control compr

New Malware Targets Windows Subsystem for Linux to Evade Detection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/new-malware-targets-windows-subsystem.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A number of malicious samples have been created for the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with the goal of compromising Windows machines, highlighting a sneaky method that allows the operators to stay under the radar and thwart detection by popular anti-malware engines.  The "distinct tradecraft" marks the first instance where a threat actor has been found abusing WSL to install subsequent payloads.  "These files acted as loaders running a payload that was either embedded within the sample or retrieved from a remote server and was then injected into a running process using Windows API calls," researchers from Lumen Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published on Thursday.   Windows Subsystem for Linux, launched in August 2016, is a&nbsp; compatibility layer &nbsp;that's designed to run Linux binary executables (in ELF format) natively on the Windows platform without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup.   The earliest artifacts date back to M

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Users searching for TeamViewer remote desktop software on search engines like Google are being redirected to malicious links that drop&nbsp; ZLoader &nbsp;malware onto their systems while simultaneously embracing a stealthier infection chain that allows it to linger on infected devices and evade detection by security solutions.  "The malware is downloaded from a Google advertisement published through Google Adwords," researchers from SentinelOne&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published on Monday. "In this campaign, the attackers use an indirect way to compromise victims instead of using the classic approach of compromising the victims directly, such as by phishing."   First discovered in 2016, ZLoader (aka Silent Night and ZBot) is a&nbsp; fully-featured banking trojan &nbsp;and a fork of another banking malware called ZeuS, with newer versions implementing a VNC module that grants adversaries remote access to victim systems.

Researchers on Monday took the wraps off a newly discovered Linux and Windows re-implementation of&nbsp; Cobalt Strike Beacon &nbsp;that's actively set its sights on government, telecommunications, information technology, and financial institutions in the wild.  The as-yet undetected version of the penetration testing tool — codenamed "Vermilion Strike" — marks one of the&nbsp; rare Linux ports , which has been traditionally a Windows-based red team tool heavily repurposed by adversaries to mount an array of targeted attacks. Cobalt Strike bills itself as a " threat emulation software ," with Beacon being the payload engineered to model an advanced actor and duplicate their post-exploitation actions.   "The stealthy sample uses Cobalt Strike's command-and-control (C2) protocol when communicating to the C2 server and has remote access capabilities such as uploading files, running shell commands and writing to files," Intezer researchers said in a report  publishe

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented backdoor that was recently found targeting an unnamed computer retail company based in the U.S. has been linked to a longstanding Chinese espionage operation dubbed Grayfly.  In late August, Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;details of an implant called SideWalk, which is designed to load arbitrary plugins sent from an attacker-controlled server, gather information about running processes in the compromised systems, and transmit the results back to the remote server.  The cybersecurity firm attributed the intrusion to a group it tracks as SparklingGoblin, an adversary believed to be connected to the Winnti (aka APT41) malware family.   But latest research published by researchers from Broadcom's Symantec has pinned the SideWalk backdoor on the China-linked espionage group, pointing out the malware's overlaps with the older Crosswalk malware, with the latest Grayfly hacking activities singling out a number of organizations in Mexico, Taiwan

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details about a new malware family that relies on the Common Log File System ( CLFS ) to hide a second-stage payload in registry transaction files in an attempt to evade detection mechanisms.  FireEye's Mandiant Advanced Practices team, which made the discovery, dubbed the malware PRIVATELOG , and its installer, STASHLOG . Specifics about the identities of the threat actor or their motives remain unclear.  Although the malware is yet to be detected in real-world attacks aimed at customer environments or be spotted launching any second-stage payloads, Mandiant suspects that PRIVATELOG could still be in development, the work of a researcher, or deployed as part of a highly targeted activity.   CLFS is a general-purpose logging subsystem in Windows that's accessible to both kernel-mode as well as user-mode applications such as database systems, OLTP systems, messaging clients, and network event management systems for building and sharing h

New SideWalk Backdoor Targets U.S.-based Computer Retail Business<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/new-sidewalk-backdoor-targets-us-based.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A computer retail company based in the U.S. was the target of a previously undiscovered implant called SideWalk  as part of a recent campaign undertaken by a Chinese advanced persistent threat group primarily known for singling out entities in East and Southeast Asia.  Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET attributed the malware to an advanced persistent threat it tracks under the moniker SparklingGoblin, an adversary believed to be connected to the Winnti umbrella group, noting its similarities to another backdoor dubbed&nbsp; Crosswalk &nbsp;that was put to use by the same threat actor in 2019.   "SideWalk is a modular backdoor that can dynamically load additional modules sent from its C&amp;C [command-and-control] server, makes use of Google Docs as a&nbsp; dead drop resolver , and&nbsp; Cloudflare workers &nbsp;as a C&amp;C server," ESET researchers Thibaut Passilly and Mathieu Tartare&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A modified version of the WhatsApp messaging app for Android has been trojanized to serve malicious payloads, display full-screen ads, and sign up device owners for unwanted premium subscriptions without their knowledge.  "The Trojan Triada snuck into one of these modified versions of the messenger called FMWhatsApp 16.80.0 together with the advertising software development kit (SDK)," researchers from Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published Tuesday. "This is similar to&nbsp; what happened with APKPure , where the only malicious code that was embedded in the app was a payload downloader."   Modified versions of legitimate Android apps — aka Modding — are designed to perform functions not originally conceived or intended by the app developers, and FMWhatsApp allows users to customize the app with different themes, personalize icons, and hide features like last seen, and even deactivate video calling features.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
ShadowPad, an infamous Windows backdoor that allows attackers to download further malicious modules or steal data, has been put to use by five different Chinese threat clusters since 2017.  "The adoption of ShadowPad significantly reduces the costs of development and maintenance for threat actors," SentinelOne researchers Yi-Jhen Hsieh and Joey Chen&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a detailed overview of the malware, adding "some threat groups stopped developing their own backdoors after they gained access to ShadowPad."  The American cybersecurity firm dubbed ShadowPad a "masterpiece of privately sold malware in Chinese espionage."   A successor to PlugX and a modular malware platform since 2015,&nbsp; ShadowPad &nbsp;catapulted to widespread attention in the wake of supply chain incidents targeting&nbsp; NetSarang ,&nbsp; CCleaner , and&nbsp; ASUS , leading the operators to shift tactics and update their defensive measures with advanced anti-detection and persistence techniques.

NK Hackers Deploy Browser Exploits on South Korean Sites to Spread Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/nk-hackers-deploy-browser-exploit-on.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A North Korean threat actor has been discovered taking advantage of two exploits in Internet Explorer to infect victims with a custom implant as part of a strategic web compromise (SWC) targeting a South Korean online newspaper.  Cybersecurity firm Volexity&nbsp; attributed &nbsp;the attacks to a threat actor it tracks as InkySquid, and more widely known by the monikers ScarCruft and APT37. Daily NK, the publication in question, is said to have hosted the malicious code from at least late March 2021 until early June 2021.  The "clever disguise of exploit code amongst legitimate code" and the use of custom malware enables the attackers to avoid detection, Volexity researchers said.   The attacks involved tampering with the jQuery JavaScript libraries hosted on the website to serve additional obfuscated JavaScript code from a remote URL, using it to leverage exploits for two Internet Explorer flaws that were patched by Microsoft in&nbsp; August 2020 &nbsp;and&nbsp; March 2021 .

A new social engineering-based malvertising campaign targeting Japan has been found to deliver a malicious application that deploys a banking trojan on compromised Windows machines to steal credentials associated with cryptocurrency accounts.  The application masquerades as an animated porn game, a reward points application, or a video streaming application, Trend Micro researchers Jaromir Horejsi and Joseph C Chen&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week, attributing the operation to a threat actor it tracks as Water Kappa, which was&nbsp; previously found &nbsp;targeting Japanese online banking users with the Cinobi trojan by leveraging exploits in Internet Explorer browser.   The switch in tactics is an indicator that the adversary is singling out users of web browsers other than Internet Explorer, the researchers added.

New AdLoad Variant Bypasses Apple's Security Defenses to Target macOS Systems<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/new-adload-variant-bypasses-apples.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new wave of attacks involving a notorious macOS adware family has evolved to leverage around 150 unique samples in the wild in 2021 alone, some of which have slipped past Apple's on-device malware scanner and even signed by its own notarization service, highlighting the malicious software ongoing attempts to adapt and evade detection.  "AdLoad," as the malware is known, is one of several widespread adware and bundleware loaders targeting macOS since at least 2017. It's capable of backdooring an affected system to download and install adware or potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), as well as amass and transmit information about victim machines.   The new iteration "continues to impact Mac users who rely solely on Apple's built-in security control XProtect for malware detection," SentinelOne threat researcher Phil Stokes&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. "As of today, however, XProtect arguably has around 11 different signatures for AdLoa

Dubbed " Ficker Stealer ," it's notable for being propagated via Trojanized web links and compromised websites, luring in victims to scam landing pages purportedly offering free downloads of&nbsp; legitimate paid services &nbsp;like Spotify Music, YouTube Premium, and other Microsoft Store applications.   "Ficker is sold and distributed as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS), via underground Russian online forums," BlackBerry's research and intelligence team said in a report published today. "Its creator, whose alias is @ficker, offers several paid packages, with different levels of subscription fees to use their malicious program."  First seen in the wi

A new Android trojan has been found to compromise Facebook accounts of over 10,000 users in at least 144 countries since March 2021 via fraudulent apps distributed through Google Play Store and other third-party app marketplaces.  Dubbed " FlyTrap ," the previously undocumented malware is believed to be part of a family of trojans that employ social engineering tricks to breach Facebook accounts as part of a session hijacking campaign orchestrated by malicious actors operating out of Vietnam, according to a&nbsp; report &nbsp;published by Zimperium's zLabs today and shared with The Hacker News.    Although the offending nine applications have since been pulled from Google Play, they continue to be available in third-party app stores, "highlighting the risk of sideloaded applications to mobile endpoints and user data," Zimperium malware researcher Aazim Yaswant said.

A systematic analysis of attacks against Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) servers has revealed as many as 14 malware families, 10 of them newly documented, indicating that the Windows-based web server software continues to be a hotbed for&nbsp; natively developed malware &nbsp;for close to eight years.  The findings were presented today by ESET malware researcher Zuzana Hromcova at the&nbsp; Black Hat USA security conference .  "The various kinds of native IIS malware identified are server-side malware and the two things it can do best is, first, see and intercept all communications to the server, and second, affect how the requests are processed," Hromcova told in an interview with The Hacker News. "Their motivations range from cybercrime to espionage, and a technique called SEO fraud."   IIS is an extensible web server software developed by Microsoft, enabling developers to take advantage of its modular architecture and use additional IIS modules to expand on

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Healthcare and education sectors are the frequent targets of a new surge in credential harvesting activity from what's a "highly modular" .NET-based information stealer and keylogger, charting the course for the threat actor's continued evolution while simultaneously remaining under the radar.  Dubbed " Solarmarker ," the malware campaign is believed to be active since September 2020, with telemetry data pointing to malicious actions as early as April 2020, according to Cisco Talos. "At its core, the Solarmarker campaign appears to be conducted by a fairly sophisticated actor largely focused on credential and residual information theft," Talos researchers Andrew Windsor and Chris Neal&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published last week.   Infections consist of multiple moving parts, chief among them being a .NET assembly module that serves as a system profiler and staging ground on the victim host for command-and-control (C2) communications and fur

Cybersecurity researchers on Friday unmasked new command-and-control (C2) infrastructure belonging to the Russian threat actor tracked as APT29, aka Cozy Bear, that has been spotted actively serving WellMess malware as part of an ongoing attack campaign.  More than 30 C2 servers operated by the Russian foreign intelligence have been uncovered, Microsoft-owned cybersecurity subsidiary RiskIQ&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  APT29, the moniker assigned to government operatives working for Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), is believed to have been the&nbsp; mastermind behind the massive SolarWinds supply chain attack &nbsp;that came to light late last year, with the U.K. and U.S. governments formally pinning the intrusions on Russia earlier this April.

As many as eight Python packages that were downloaded more than 30,000 times have been removed from the PyPI portal for containing malicious code, once again highlighting how software package repositories are evolving into a popular target for supply chain attacks.  "Lack of moderation and automated security controls in public software repositories allow even inexperienced attackers to use them as a platform to spread malware, whether through typosquatting, dependency confusion, or simple social engineering attacks," JFrog researchers Andrey Polkovnichenko, Omer Kaspi, and Shachar Menashe&nbsp; said &nbsp;Thursday.   PyPI, short for Python Package Index, is the official third-party software repository for Python, with package manager utilities like&nbsp; pip &nbsp;relying on it as the default source for packages and their dependencies.

A cyber attack that derailed websites of Iran's transport ministry and its national railway system earlier this month, causing widespread disruptions in train services, was the result of a never-before-seen reusable wiper malware called "Meteor."  The campaign — dubbed " MeteorExpress " — has not been linked to any previously identified threat group or to additional attacks, making it the first incident involving the deployment of this malware, according to researchers from Iranian antivirus firm&nbsp; Amn Pardaz &nbsp;and SentinelOne. Meteor is believed to have been in the works over the past three years.  "Despite a lack of specific indicators of compromise, we were able to recover most of the attack components," SentinelOne's Principal Threat Researcher, Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, noted.

An Android malware that was observed abusing accessibility services in the device to hijack user credentials from European banking applications has morphed into an entirely new botnet as part of a renewed campaign that began in May 2021.  Italy's CERT-AGID, in late January, disclosed details about&nbsp; Oscorp , a mobile malware developed to attack multiple financial targets with the goal of stealing funds from unsuspecting victims. Its features include the ability to intercept SMS messages and make phone calls and perform Overlay Attacks for more than 150 mobile applications by making use of lookalike login screens to siphon valuable data.   The malware was distributed through malicious SMS messages, with the attacks often conducted in real-time by posing as bank operators to dupe targets over the phone and surreptitiously gain access to the infected device via WebRTC protocol and ultimately conduct unauthorized bank transfers. While no new activities were reported since then, it appe

Hackers Turning to 'Exotic' Programming Languages for Malware Development<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/hackers-turning-to-exotic-programming.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are increasingly shifting to "exotic" programming languages such as Go, Rust, Nim, and Dlang that can better circumvent conventional security protections, evade analysis, and hamper reverse engineering efforts.  "Malware authors are known for their ability to adapt and modify their skills and behaviors to take advantage of newer technologies,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Eric Milam, Vice President of threat research at BlackBerry. "That tactic has multiple benefits from the development cycle and inherent lack of coverage from protective products."  On the one hand, languages like Rust are more secure as they offer guarantees like&nbsp; memory-safe programming , but they can also be a double-edged sword when malware engineers abuse the same features designed to offer increased safeguards to their advantage, thereby making malware less susceptible to exploitation and thwart attempts to&nbsp; activate a kill-switch &nbsp;and render them powerless.   Noting that binaries written i

An infamous cross-platform crypto-mining malware has continued to refine and improve upon its techniques to strike both Windows and Linux operating systems by setting its sights on older vulnerabilities, while simultaneously latching on to a variety of spreading mechanisms to maximize the effectiveness of its campaigns.  "LemonDuck, an actively updated and robust malware that's primarily known for its botnet and cryptocurrency mining objectives, followed the same trajectory when it adopted more sophisticated behavior and escalated its operations," Microsoft&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published last week. "Today, beyond using resources for its traditional bot and mining activities, LemonDuck steals credentials, removes security controls, spreads via emails, moves laterally, and ultimately drops more tools for human-operated activity."   The malware is notorious for its ability to propagate rapidly across an infected network to facilitate information theft an

A malware known for targeting macOS operating system has been updated once again to add more features to its toolset that allows it to amass and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in a variety of apps, including apps such as Google Chrome and Telegram, as part of further "refinements in its tactics."  XCSSET was&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;in August 2020, when it was found targeting Mac developers using an unusual means of distribution that involved injecting a malicious payload into Xcode IDE projects that's executed at the time of building project files in Xcode.   The malware comes with numerous capabilities, such as reading and dumping Safari cookies, injecting malicious JavaScript code into various websites, stealing information from applications, such as Notes, WeChat, Skype, Telegram, and encrypting user files.  Earlier this April, XCSSET&nbsp; received an upgrade &nbsp;that enabled the malware authors to target macOS 11 Big Sur as well as Macs running on M1 chipset by circumventing new secu

Cybersecurity researchers have opened the lid on the continued resurgence of the insidious TrickBot malware , making it clear that the Russia-based transnational cybercrime group is working behind the scenes to revamp its attack infrastructure in response to recent counter efforts from law enforcement.  "The new capabilities discovered are used to monitor and gather intelligence on victims, using a custom communication protocol to hide data transmissions between [command-and-control] servers and victims — making attacks difficult to spot," Bitdefender&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published Monday, suggesting an increase in sophistication of the group's tactics.  "Trickbot shows no sign of slowing down," the researchers noted.   Botnets are formed when hundreds or thousands of hacked devices are enlisted into a network run by criminal operators, which are often then used to launch denial-of-network attacks to pummel businesses and critical infrastructure with

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are warning about a new malware that's striking online gambling companies in China via a watering hole attack to deploy either Cobalt Strike beacons or a previously undocumented Python-based backdoor called BIOPASS RAT  that takes advantage of Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) Studio's live-streaming app to capture the screen of its victims to attackers.  The attack involves deceiving gaming website visitors into downloading a malware loader camouflaged as a legitimate installer for popular-but-deprecated apps such as Adobe Flash Player or Microsoft Silverlight, only for the loader to act as a conduit for fetching next-stage payloads.  Specifically, the websites' online support chat pages are booby-trapped with malicious JavaScript code, which is used to deliver the malware to the victims.   "BIOPASS RAT possesses basic features found in other malware, such as file system assessment, remote desktop access, file exfiltration, and shell command e

Google intervened to remove nine Android apps downloaded more than 5.8 million times from the company's Play Store after the apps were caught furtively stealing users' Facebook login credentials.  "The applications were fully functional, which was supposed to weaken the vigilance of potential victims. With that, to access all of the apps' functions and, allegedly, to disable in-app ads, users were prompted to log into their Facebook accounts," researchers from Dr. Web&nbsp; said . "The advertisements inside some of the apps were indeed present, and this maneuver was intended to further encourage Android device owners to perform the required actions."   The offending apps masked their malicious intent by disguising as photo-editing, rubbish cleaner, fitness, and astrology programs, only to trick victims into logging into their Facebook account and hijack the entered credentials via a piece of JavaScript code received from an adversary-controlled server.

A previously undocumented Windows malware has infected over 222,000 systems worldwide since at least June 2018, yielding its developer no less than 9,000 Moneros ($2 million) in illegal profits.  Dubbed " Crackonosh ," the malware is distributed via illegal, cracked copies of popular software, only to disable antivirus programs installed in the machine and install a coin miner package called XMRig for stealthily exploiting the infected host's resources to mine Monero.  At least 30 different versions of the malware executable have been discovered between Jan. 1, 2018, and Nov. 23, 2020, Czech cybersecurity software company Avast&nbsp; said &nbsp;on Thursday, with a majority of the victims located in the U.S., Brazil, India, Poland, and the Philippines.

Researchers Uncover 'Process Ghosting' — A New Malware Evasion Technique<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/researchers-uncover-process-ghosting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new executable image tampering attack dubbed "Process Ghosting" that could be potentially abused by an attacker to circumvent protections and stealthily run malicious code on a Windows system.  "With this technique, an attacker can write a piece of malware to disk in such a way that it's difficult to scan or delete it — and where it then executes the deleted malware as though it were a regular file on disk," Elastic Security researcher Gabriel Landau&nbsp; said . "This technique does not involve code injection, Process Hollowing, or Transactional NTFS (TxF)."   Process Ghosting expands on previously documented&nbsp; endpoint bypass &nbsp;methods such as&nbsp; Process Doppelgänging &nbsp;and&nbsp; Process Herpaderping , thereby enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade anti-malware defenses and detection.  Process Doppelgänging, analogous to&nbsp; Process Hollowing , involves injecting arbitrary code in the address space of

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have discovered the first known malware, dubbed " Siloscope ," targeting Windows Server containers to infect Kubernetes clusters in cloud environments.  "Siloscape is heavily obfuscated malware targeting Kubernetes clusters through Windows containers,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Unit 42 researcher Daniel Prizmant. "Its main purpose is to open a backdoor into poorly configured Kubernetes clusters in order to run malicious containers such as, but not limited to, cryptojackers."   Siloscape, first detected in March 2021, is characterized by several techniques, including targeting common cloud applications such as web servers to gain an initial foothold via known vulnerabilities, following which it leverages Windows container escape techniques to break out of the confines of the container and gain remote code execution on the underlying node.  A container is an&nbsp; isolated, lightweight silo &nbsp;for running an application on the host operating system. The malware&amp;

New upgrades have been made to a Python-based "self-replicating, polymorphic bot" called Necro in what's seen as an attempt to improve its chances of infecting vulnerable systems and evading detection.  "Although the bot was originally discovered earlier this year, the latest activity shows numerous changes to the bot, ranging from different command-and-control (C2) communications and the addition of new exploits for spreading, most notably vulnerabilities in VMWare vSphere, SCO OpenServer, Vesta Control Panel and SMB-based exploits that were not present in the earlier iterations of the code," researchers from Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep-dive published today.   Said to be in development as far back as 2015,&nbsp; Necro &nbsp;(aka N3Cr0m0rPh) targets both Linux and Windows devices, with heightened activity observed at the start of the year as part of a malware campaign dubbed " FreakOut " that was found exploiting&nbsp; vulnerabilities &nbsp;in network-attached storage (

Researchers have disclosed significant security weaknesses in popular software applications that could be abused to deactivate their protections and take control of allow-listed applications to perform nefarious operations on behalf of the malware to defeat anti-ransomware defenses.  The twin attacks,&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;by academics from the University of Luxembourg and the University of London, are aimed at circumventing the protected folder feature offered by antivirus programs to encrypt files (aka "Cut-and-Mouse") and disabling their real-time protection by simulating mouse "click" events (aka "Ghost Control").

Researchers on Tuesday disclosed a new espionage campaign that resorts to destructive data-wiping attacks targeting Israeli entities at least since December 2020 that camouflage the malicious activity as ransomware extortions.  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne attributed the attacks to a nation-state actor affiliated with Iran it tracks under the moniker "Agrius."

"The operators behind the attacks intentionally masked their activity as ransomware attacks, an uncommon behavior for financially motivated groups."   The group's modus operandi involves deploying a custom .NET malware called Apostle that has evolved to become fully functional ransomware, supplanting its prior wiper capabilities, while some of the attacks have been carried out using a second

Microsoft Warns of Data Stealing Malware That Pretends to Be Ransomware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/microsoft-warns-of-data-stealing.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Thursday warned of a "massive email campaign" that's pushing a Java-based STRRAT malware to steal confidential data from infected systems while disguising itself as a ransomware infection.  "This RAT is infamous for its ransomware-like behavior of appending the file name extension .crimson to files without actually encrypting them," the Microsoft Security Intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets.  The new wave of attacks, which the company spotted last week, commences with spam emails sent from compromised email accounts with "Outgoing Payments" in the subject line, luring the recipients into opening malicious PDF documents that claim to be remittances, but in reality, connect to a rogue domain to download the STRRAT malware.   Besides establishing connections to a command-and-control server during execution, the malware comes with a range of features that allow it to collect browser passwords, log keystrokes, and run remote command

Experts Warn About Ongoing AutoHotkey-Based Malware Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/experts-warn-about-ongoing-autohotkey.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered an ongoing malware campaign that heavily relies on AutoHotkey (AHK) scripting language to deliver multiple remote access trojans (RAT) such as Revenge RAT, LimeRAT, AsyncRAT, Houdini, and Vjw0rm on target Windows systems.  At least four different versions of the campaign have been spotted starting February 2021, according to researchers from Morphisec Labs.  "The RAT delivery campaign starts from an AutoHotKey (AHK) compiled script," the researchers&nbsp; noted . "This is a standalone executable that contains the following: the AHK interpreter, the AHK script, and any files it has incorporated via the&nbsp; FileInstall &nbsp;command. In this campaign, the attackers incorporate malicious scripts/executables alongside a legitimate application to disguise their intentions."   AutoHotkey is an open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows that's meant to provide easy hotkeys for macro-creation and software automation, enablin

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are abusing Microsoft Build Engine (MSBuild) to filelessly deliver remote access trojans and password-stealing malware on targeted Windows systems.  The actively ongoing campaign is said to have emerged last month, researchers from cybersecurity firm Anomali&nbsp; said &nbsp;on Thursday, adding the malicious build files came embedded with encoded executables and shellcode that deploy&nbsp; backdoors , allowing the adversaries to take control of the victims' machines and steal sensitive information.  MSBuild is an open-source build tool for .NET and Visual Studio developed by Microsoft that allows for compiling source code, packaging, testing, deploying applications.   In using MSBuild to filelessly compromise a machine, the idea is to stay under the radar and thwart detection, as such malware makes use of a legitimate application to load the attack code into memory, thereby leaving no traces of infection on the system and giving attackers a high level of stealth.

Experts warn of a new Android banking trojan stealing users' credentials<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/experts-warn-of-new-android-banking.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Monday disclosed a new Android trojan that hijacks users' credentials and SMS messages to facilitate fraudulent activities against banks in Spain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands.  Called " TeaBot " (or Anatsa), the malware is said to be in its early stages of development, with malicious attacks targeting financial apps commencing in late March 2021, followed by a rash of infections in the first week of May against Belgium and Netherlands banks. The first signs of TeaBot activity emerged in January.   "The main goal of TeaBot is stealing victim's credentials and SMS messages for enabling frauds scenarios against a predefined list of banks," Italian cybersecurity, and online fraud prevention firm Cleafy said in a Monday write-up. "Once TeaBot is successfully installed in the victim's device, attackers can obtain a live streaming of the device screen (on demand) and also interact with it via Accessibility Ser

An unknown threat actor with the capabilities to evolve and tailor its toolset to target environments infiltrated high-profile organizations in Asia and Africa with an evasive Windows rootkit since at least 2018.  Called&nbsp; 'Moriya ,' the malware is a "passive backdoor which allows attackers to inspect all incoming traffic to the infected machine, filter out packets that are marked as designated for the malware and respond to them," said Kaspersky researchers Mark Lechtik and Giampaolo Dedola in a Thursday deep-dive.  The Russian cybersecurity firm termed the ongoing espionage campaign&nbsp; 'TunnelSnake .' Based on telemetry analysis, less than 10 victims around the world have been targeted to date, with the most prominent victims being two large diplomatic entities in Southeast Asia and Africa. All the other victims were located in South Asia.   The first reports of Moriya emerged last November when Kaspersky said it discovered the stealthy implant in the networks

Researchers on Tuesday disclosed a novel malware that uses a variety of tricks to stay under the radar and evade detection, while stealthily capable of executing arbitrary commands on infected systems.  Called 'Pingback,' the Windows malware leverages Internet Control Message Protocol ( ICMP ) tunneling for covert bot communications, allowing the adversary to utilize ICMP packets to piggyback attack code, according to an analysis  published today by Trustwave.   Pingback (" oci.dll ") achieves this by getting loaded through a legitimate service called&nbsp; MSDTC &nbsp;(Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator) — a component responsible for handling database operations that are distributed over multiple machines — by taking advantage of a method called&nbsp; DLL search order hijacking , which involves using a genuine application to preload a malicious DLL file.

"The new Buer variant is written in Rust, an efficient and easy-to-use programming language that is becoming increasingly popular," Proofpoint researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Linux malware with backdoor capabilities has managed to stay under the radar for about three years, allowing the threat actor behind the operation to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive information from infected systems.  Dubbed " RotaJakiro " by researchers from Qihoo 360 NETLAB, the backdoor targets Linux X64 machines, and is so named after the fact that "the family uses rotate encryption and behaves differently for root/non-root accounts when executing."   The findings come from an analysis of a&nbsp; malware sample &nbsp;it detected on March 25, although early versions appear to have been uploaded to VirusTotal as early as May 2018. A&nbsp; total &nbsp;of&nbsp; four &nbsp; samples &nbsp;have been found to date on the database, all of which remain undetected by most anti-malware engines. As of writing, only seven security vendors flag the latest version of the malware as malicious.   "At the functional level, RotaJakiro first determines whether the user is root or non-

Attention! FluBot Android Banking Malware Spreads Quickly Across Europe<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/attention-flubot-android-banking.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Attention, Android users! A banking malware capable of stealing sensitive information is "spreading rapidly" across Europe, with the U.S. likely to be the next target.  According to a new analysis by&nbsp; Proofpoint , the threat actors behind FluBot (aka&nbsp; Cabassous ) have branched out beyond Spain to target the U.K., Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Poland. The English-language campaign alone has been observed to make use of more than 700 unique domains, infecting about 7,000 devices in the U.K.  In addition, German and English-language SMS messages were found being sent to U.S. users from Europe, which Proofpoint suspects could be the result of malware propagating via contact lists stored on compromised phones. A concerted campaign aimed at the U.S. is yet to be detected.   FluBot, a nascent entry in the banking trojan landscape, began its operations late last year, with campaigns leveraging the malware infecting more than 60,000 users in Spain, according to an analysis published b

Researchers from the University of Minnesota apologized to the maintainers of Linux Kernel Project on Saturday for intentionally including vulnerabilities in the project's code, which led to the school being banned from contributing to the open-source project in the future.  "While our goal was to improve the security of Linux, we now understand that it was hurtful to the community to make it a subject of our research, and to waste its effort reviewing these patches without its knowledge or permission," assistant professor Kangjie Lu, along with graduate students Qiushi Wu and Aditya Pakki,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an email.  "We did that because we knew we could not ask the maintainers of Linux for permission, or they would be on the lookout for the hypocrite patches," they added.   The apology comes over a study into what's called "hypocrite commits," which was&nbsp; published &nbsp;earlier this February.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Emotet, the notorious email-based Windows malware behind several botnet-driven spam campaigns and ransomware attacks, was automatically wiped from infected computers en masse following a European law enforcement operation.  The development comes three months after a coordinated disruption of Emotet as part of " Operation Ladybird " to seize control of servers used to run and maintain the malware network. The orchestrated effort saw at least 700 servers associated with the botnet's infrastructure neutered from the inside, thus preventing further exploitation.  Law enforcement authorities from the Netherlands, Germany, the U.S., U.K., France, Lithuania, Canada, and Ukraine were involved in the international action.   Previously, the Dutch police, which seized two central servers located in the country, said it had deployed a software update to counter the threat posed by Emotet effectively. "All infected computer systems will automatically retrieve the update there, a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Facebook on Wednesday said it took steps to dismantle malicious activities perpetrated by two state-sponsored hacking groups operating out of Palestine that abused its platform to distribute malware.  The social media giant attributed the attacks to a network connected to the Preventive Security Service ( PSS ), the security apparatus of the State of Palestine, and another threat actor known as Arid Viper (aka Desert Falcon and APT-C-23), the latter of which is alleged to be connected to the cyber arm of Hamas.  The two digital espionage campaigns, active in 2019 and 2020, exploited a range of devices and platforms, such as Android, iOS, and Windows, with the PSS cluster primarily targeting domestic audiences in Palestine. The other set of attacks went after users in the Palestinian territories and Syria and, to a lesser extent Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, and Libya.   Both the groups appear to have leveraged the platform as a springboard to launch a variety of social engineering attacks in

Researchers have uncovered a new set of fraudulent Android apps in the Google Play store that were found to hijack SMS message notifications for carrying out billing fraud.  The apps in question primarily targeted users in Southwest Asia and the Arabian Peninsula, attracting a total of 700,000 downloads before they were discovered and removed from the platform.  The findings were reported independently by cybersecurity firms&nbsp; Trend Micro &nbsp;and&nbsp; McAfee .   "Posing as photo editors, wallpapers, puzzles, keyboard skins, and other camera-related apps, the malware embedded in these fraudulent apps hijack SMS message notifications and then make unauthorized purchases," researchers from McAfee said in a Monday write-up.  The fraudulent apps belong to the so-called " Joker " (aka Bread) malware, which has been found to repeatedly sneak past Google Play defenses over the past four years, resulting in Google removing no fewer than 1,700 infected apps from the Play Store as of

Malware That Spreads Via Xcode Projects Now Targeting Apple's M1-based Macs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/malware-spreads-via-xcode-projects-now.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Mac malware campaign targeting Xcode developers has been retooled to add support for Apple's new M1 chips and expand its features to steal confidential information from cryptocurrency apps.  XCSSET came into the spotlight in&nbsp; August 2020 &nbsp;after it was found to spread via modified Xcode IDE projects, which, upon the building, were configured to execute the payload. The malware repackages payload modules to imitate legitimate Mac apps, which are ultimately responsible for infecting local Xcode projects and injecting the main payload to execute when the compromised project builds.   XCSSET modules come with the capabilities to steal credentials, capture screenshots, inject malicious JavaScript into websites, plunder user data from different apps, and even encrypt files for a ransom.&nbsp;  Then in March 2021, Kaspersky researchers&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;XCSSET samples compiled for the new Apple M1 chips, suggesting that the malware campaign was not only ongoing but also that adversaries are&nbsp; activ

A malicious program intended to cause havoc with IT systems—malware—is becoming more and more sophisticated every year. The year 2021 is no exception, as recent trends indicate that several&nbsp; new variants of malware &nbsp;are making their way into the world of cybersecurity.  While smarter security solutions are popping up, modern malware still eludes and challenges cybersecurity experts.&nbsp;  The evolution of malware has infected everything from personal computers to industrial units since the 70s. Cybersecurity firm&nbsp; FireEye's network was attacked &nbsp;in 2020 by hackers with the most sophisticated form of hacking i.e., supply chain.  This hacking team demonstrated world-class capabilities to disregard security tools and forensic examination, proving that anybody can be hacked. Also, the year 2021 is already witnessing a bump in&nbsp; COVID-19 vaccine-related phishing attacks .&nbsp;  Let's take a look at the trends that forecast an increase in malware attacks:  COVID-19 and Work-from-Home (WFH)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented malware downloader has been spotted in the wild in phishing attacks to deploy credential stealers and other malicious payloads.  Dubbed " Saint Bot ," the malware is said to have first appeared on the scene in January 2021, with indications that it's under active development.  "Saint Bot is a downloader that appeared quite recently, and slowly is getting momentum. It was seen dropping stealers (i.e.&nbsp; Taurus &nbsp;Stealer) or further loaders ( example ), yet its design allows [it] to utilize it for distributing any kind of malware," said Aleksandra "Hasherezade" Doniec, a threat intelligence analyst at Malwarebytes.   "Furthermore, Saint Bot employs a wide variety of techniques which, although not novel, indicate some level of sophistication considering its relatively new appearance."  The infection chain analyzed by the cybersecurity firm begins with a phishing email containing an embedded ZIP file ("bitcoin.zip&amp;quo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Gigaset has revealed a malware infection discovered in its Android devices was the result of a compromise of a server belonging to an external update service provider.  Impacting older smartphone models — GS100, GS160, GS170, GS180, GS270 (plus), and GS370 (plus) series — the malware took the form of multiple&nbsp; unwanted apps &nbsp;that were downloaded and installed through a pre-installed system update app.  The infections are said to have occurred starting&nbsp; March 27 .   The German manufacturer of telecommunications devices said it took steps to alert the update service provider of the issue, following which further infections were prevented on April 7.  "Measures have been taken to automatically rid infected devices of the malware. In order for this to happen the devices must be connected to the internet (WLAN, WiFi or mobile data). We also recommend connecting the devices to their chargers. Affected devices should automatically be freed from the malware within 8 hours," the comp

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Iranian threat actor has unleashed a new cyberespionage campaign against a possible Lebanese target with a backdoor capable of exfiltrating sensitive information from compromised systems.  Cybersecurity firm Check Point attributed the operation to APT34, citing similarities with previous techniques used by the threat actor as well as based on its pattern of victimology.  APT34 &nbsp;(aka OilRig) is known for its reconnaissance campaigns aligned with the strategic interests of Iran, primarily hitting financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications industries in the Middle East.   The group typically resorts to targeting individuals through the use of booby-trapped job offer documents, delivered directly to the victims via LinkedIn messages, and the latest campaign is no exception, although the mode of delivery remains unclear as yet.  The Word document analyzed by Check Point — which was&nbsp; uploaded &nbsp;to VirusTotal from Lebanon on January 10 — claims to offer information abo

Besides masquerading as a Netflix app, the malicious "FlixOnline" app also requests intrusive permissions that allow it to create fake Login screens for other apps, with the goal of stealing credentials and gain access to

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what appears to be a fresh twist in Android malware, users of Gigaset mobile devices are encountering unwanted apps that are being downloaded and installed through a pre-installed system update app.  "The culprit installing these malware apps is the Update app, package name&nbsp; com.redstone.ota.ui , which is a pre-installed system app," Malwarebytes researcher Nathan Collier&nbsp; said . "This app is not only the mobile device's system updater, but also an auto installer known as Android/PUP.Riskware.Autoins.Redstone."  The development was&nbsp; first reported &nbsp;by German author and blogger Günter Born last week.   While the issue seems to be mainly affecting Gigaset phones, devices from a handful of other manufacturers appear to be impacted as well. The full list of devices that come with the pre-installed auto-installer includes Gigaset GS270, Gigaset GS160, Siemens GS270, Siemens GS160, Alps P40pro, and Alps S20pro+.  According to Malwarebytes, the Update app installs

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers on Tuesday revealed details of a new banking trojan targeting corporate users in Brazil at least since 2019 across various sectors such as engineering, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, finance, transportation, and government.  Dubbed " Janeleiro " by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, the malware aims to disguise its true intent via lookalike pop-up windows that are designed to resemble the websites of some of the biggest banks in the country, including Itaú Unibanco, Santander, Banco do Brasil, Caixa Econômica Federal, and Banco Bradesco.  "These pop-ups contain fake forms, aiming to trick the malware's victims into entering their banking credentials and personal information that the malware captures and exfiltrates to its [command-and-control] servers," ESET researchers Facundo Muñoz and Matías Porolli said in a write-up.   This modus operandi is not new to banking trojans. In August 2020, ESET uncovered a Latin American (LATAM) banking trojan call

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new spear-phishing campaign is targeting professionals on LinkedIn with weaponized job offers in an attempt to infect targets with a sophisticated backdoor trojan called "more_eggs."  To increase the odds of success, the phishing lures take advantage of malicious ZIP archive files that have the same name as that of the victims' job titles taken from their LinkedIn profiles.  "For example, if the LinkedIn member's job is listed as Senior Account Executive—International Freight the malicious zip file would be titled Senior Account Executive—International Freight position (note the 'position' added to the end)," cybersecurity firm eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis. "Upon opening the fake job offer, the victim unwittingly initiates the stealthy installation of the fileless backdoor, more_eggs."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Purple Fox , a Windows malware previously known for infecting machines by using exploit kits and phishing emails, has now added a new technique to its arsenal that gives it worm-like propagation capabilities.  The ongoing campaign makes use of a "novel spreading technique via indiscriminate port scanning and exploitation of exposed SMB services with weak passwords and hashes," according to&nbsp; Guardicore researchers , who say the attacks have spiked by about 600% since May 2020.  A total of 90,000 incidents have been spotted through the rest of 2020 and the beginning of 2021.   First discovered in March 2018,&nbsp;Purple Fox&nbsp;is distributed in the form of malicious ".msi" payloads hosted on nearly 2,000 compromised Windows servers that, in turn, download and execute a component with&nbsp; rootkit capabilities , which enables the threat actors to hide the malware on the machine and make it easy to evade detection.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday disclosed a new attack wherein threat actors are leveraging Xcode as an attack vector to compromise Apple platform developers with a backdoor, adding to a growing trend that involves targeting developers and researchers with malicious attacks.  Dubbed "XcodeSpy," the trojanized Xcode project is a tainted version of a legitimate, open-source project available on GitHub called TabBarInteraction that's used by developers to animate iOS tab bars based on user interaction.  "XcodeSpy is a malicious Xcode project that installs a custom variant of the EggShell backdoor on the developer's macOS computer along with a persistence mechanism," SentinelOne researchers&nbsp; said .   Xcode is Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS, used to develop software for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unwrapped an "interesting email campaign" undertaken by a threat actor that has taken to distributing a new malware written in&nbsp; Nim &nbsp;programming language.  Dubbed " NimzaLoader " by Proofpoint researchers, the development marks one of the rare instances of Nim malware discovered in the threat landscape.  "Malware developers may choose to use a rare programming language to avoid detection, as reverse engineers may not be familiar with Nim's implementation, or focused on developing detection for it, and therefore tools and sandboxes may struggle to analyze samples of it," the researchers said.   Proofpoint is tracking the operators of the campaign under the moniker "TA800," who, they say, started distributing NimzaLoader starting February 3, 2021. Prior to the latest raft of activity, TA800 is known to have predominantly used&nbsp;BazaLoader&nbsp;since April 2020.   While APT28 has been previously linked to delivering&nbsp; Zeb

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday shed light on a new sophisticated backdoor targeting Linux endpoints and servers that's believed to be the work of Chinese nation-state actors.  Dubbed " RedXOR " by Intezer, the backdoor masquerades as a polkit daemon, with similarities found between the malware and those previously associated with the&nbsp; Winnti Umbrella &nbsp;(or Axiom) threat group such as ​PWNLNX, ​XOR.DDOS​ and Groundhog.  RedXOR's name comes from the fact that it encodes its network data with a scheme based on XOR, and that it's compiled with a legacy&nbsp; GCC compiler &nbsp;on an old release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, suggesting that the malware is deployed in targeted attacks against legacy Linux systems.   Intezer said&nbsp; two &nbsp; samples &nbsp;of the malware were uploaded from Indonesia and Taiwan around Feb. 23-24, both countries that are known to be singled out by China-based threat groups.  Aside from the overlaps in terms of the overall flow and functionalities and th

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new malware dropper contained in as many as 9 Android apps distributed via Google Play Store that deploys a second stage malware capable of gaining intrusive access to the financial accounts of victims as well as full control of their devices.  "This dropper, dubbed Clast82, utilizes a series of techniques to avoid detection by Google Play Protect detection, completes the evaluation period successfully, and changes the payload dropped from a non-malicious payload to the AlienBot Banker and MRAT," Check Point researchers Aviran Hazum, Bohdan Melnykov, and Israel Wernik said in a write-up published  today.  The apps that were used for the campaign include Cake VPN, Pacific VPN, eVPN, BeatPlayer, QR/Barcode Scanner MAX, Music Player, tooltipnatorlibrary, and QRecorder. After the findings were reported to Google on January 28, the rogue apps were removed from the Play Store on February 9.&nbsp;   Malware authors have resorted to a variety o

Malware Can Exploit New Flaw in Intel CPUs to Launch Side-Channel Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/malware-can-exploit-new-flaw-in-intel.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new research has yielded yet another means to pilfer sensitive data by exploiting what's the first "on-chip, cross-core" side-channel in Intel Coffee Lake and Skylake processors.  Published by a group of academics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the&nbsp; findings &nbsp;are expected to be presented at the USENIX Security Symposium coming this August.  While information leakage attacks targeting the CPU microarchitecture have been previously demonstrated to break the isolation between user applications and the operating system, allowing a malicious program to access memory used by other programs (e.g., Meltdown and Spectre), the new attack leverages a contention on the ring interconnect.  SoC&nbsp; Ring interconnect &nbsp;is an on-die bus arranged in a ring topology which enables intra-process communication between different components (aka agents) such as the cores, the last level cache (LLC), the graphics unit, and the system agent that are housed inside the CPU.

A framework notorious for delivering a banking Trojan has received a facelift to deploy a wider range of malware, including ransomware payloads.  "The&nbsp; Gootkit &nbsp;malware family has been around more than half a decade – a mature Trojan with functionality centered around banking credential theft," Sophos researchers Gabor Szappanos and Andrew Brandt&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published today.  "In recent years, almost as much effort has gone into improvement of its delivery method as has gone into the NodeJS-based malware itself."  Dubbed "Gootloader," the expanded malware delivery system comes amid a surge in the number of infections targeting users in France, Germany, South Korea, and the U.S.   First documented in 2014, Gootkit is a Javascript-based malware platform capable of carrying out an array of covert activities, including web injection, capturing keystrokes, taking screenshots, recording videos, as well as email and password theft.

A credential stealer infamous for targeting Windows systems has resurfaced in a new phishing campaign that aims to steal credentials from Microsoft Outlook, Google Chrome, and instant messenger apps.  Primarily directed against users in Turkey, Latvia, and Italy starting mid-January, the attacks involve the use of&nbsp; MassLogger &nbsp;— a .NET-based malware with capabilities to hinder static analysis — building on similar campaigns undertaken by the same actor against users in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Hungary, Estonia, Romania, and Spain in September, October, and November 2020.  MassLogger was first spotted in the wild last April, but the presence of a new variant implies malware authors are constantly retooling their arsenal to evade detection and monetize them.   "Although operations of the Masslogger trojan have been previously documented, we found the new campaign notable for using the compiled HTML file format to start the infection chain," researchers with Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;on W

First Malware Designed for Apple M1 Chip Discovered in the Wild<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/first-malware-designed-for-apple-m1.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
One of the first malware samples tailored to run natively on Apple's M1 chips has been discovered, suggesting a new development that indicates that bad actors have begun adapting malicious software to target the company's latest generation of Macs powered by its own processors.  While the transition to Apple silicon has necessitated developers to build new versions of their apps to ensure better performance and compatibility, malware authors are now undertaking similar steps to build malware that are capable of executing natively on Apple's new M1 systems, according to macOS Security researcher Patrick Wardle.  Wardle detailed a Safari adware extension called GoSearch22 that was originally written to run on Intel x86 chips but has since been ported to run on ARM-based M1 chips. The rogue extension, which is a variant of the Pirrit advertising malware, was first seen in the wild on November 23, 2020, according to a sample&nbsp; uploaded &nbsp;to VirusTotal on December 27.

A previously known Windows remote access Trojan (RAT) with credential-stealing capabilities has now expanded its scope to set its sights on users of Android devices to further the attacker's espionage motives.  "The developers of&nbsp; LodaRAT &nbsp;have added Android as a targeted platform," Cisco Talos researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. "A new iteration of LodaRAT for Windows has been identified with improved sound recording capabilities."  Kasablanca, the group behind the malware, is said to have deployed the new RAT in an ongoing hybrid campaign targeting Bangladeshi users, the researchers noted.  The reason why Bangladesh-based organizations have been specifically singled out for this campaign remains unclear, as is the identity of the threat actor.   First documented in May 2017 by&nbsp; Proofpoint , Loda is an AutoIt malware typically delivered via phishing lures that's equipped to run a wide range of commands designed to record audio, video, and capture oth

Google on Thursday removed The Great Suspender , a popular Chrome extension used by millions of users, from its Chrome Web Store for containing malware. It also took the unusual step of deactivating it from users' computers.  "This extension contains malware,"&nbsp; read &nbsp;a terse notification from Google, but it has since emerged that the add-on stealthily added features that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code from a remote server, including tracking users online and committing advertising fraud.  "The old maintainer appears to have sold the extension to parties unknown, who have malicious intent to exploit the users of this extension in advertising fraud, tracking, and more," Calum McConnell&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a GitHub post.   The extension, which had more than two million installs before it was disabled, would suspend tabs that aren't in use, replacing them with a blank gray screen until they were reloaded upon returning to the tabs in question.

New details have emerged about a vast network of rogue extensions for Chrome and Edge browsers that were found to hijack clicks to links in search results pages to arbitrary URLs, including phishing sites and ads.  Collectively called " CacheFlow " by Avast, the 28 extensions in question — including Video Downloader for Facebook, Vimeo Video Downloader, Instagram Story Downloader, VK Unblock — made use of a sneaky trick to mask its true purpose: Leverage&nbsp; Cache-Control &nbsp;HTTP header as a covert channel to retrieve commands from an attacker-controlled server.  All the&nbsp; backdoored browser add-ons &nbsp;have been taken down by Google and Microsoft as of December 18, 2020, to prevent more users from downloading them from the official stores.   According to telemetry data gathered by the firm, the top three infected countries were Brazil, Ukraine, and France, followed by Argentina, Spain, Russia, and the U.S.   The CacheFlow sequence began when unsuspecting users downloaded one of the

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
High-performance computing clusters belonging to university networks as well as servers associated with government agencies, endpoint security vendors, and internet service providers have been targeted by a newly discovered backdoor that gives attackers the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the systems remotely.  Cybersecurity firm ESET named the malware " Kobalos " — a nod to a " mischievous creature " of the same name from Greek mythology — for its "tiny code size and many tricks."  "Kobalos is a generic backdoor in the sense that it contains broad commands that don't reveal the intent of the attackers," researchers Marc-Etienne M. Léveillé and Ignacio Sanmillan&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. "In short, Kobalos grants remote access to the file system, provides the ability to spawn terminal sessions, and allows proxying connections to other Kobalos-infected servers."   Besides tracing the malware back to attacks against a nu

Agent Tesla Malware Spotted Using New Delivery &amp; Evasion Techniques<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/agent-tesla-malware-spotted-using-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers on Tuesday uncovered new delivery and evasion techniques adopted by Agent Tesla remote access trojan (RAT) to get around defense barriers and monitor its victims.  Typically spread through&nbsp;social engineering&nbsp;lures, the Windows spyware not only now targets Microsoft's Antimalware Scan Interface ( AMSI ) in an attempt to defeat endpoint protection software, it also employs a multi-stage installation process and makes use of Tor and Telegram messaging API to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server.  Cybersecurity firm Sophos , which observed two versions of Agent Tesla — version 2 and version 3 — currently in the wild, said the changes are yet another sign of Agent Tesla's constant evolution designed to make a sandbox and static analysis more difficult.   "The differences we see between v2 and v3 of Agent Tesla appear to be focused on improving the success rate of the malware against sandbox defenses and malware scanners, and on providing more

Cybersecurity researchers today disclosed a new supply chain attack compromising the update mechanism of NoxPlayer, a free Android emulator for PCs and Macs.  Dubbed " Operation NightScout " by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, the highly-targeted surveillance campaign involved distributing three different malware families via tailored malicious updates to selected victims based in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka.  NoxPlayer, developed by Hong Kong-based BigNox, is an Android emulator that allows users to play mobile games on PC, with support for keyboard, gamepad, script recording, and multiple instances. It is&nbsp; estimated &nbsp;to have over 150 million users in more than 150 countries.   First signs of the ongoing attack are said to have originated around September 2020, from when the compromise continued until "explicitly malicious activity" was uncovered this week, prompting ESET to report the incident to BigNox.

"Pro-Ocean uses known vulnerabilities to target cloud applications," the researchers detailed. "In our analysis, we found Pro-Ocean targeting Apache ActiveMQ ( CVE-2016-3088 ), Oracle WebLogic ( CVE-2017-10271 ) and Redis (unsecure instances)."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly discovered Android malware has been found to propagate itself through WhatsApp messages to other contacts in order to expand what appears to be an adware campaign.  "This malware spreads via victim's WhatsApp by automatically replying to any received WhatsApp message notification with a link to [a] malicious Huawei Mobile app," ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko  said.  The link to the fake Huawei Mobile app, upon clicking, redirects users to a lookalike Google Play Store website.  Once installed, the wormable app prompts victims to grant it notification access, which is then abused to carry out the wormable attack.   Specifically, it leverages WhatApp's quick reply feature — which is used to respond to incoming messages directly from the notifications — to send out a reply to a received message automatically.  Besides requesting permissions to read notifications, the app also requests intrusive access to run in the background as well as to draw over other apps,

MrbMiner Crypto-Mining Malware Links to Iranian Software Company<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/mrbminer-crypto-mining-malware-links-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A relatively new crypto-mining malware that surfaced last year and infected thousands of Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) databases has now been linked to a small software development company based in Iran.  The attribution was made possible due to an operational security oversight, said researchers from cybersecurity firm Sophos, that led to the company's name inadvertently making its way into the cryptominer code.  First documented by Chinese tech giant Tencent last September,&nbsp; MrbMiner &nbsp;was found to target internet-facing MSSQL servers with the goal of installing a cryptominer, which hijacks the processing power of the systems to mine Monero and funnel them into accounts controlled by the attackers.  The name "MrbMiner" comes after one of the domains used by the group to host their malicious mining software.   "In many ways, MrbMiner's operations appear typical of most cryptominer attacks we've seen targeting internet-facing servers,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Gabor Szappa

Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a fourth new malware strain—designed to spread the malware onto other computers in victims' networks—which was deployed as part of the&nbsp; SolarWinds supply chain attack &nbsp;disclosed late last year.  Dubbed "Raindrop" by Broadcom-owned Symantec, the malware joins the likes of other malicious implants such as&nbsp; Sunspot , Sunburst (or Solorigate), and Teardrop that were stealthily delivered to enterprise networks.   The latest finding comes amid a continued probe into the breach, suspected to be of&nbsp; Russian origin , that has claimed a number of U.S. government agencies and private sector companies.  "The discovery of Raindrop is a significant step in our investigation of the SolarWinds attacks as it provides further insights into post-compromise activity at organizations of interest to the attackers," Symantec researchers&nbsp; said .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing malware campaign has been found exploiting recently disclosed vulnerabilities in Linux devices to co-opt the systems into an&nbsp; IRC botnet &nbsp;for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and mining Monero cryptocurrency.  The attacks involve a new malware variant called " FreakOut " that leverages newly patched flaws in TerraMaster, Laminas Project (formerly Zend Framework), and Liferay Portal, according to Check Point Research's new analysis published  today and shared with The Hacker News.   Attributing the malware to be the work of a long-time cybercrime hacker — who goes by the aliases Fl0urite and Freak on HackForums and Pastebin as early as 2015 — the researchers said the flaws —&nbsp; CVE-2020-28188 ,&nbsp; CVE-2021-3007 , and&nbsp; CVE-2020-7961 &nbsp;— were weaponized to inject and execute malicious commands in the server.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a series of attacks by a threat actor of Chinese origin that has targeted organizations in Russia and Hong Kong with malware — including a previously undocumented backdoor.  Attributing the campaign to&nbsp; Winnti &nbsp;(or APT41), Positive Technologies dated the first attack to May 12, 2020, when the APT used LNK shortcuts to extract and run the malware payload. A second attack detected on May 30 used a malicious RAR archive file consisting of shortcuts to two bait PDF documents claimed to be a curriculum vitae and an IELTS certificate.   The shortcuts themselves contain links to pages hosted on Zeplin, a legitimate collaboration tool for designers and developers that are used to fetch the final-stage malware that, in turn, includes a shellcode loader ("svchast.exe") and a backdoor called&nbsp; Crosswalk &nbsp;("3t54dE3r.tmp").  Crosswalk, first documented by FireEye in 2017, is a bare-bones modular backdoor capable of carrying out system r

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers took the wraps off an ongoing surveillance campaign directed against Colombian government institutions and private companies in the energy and metallurgical industries.  In a report published by ESET on Tuesday, the Slovak internet security company said the attacks — dubbed " Operation Spalax " — began in 2020, with the modus operandi sharing some similarities to an APT group targeting the country since at least April 2018, but also different in other ways.  The overlaps come in the form of phishing emails, which have similar topics and pretend to come from some of the same entities that were used in a February 2019 operation disclosed by&nbsp; QiAnXin researchers , and subdomain names used for command-and-control (C2) servers.   However, the two campaigns diverge in the attachments used for phishing emails, the remote access trojans (RATs) deployed, and the C2 infrastructure employed to fetch the malware dropped.  The attack chain begins with the target

Cybersecurity researchers have exposed the operations of an Android malware vendor who teamed up with a second threat actor to market and sell a remote access Trojan (RAT) capable of device takeover and exfiltration of photos, locations, contacts, and messages from popular apps such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Skype, Telegram, Kik, Line, and Google Messages.  The vendor, who goes by the name of " Triangulum " in a number of darknet forums, is alleged to be a 25-year-old man of Indian origin, with the individual opening up shop to sell the malware three years ago on June 10, 2017, according to an analysis published by Check Point  Research today.  "The product was a mobile RAT, targeting Android devices and capable of exfiltration of sensitive data from a C&amp;C server, destroying local data – even deleting the entire OS, at times," the researchers said.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the investigation into the SolarWinds supply-chain attack continues, cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a third malware strain that was deployed into the build environment to inject the backdoor into the company's Orion network monitoring platform.  Called " Sunspot ," the backdoor adds to a growing list of previously disclosed malicious software such as Sunburst and Teardrop.  "This highly sophisticated and novel code was designed to inject the Sunburst malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion Platform without arousing the suspicion of our software development and build teams," SolarWinds' new CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna&nbsp; explained .   While&nbsp; preliminary evidence &nbsp;found that operators behind the espionage campaign managed to compromise the software build and code signing infrastructure of SolarWinds Orion platform as early as October 2019 to deliver the Sunburst backdoor, the latest findings reveal a new timeline that establishes the first breach of

Cybersecurity researchers, for the first time, may have found a potential connection between the backdoor used in&nbsp; the SolarWinds hack &nbsp;to a previously known malware strain.  In new&nbsp; research &nbsp;published by Kaspersky researchers today, the cybersecurity firm said it discovered several features that overlap with another backdoor known as&nbsp; Kazuar , a .NET-based malware first documented by Palo Alto Networks in 2017.  Disclosed early last month, the&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;was notable for its scale and stealth, with the attackers leveraging the trust associated with SolarWinds Orion software to infiltrate government agencies and other companies so as to deploy a custom malware codenamed "Sunburst."  Shared Features Between Sunburst and Kazuar  Attribution for the SolarWinds supply-chain compromise has been difficult in part due to little-to-no clues linking the attack infrastructure to previous campaigns or other well-known threat groups.

Cybesecurity researchers today revealed  a new malspam campaign that distributes a remote access Trojan (RAT) by purporting to contain a sex scandal video of U.S. President Donald Trump.  The emails, which carry with the subject line "GOOD LOAN OFFER!!," come attached with a Java archive (JAR) file called "TRUMP_SEX_SCANDAL_VIDEO.jar," which, when downloaded, installs Qua or Quaverse RAT ( QRAT ) onto the infiltrated system.  "We suspect that the bad guys are attempting to ride the frenzy brought about by the recently concluded Presidential elections since the filename they used on the attachment is totally unrelated to the email's theme," Trustwave's Senior Security Researcher Diana Lopera said in a write-up published today.   The latest campaign is a variant of the Windows-based QRAT downloader Trustwave researchers&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;in August.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers today revealed a wide-ranging scam targeting cryptocurrency users that began as early as January last year to distribute trojanized applications to install a previously undetected remote access tool on target systems.  Called ElectroRAT  by Intezer, the RAT is written from ground-up in Golang and designed to target multiple operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.&nbsp;  The apps are developed using the open-source Electron cross-platform desktop app framework.  "ElectroRAT is the latest example of attackers using Golang to develop multi-platform malware and evade most antivirus engines," the researchers said .   "It is common to see various information stealers trying to collect private keys to access victims wallets. However, it is rare to see tools written from scratch and targeting multiple operating systems for these purposes."  The campaign, first detected in December, is believed to have claimed over 6,500 victims based on th

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors have been discovered distributing a new credential stealer written in AutoHotkey (AHK) scripting language as part of an ongoing campaign that started early 2020.  Customers of financial institutions in the US and Canada are among the primary targets for credential exfiltration, with a specific focus on banks such as Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Canada, HSBC, Alterna Bank, Capital One, Manulife, and EQ Bank. Also included in the list is an Indian banking firm ICICI Bank.  AutoHotkey &nbsp;is an open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows aimed at providing easy hotkeys for macro-creation and software automation that allows users to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows application.   The multi-stage infection chain commences with a malware-laced Excel file that's embedded with a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)&nbsp; AutoOpen &nbsp;macro, which is subsequently used to drop and execute the downloader client script ("adb.ahk") via a legitimate portable AHK

The information security news cycle went into overdrive yesterday afternoon. First, Reuters revealed that the Commerce and Treasury departments suffered significant intrusions. The Washington Post soon followed up with multiple sources attributing the attack to the Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVR—in particular, a portion of the SVR known as Cozy Bear—although there is no official attribution yet. Within a few hours, FireEye and Microsoft announced that this was a “supply chain attack” involving SolarWinds Orion software, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an emergency directive. Today, it turns out that the attackers also compromised the Department of Homeland Security. SolarWinds revealed to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the breach may affect 18,000 customers.
