<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Image Source: Toptal  The notorious Emotet malware has turned to deploy a new module designed to siphon credit card information stored in the Chrome web browser.  The credit card stealer, which exclusively singles out Chrome, has the ability to exfiltrate the collected information to different remote command-and-control (C2) servers, according to enterprise security company  Proofpoint , which observed the component on June 6.  The development comes amid a  spike  in  Emotet   activity  since it was resurrected late last year following a 10-month-long hiatus in the wake of a law enforcement operation that  took down its attack infrastructure  in January 2021.  Emotet, attributed to a threat actor known as TA542 (aka Mummy Spider or Gold Crestwood), is an advanced, self-propagating and modular trojan that's delivered via email campaigns and is used as a distributor for other payloads such as ransomware.   As of April 2022, Emotet is still the most popular malware with a global impac

Researchers Warn of Unpatched "DogWalk" Microsoft Windows Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/researchers-warn-of-unpatched-dogwalk.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unofficial security patch has been made available for a new Windows zero-day vulnerability in the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), even as the Follina flaw continues to be exploited in the wild.  The issue — referenced as  DogWalk  — relates to a path traversal flaw that can be exploited to stash a malicious executable file to the Windows Startup folder when a potential target opens a specially crafted ".diagcab" archive file that contains a diagnostics configuration file.  The idea is that the payload would get executed the next time the victim logs in to the system after a restart. The vulnerability affects all Windows versions, starting from Windows 7 and Server Server 2008 to the latest releases.   DogWalk was originally  disclosed  by security researcher Imre Rad in January 2020 after Microsoft, having acknowledged the problem, deemed it as not a security issue.  "There are a number of file types that can execute code in such a way but aren't techni

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have  warned  about China-based state-sponsored cyber actors leveraging network vulnerabilities to exploit public and private sector organizations since at least 2020.  The widespread intrusion campaigns aim to exploit publicly identified security flaws in network devices such as Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) routers and Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices with the goal of gaining deeper access to victim networks.  In addition, the actors used these compromised devices as route command-and-control (C2) traffic to break into other targets at scale, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  said  in a joint advisory.   The perpetrators, besides shifting their tactics in response to public disclosures, are known to employ a mix of open-source and custom tools for reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning as well as to obscure and ble

An illicit online marketplace known as SSNDOB  was taken down in operation led by U.S. law enforcement agencies, the Department of Justice (DoJ) announced Tuesday.  SSNDOB trafficked in personal information such as names, dates of birth, credit card numbers, and Social Security numbers of about 24 million individuals in the U.S., generating its operators $19 million in sales revenue.  The action saw the seizure of several domains associated with the marketplace — ssndob.ws, ssndob.vip, ssndob.club, and blackjob.biz — in cooperation with authorities from Cyprus and Latvia.  According to blockchain analytics firm  Chainalysis , SSNDOB's Bitcoin payment processing system has received nearly $22 million worth of Bitcoin across over 100,000 transactions since April 2015.   Furthermore, bitcoin transfers to the tune of more than $100,000 have been unearthed between SSNDOB and  Joker's Stash , another darknet market that specialized in stolen credit card information and voluntarily c

Evil Corp Cybercrime Group Shifts to LockBit Ransomware to Evade Sanctions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/evil-corp-cybercrime-group-shifts-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat cluster dubbed UNC2165, which shares numerous overlaps with a Russia-based cybercrime group known as Evil Corp, has been linked to multiple LockBit ransomware intrusions in an attempt to get around  sanctions  imposed by the U.S. Treasury in December 2019.  "These actors have shifted away from using exclusive ransomware variants to LockBit — a well-known ransomware as a service (RaaS) — in their operations, likely to hinder attribution efforts in order to evade sanctions," threat intelligence firm Mandiant  noted  in an analysis last week.  Active since 2019, UNC2165 is known to obtain initial access to victim networks via stolen credentials and a JavaScript-based downloader malware called  FakeUpdates  (aka SocGholish), leveraging it to previously deploy  Hades  ransomware.   Hades is the work of a financially motivated hacking group named Evil Corp, which is also called by the monikers Gold Drake and Indrik Spider and has been attributed to the infamous  Dridex

Enforcing the "double-extortion" technique aka pay-now-or-get-breached emerged as a head-turner last year.   May 6th, 2022 is a recent example.  The State Department said the Conti strain of ransomware was the most costly in terms of payments made by victims as of January .  Conti, a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) program, is one of the most notorious ransomware groups and has been responsible for infecting hundreds of servers with malware to gain corporate data or digital damage systems, essentially spreading misery to individuals and hospitals, businesses, government agencies and more all over the world.  So, how different is a  ransomware attack  like Conti from the infamous "WannaCry" or "NotPetya"?  While other Ransomware variants can spread fast and encrypt files within short time frames, Conti ransomware has demonstrated unmatched speed by which it can access victims' systems.  Given the recent spate of data breaches, it is extremely challengin

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new wave of phishing campaigns has been observed spreading a previously documented malware called SVCReady .  "The malware is notable for the unusual way it is delivered to target PCs — using shellcode hidden in the properties of Microsoft Office documents," Patrick Schläpfer, a threat analyst at HP,  said  in a technical write-up.  SVCReady is said to be in its early stage of development, with the authors iteratively updating the malware several times last month. First signs of activity date back to April 22, 2022.  Infection chains involve sending Microsoft Word document attachments to targets via email that contain VBA macros to activate the deployment of malicious payloads.   But where this campaign stands apart is that instead of employing PowerShell or MSHTA to retrieve next-stage executables from a remote server, the macro runs shellcode stored in the  document properties , which subsequently drops the SVCReady malware.  In addition to achieving persistence on the i

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple has introduced a Rapid Security Response feature  in iOS 16 and macOS Ventura that's designed to deploy security fixes without the need for a full operating system version update.  "macOS security gets even stronger with new tools that make the Mac more resistant to attack, including Rapid Security Response that works in between normal updates to easily keep security up to date without a reboot," the company  said  in a statement on Monday.  The feature, which also works on iOS , aims to separate regular software updates from critical security improvements and are applied automatically so that users are quickly protected against in-the-wild attacks  and unexpected threats. It's worth noting that Apple tested an analogous option  in iOS 14.5.   Rapid Security Response, viewed in that light, mirrors a similar approach taken by Google through Play Services  and Play Protect  to secure Android devices from malware and other kinds of fraud.

Some of the most targeted apps include Walmart-backed PhonePe, Binance, Cash App, Garanti BBVA Mobile, La Banque Postale, Ma Banque, Caf - Mon Compte, Postepay, and BBVA México. These apps alone account for more than 260 million downloads from the official app marketplace.  Of the 639 apps tracked, 121 are based in the U.S., followed by the U.K. (55), Italy (43), Turkey (34), Australia (33), France (31), Spain (29), and Portugal (27).  " TeaBot  is targeting 410 of the 639 applications tracked," mobile security company Zimperium  said  in a new analysis of Android threats during the first half of 2022. " Octo  targets 324 of the 639 applications tracked and is the only one targeting popular, non-financial applications for credential theft."   Aside from  TeaBot  (

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed  two unpatched security vulnerabilities  in the open-source U-Boot boot loader.  The issues, which were uncovered in the  IP defragmentation  algorithm implemented in U-Boot by NCC Group, could be abused to achieve arbitrary out-of-bounds write and denial-of-service (DoS).  U-Boot is a  boot loader  used in Linux-based embedded systems such as ChromeOS as well as ebook readers such as Amazon Kindle and Kobo eReader.   The issues are summarized below -   CVE-2022-30790  (CVSS score: 9.6) - Hole Descriptor overwrite in U-Boot IP packet defragmentation leads to an arbitrary out-of-bounds write primitive.  CVE-2022-30552  (CVSS score: 7.1) - Large buffer overflow leads to DoS in U-Boot IP packet defragmentation code   It's worth noting that both the flaws are exploitable only from the local network. But doing so can enable an attacker to root the devices and lead to a DoS by crafting a malformed packet.  The shortcomings are expected to be addr

Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) last week disclosed that it had taken legal proceedings against an Iranian threat actor dubbed  Bohrium  in connection with a spear-phishing operation.  The adversarial collective is said to have targeted entities in tech, transportation, government, and education sectors located in the U.S., Middle East, and India.   "Bohrium actors create fake social media profiles, often posing as recruiters," Amy Hogan-Burney of the DCU  said  in a tweet. "Once personal information was obtained from the victims, Bohrium sent malicious emails with links that ultimately infected their target's computers with malware."  According to an  ex parte order  shared by the tech giant, the goal of the intrusions was to steal and exfiltrate sensitive information, take control over the infected machines, and carry out remote reconnaissance.  To halt the malicious activities of Bohrium, Microsoft said it took down 41 ".com," ".info

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
"Shifting (security)" left approach in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) means starting security earlier in the process. As organizations realized that software never comes out perfectly and are riddled with many exploitable holes, bugs, and business logic vulnerabilities that require going back to fix and patch, they understood that building secure software requires incorporating and consolidating numerous resources.  This conclusion led DevOps and R&D leaders to become proactive, acquiring technology to find and close these gaps in advance, with the aim of reducing the cost and effort while improving the quality of their outcomes.   With emerging comprehensive  continuous security validation technology , the demonstrated benefits of 'shifting left' as a fundamental part of SDLC can now be applied to your cybersecurity program, with results far exceeding the purely technical aspects of security posture management.   At the development level, the conceptuali

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have issued an advisory about critical security vulnerabilities in Illumina's next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) software.  Three of the flaws are rated 10 out of 10 for severity on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System ( CVSS ), with two others having severity ratings of 9.1 and 7.4.  The issues impact software in medical devices used for "clinical diagnostic use in sequencing a person's DNA or testing for various genetic conditions, or for research use only,"  according to the FDA .   "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an unauthenticated malicious actor to take control of the affected product remotely and take any action at the operating system level," CISA  said  in an alert.

A suspected state-aligned threat actor has been attributed to a new set of attacks exploiting the Microsoft Office "Follina" vulnerability to target government entities in Europe and the U.S.  Enterprise security firm Proofpoint said it blocked attempts at exploiting the remote code execution flaw, which is being tracked  CVE-2022-30190  (CVSS score: 7.8). No less than 1,000 phishing messages containing a lure document were sent to the targets.  "This campaign masqueraded as a salary increase and utilized an RTF with the exploit payload downloaded from 45.76.53[.]253," the company  said  in a series of tweets.   The payload, which manifests in the form of a PowerShell script, is Base64-encoded and functions as a downloader to retrieve a second PowerShell script from a remote server named "seller-notification[.]live."

Atlassian on Friday rolled out fixes to address a  critical security flaw  affecting its Confluence Server and Data Center products that have come under active exploitation by threat actors to achieve remote code execution.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-26134 , the issue is similar to  CVE-2021-26084  — another security flaw the Australian software company patched in August 2021.

The newly discovered shortcoming impacts all supported versions of Confluence Server and Data Center, with every version after 1.3.0 also affected.

Chinese LuoYu Hackers Using Man-on-the-Side Attacks to Deploy WinDealer Backdoor<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/chinese-luoyu-hackers-using-man-on-side.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An "extremely sophisticated" Chinese-speaking advanced persistent threat (APT) actor dubbed  LuoYu  has been observed using a malicious Windows tool called WinDealer that's delivered by means of man-on-the-side attacks.  "This groundbreaking development allows the actor to modify network traffic in-transit to insert malicious payloads," Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky  said  in a new report. "Such attacks are especially dangerous and devastating because they do not require any interaction with the target to lead to a successful infection."  Known to be active since 2008, organizations targeted by LuoYu are predominantly foreign diplomatic organizations established in China and members of the academic community as well as financial, defense, logistics, and telecommunications companies.   LuoYu's use of  WinDealer  was first documented by Taiwanese cybersecurity firm  TeamT5  at the Japan Security Analyst Conference (JSAC) in January 2021. S

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Parrot traffic direction system (TDS) that came to light earlier this year has had a larger impact than previously thought, according to new research.  Sucuri, which has been tracking the same campaign since February 2019 under the name "NDSW/NDSX," said that "the malware was one of the top infections" detected in 2021, accounting for more than 61,000 websites.  Parrot TDS was  documented  in April 2022 by Czech cybersecurity company Avast, noting that the PHP script had ensnared web servers hosting more than 16,500 websites to act as a gateway for further attack campaigns.  This involves appending a piece of malicious code to all JavaScript files on compromised web servers hosting content management systems (CMS) such as WordPress that are in turn said to be breached by taking advantage of weak login credentials and vulnerable plugins.   Besides using different obfuscation tactics to conceal the code, the "injected JavaScript may also be found well indent

Microsoft on Thursday said it took steps to disable malicious activity stemming from abuse of OneDrive by a previously undocumented threat actor it tracks under the chemical element-themed moniker Polonium.  In addition to removing the offending accounts created by the Lebanon-based activity group, the tech giant's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said it suspended over 20 malicious OneDrive applications created and that it notified affected organizations.  "The observed activity was coordinated with other actors affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), based primarily on victim overlap and commonality of tools and techniques," MSTIC  assessed  with "moderate confidence."   The adversarial collective is believed to have breached more than 20 organizations based in Israel and one intergovernmental organization with operations in Lebanon since February 2022.  Targets of interest included entities in the manufacturing, IT, transpo

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the threat landscape evolves and multiplies with more advanced attacks than ever, defending against these modern cyber threats is a monumental challenge for almost any organization.   Threat detection is about an organization's ability to accurately identify threats, be it to the network, an endpoint, another asset or an application – including cloud infrastructure and assets. At scale, threat detection analyzes the entire security infrastructure to identify malicious activity that could compromise the ecosystem.  Countless solutions support threat detection, but the key is to have as much data as possible available to bolster your security visibility. If you don't know what is happening on your systems, threat detection is impossible.   Deploying the right security software is critical for protecting you from threats.  What do we mean by threat detection software?  In the early days of threat detection, software was deployed to protect against different forms of malware. However,

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of  leaked chats  from the notorious  Conti ransomware group  earlier this year has revealed that the syndicate has been working on a set of firmware attack techniques that could offer a path to accessing privileged code on compromised devices.  "Control over firmware gives attackers virtually unmatched powers both to directly cause damage and to enable other long-term strategic goals," firmware and hardware security firm Eclypsium  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "Such level of access would allow an adversary to cause irreparable damage to a system or to establish ongoing persistence that is virtually invisible to the operating system."   Specifically, this includes attacks aimed at embedded microcontrollers such as the Intel  Management Engine  ( ME ), a privileged component that's part of the company's processor chipsets and which can completely bypass the operating system.  It's worth noting that the reason for this evolv

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As ransomware infections have evolved from purely encrypting data to schemes such as double and triple extortion, a new attack vector is likely to set the stage for future campaigns.  Called Ransomware for IoT or  R4IoT  by Forescout, it's a "novel, proof-of-concept ransomware that exploits an IoT device to gain access and move laterally in an IT [information technology] network and impact the OT [operational technology] network."  This potential pivot is based on the rapid growth in the number of IoT devices as well as the convergence of IT and OT networks in organizations.   The ultimate goal of R4IoT is to leverage exposed and vulnerable IoT devices such as IP cameras to gain an initial foothold, followed by deploying ransomware in the IT network and taking advantage of poor operational security practices to hold mission-critical processes hostage.  "By compromising IoT, IT, and OT assets, R4IoT goes beyond the usual encryption and data exfiltration to cause phys

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new unpatched security vulnerability has been disclosed in the open-source Horde Webmail client that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution on the email server simply by sending a specially crafted email to a victim.  "Once the email is viewed, the attacker can silently take over the complete mail server without any further user interaction," SonarSource said in a report  shared with The Hacker News. "The vulnerability exists in the default configuration and can be exploited with no knowledge of a targeted Horde instance."  The issue, which has been assigned the CVE identifier  CVE-2022-30287 , was reported to the vendor on February 2, 2022. The maintainers of the Horde Project did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the unresolved vulnerability.   At its core, the issue makes it possible for an authenticated user of a Horde instance to run malicious code on the underlying server by taking advantage of a quirk in how the client

The "complex investigation" included authorities from Australia, Belgium, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the U.S.  FluBot , also called Cabassous, emerged in the wild in December 2020, masking its insidious intent behind the veneer of seemingly innocuous package tracking applications such as FedEx, DHL, and Correos.   It primarily spreads via smishing (aka SMS-based phishing) messages that trick unsuspecting recipients into clicking on a link to download the malware-laced apps.

"Attackers impersonated benign plugin authors and spread malware by distributing pirated plugins," the researchers  said  in a new paper titled " Mistrust Plugins You Must ."   "The number of malicious plugins on websites has steadily increased over the years, and malicious activity peaked in March 2020. Shockingly, 94% of the malicious plugins installed over those 8 years are still active today."

New XLoader Botnet Version Using Probability Theory to Hide its C&C Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/new-xloader-botnet-version-using.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An enhanced version of the XLoader malware has been spotted adopting a probability-based approach to camouflage its command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure, according to the latest research.  "Now it is significantly harder to separate the wheat from the chaff and discover the real C&C servers among thousands of legitimate domains used by Xloader as a smokescreen," Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point  said .  First spotted in the wild in October 2020, XLoader is a successor to Formbook and a  cross-platform information stealer  that's capable of plundering credentials from web browsers, capturing keystrokes and screenshots, and executing arbitrary commands and payloads.   More recently, the  ongoing geopolitical conflict  between Russia and Ukraine has proved to be a lucrative fodder for  distributing XLoader  by means of  phishing emails  aimed at high-ranking government officials in Ukraine.  The latest findings from Check Point build on a previous repor

An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor aligned with Chinese state interests has been observed weaponizing the new  zero-day flaw  in Microsoft Office to achieve code execution on affected systems.  "TA413 CN APT spotted [in-the-wild] exploiting the Follina zero-day using URLs to deliver ZIP archives which contain Word Documents that use the technique," enterprise security firm Proofpoint  said  in a tweet.  "Campaigns impersonate the 'Women Empowerments Desk' of the Central Tibetan Administration and use the domain tibet-gov.web[.]app."  TA413  is best known for its campaigns aimed at the Tibetan diaspora to deliver implants such as  Exile RAT  and  Sepulcher  as well as a rogue Firefox browser extension dubbed  FriarFox .   The high-severity security flaw, dubbed Follina and tracked as CVE-2022-30190 (CVSS score: 7.8), relates to a case of remote code execution that abuses the "ms-msdt:" protocol URI scheme to execute arbitrary code.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of the mobile threat landscape in 2022 shows that Spain and Turkey are the most targeted countries for malware campaigns, even as a mix of new and existing banking trojans are increasingly targeting Android devices to conduct on-device fraud (ODF).  Other frequently targeted countries include Poland, Australia, the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Italy, France, and Portugal.  "The most worrying leitmotif is the increasing attention to On-Device Fraud (ODF)," Dutch cybersecurity company ThreatFabric  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "Just in the first five months of 2022 there has been an increase of more than 40% in malware families that abuse Android OS to perform fraud using the device itself, making it almost impossible to detect them using traditional fraud scoring engines."   Hydra ,  FluBot  (aka Cabassous),  Cerberus ,  Octo , and  ERMAC  accounted for the most active banking trojans based on the number of samples observed during the same

An "aggressive" advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as SideWinder  has been linked to over 1,000 new attacks since April 2020.

SideWinder , also called Rattlesnake or T-APT-04, is said to have been active since at least 2012 with a  track record  of targeting military, defense, aviation, IT companies, and legal firms in Central Asian countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan.

Interpol on Monday announced the arrest of three suspected global scammers in Nigeria for using remote access trojans (RATs) such as Agent Tesla to facilitate malware-enabled cyber fraud.  "The men are thought to have used the RAT to reroute financial transactions, stealing confidential online connection details from corporate organizations, including oil and gas companies in South East Asia, the Middle East and North Africa," the International Criminal Police Organization  said  in a statement.   One of the scammers in question, named Hendrix Omorume, has been charged and convicted of three counts of financial fraud and has been sentenced to a 12-month prison term. The two other suspects are still on trial.  The three Nigerian individuals, who are aged between 31 and 38, have been apprehended for being in possession of fake documents such as fraudulent invoices and forged official letters.

Microsoft on Monday published guidance for a newly discovered  zero-day security flaw  in its Office productivity suite that could be exploited to achieve code execution on affected systems.  The weakness, now assigned the identifier  CVE-2022-30190 , is rated 7.8 out of 10 for severity on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system. Microsoft Office versions Office 2013, Office 2016, Office 2019, and Office 2021, as well as Professional Plus editions, are impacted.   "To help protect customers, we've published CVE-2022-30190 and additional guidance  here ," a Microsoft spokesperson told The Hacker News in an emailed statement.   The  Follina  vulnerability, which came to light late last week, involved a real-world exploit that leveraged the shortcoming in a weaponized Word document to execute arbitrary PowerShell code by making use of the "ms-msdt:" URI scheme. The sample was uploaded to VirusTotal from Belarus.  But first signs of exploitation of the flaw date back

It's no secret that 3rd party apps can boost productivity, enable remote and hybrid work and are overall, essential in building and scaling a company's work processes.   An innocuous process much like clicking on an attachment was in the earlier days of email, people don't think twice when connecting an app they need with their Google workspace or M365 environment, etc. Simple actions that users take, from creating an email to updating a contact in the CRM, can result in several other automatic actions and notifications in the connected platforms.   As seen in the image below, the OAuth mechanism makes it incredibly easy to interconnect apps and many don't consider what the possible ramifications could be. When these apps and other add-ons for SaaS platforms ask for permissions' access, they are usually granted without a second thought, presenting more opportunities for bad actors to gain access to a company's data. This puts companies at risk for supply chain

A nascent Linux-based botnet named Enemybot  has expanded its capabilities to include recently disclosed security vulnerabilities in its arsenal to target web servers, Android devices, and content management systems (CMS).  "The malware is rapidly adopting one-day vulnerabilities as part of its exploitation capabilities," AT&T Alien Labs  said  in a technical write-up published last week. "Services such as VMware Workspace ONE, Adobe ColdFusion, WordPress, PHP Scriptcase and more are being targeted as well as IoT and Android devices."  First disclosed by  Securonix  in March and later by  Fortinet , Enemybot has been linked to a threat actor tracked as Keksec (aka Kek Security, Necro, and FreakOut), with early attacks targeting routers from Seowon Intech, D-Link, and iRZ.   Enemybot, which is capable of carrying out  DDoS attacks , draws its origins from several other botnets like Mirai, Qbot, Zbot, Gafgyt, and LolFMe. An analysis of the latest variant reveals

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a zero-day flaw in Microsoft Office that could be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution on affected Windows systems.  The vulnerability came to light after an independent cybersecurity research team known as nao_sec uncovered a Word document (" 05-2022-0438.doc ") that was uploaded to VirusTotal from an IP address in Belarus.  "It uses Word's external link to load the HTML and then uses the 'ms-msdt' scheme to execute PowerShell code," the researchers  noted  in a series of tweets last week.   According to security researcher Kevin Beaumont, who dubbed the flaw "Follina," the maldoc leverages Word's  remote template  feature to fetch an HTML file from a server, which then makes use of the "ms-msdt://" URI scheme to run the malicious payload.  The shortcoming has been so named because the malicious sample references 0438, which is the area code of Follina, a municipality in t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new ransomware strain called  GoodWill  that compels victims into donating for social causes and provide financial assistance to people in need.  "The ransomware group propagates very unusual demands in exchange for the decryption key," researchers from CloudSEK  said  in a report published last week. "The Robin Hood-like group claims to be interested in helping the less fortunate, rather than extorting victims for financial motivations."   Written in .NET, the ransomware was first identified by the India-based cybersecurity firm in March 2022, with the infections rendering sensitive files inaccessible without decrypting them. The malware, which makes use of the  AES algorithm  for encryption, is also notable for sleeping for 722.45 seconds to interfere with dynamic analysis.  The encryption process is followed by displaying a multiple-paged ransom note that requires the victims to carry out three socially-driven activitie

Network credentials and virtual private network (VPN) access for colleges and universities based in the U.S. are being advertised for sale on underground and public criminal marketplaces.  "This exposure of sensitive credential and network access information, especially privileged user accounts, could lead to subsequent cyber attacks against individual users or affiliated organizations," the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  said  in an advisory published last week.   The cyber intrusions against educational institutions involve threat actors leveraging tactics like spear-phishing and ransomware to carry out credential harvesting activities. The gathered credentials are then exfiltrated and sold on Russian cybercrime forums for prices ranging from a few to thousands of U.S. dollars.  Armed with this login information, the agency pointed out, adversaries can proceed to conduct brute-force  credential stuffing  attacks to break into victim accounts spanning different

A 37-year-old man from New York has been sentenced to four years in prison for buying stolen credit card information and working in cahoots with a cybercrime cartel known as the Infraud Organization.  John Telusma, who went by the alias "Peterelliot," pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy on October 13, 2021. He joined the gang in August 2011 and remained a member for five-and-a-half years.  "Telusma was among the most prolific and active members of the Infraud Organization, purchasing and fraudulently using compromised credit card numbers for his own personal gain," the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ)  said .   Infraud, a transnational cybercrime behemoth, operated for more than seven years, advertising its activities under the slogan "In Fraud We Trust," before its online infrastructure was dismantled by U.S. law enforcement authorities in February 2018.  The rogue enterprise dabbled in the large-scale acquisition and sale of compromised

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Four high severity vulnerabilities have been disclosed in a framework used by pre-installed Android System apps with millions of downloads.  The issues, now fixed by its Israeli developer MCE Systems, could have potentially allowed threat actors to stage remote and local attacks or be abused as vectors to obtain sensitive information by taking advantage of their extensive system privileges.  "As it is with many of pre-installed or default applications that most Android devices come with these days, some of the affected apps cannot be fully uninstalled or disabled without gaining root access to the device," the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team  said  in a report published Friday.   The weaknesses, which range from command-injection to local privilege escalation, have been assigned the identifiers CVE-2021-42598, CVE-2021-42599, CVE-2021-42600, and CVE-2021-42601, with CVSS scores between 7.0 and 8.9.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a recently patched critical remote code execution vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine used in Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.  The issue relates to a case of use-after-free in the instruction optimization component, successful exploitation of which could "allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser."  The flaw, which  was identified  in the Dev channel version of Chrome 101, was reported to Google by Weibo Wang, a security researcher at Singapore cybersecurity company  Numen Cyber Technology  and has since been quietly fixed by the company.   "This vulnerability occurs in the instruction selection stage, where the wrong instruction has been selected and resulting in memory access exception," Wang said .  Use-after-free flaws  occur  when previous-freed memory is accessed, inducing undefined behavior and causing a program to crash, use corrupted data, or even achieve execution

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have demonstrated what they call the "first active contactless attack against capacitive touchscreens."  GhostTouch , as it's called, "uses electromagnetic interference (EMI) to inject fake touch points into a touchscreen without the need to physically touch it," a group of academics from Zhejiang University and Technical University of Darmstadt  said  in a new research paper.  The core idea is to take advantage of the electromagnetic signals to execute basic touch events such as taps and swipes into targeted locations of the touchscreen with the goal of taking over remote control and manipulating the underlying device.   The attack, which works from a distance of up to 40mm, hinges on the fact that  capacitive touchscreens  are sensitive to EMI, leveraging it to inject electromagnetic signals into transparent electrodes that are built into the touchscreen so as to register them as touch events.  The experimental setup  involves an electrostatic gun

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Quanta Cloud Technology (QCT) servers have been identified as vulnerable to the severe "Pantsdown" Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) flaw, according to new research published today.  "An attacker running code on a vulnerable QCT server would be able to 'hop' from the server host to the BMC and move their attacks to the server management network, possibly continue and obtain further permissions to other BMCs on the network and by doing that gaining access to other servers," firmware and hardware security firm Eclypsium  said .  A baseboard management controller is a specialized system used for remote monitoring and management of servers, including controlling low-level hardware settings as well as installing firmware and software updates.   Tracked as  CVE-2019-6260  (CVSS score: 9.8), the  critical security flaw  came to light in January 2019 and relates to a case of arbitrary read and write access to the BMC's physical address space, resulting in a

Experts Warn of Rise in ChromeLoader Malware Hijacking Users' Browsers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/experts-warn-of-rise-in-chromeloader.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malvertising threat is witnessing a new surge in activity since its emergence earlier this year.  Dubbed ChromeLoader , the malware is a "pervasive and persistent browser hijacker that modifies its victims' browser settings and redirects user traffic to advertisement websites," Aedan Russell of Red Canary  said  in a new report.  ChromeLoader is a rogue Chrome browser extension and is typically distributed in the form of ISO files via pay-per-install sites and baited social media posts that advertise QR codes to cracked video games and pirated movies.   While it primarily functions by hijacking user search queries to Google, Yahoo, and Bing and redirecting traffic to an advertising site, it's also notable for its use of PowerShell to inject itself into the browser and get the extension added.   The malware, also known as Choziosi Loader, was first documented by G DATA earlier this February.   "For now the only purpose is getting revenue via unsolicited adverti

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a free-to-use browser automation framework that's being increasingly used by threat actors as part of their attack campaigns.  "The framework contains numerous features which we assess may be utilized in the enablement of malicious activities," researchers from Team Cymru  said  in a new report published Wednesday.  "The technical entry bar for the framework is purposefully kept low, which has served to create an active community of content developers and contributors, with actors in the underground economy advertising their time for the creation of bespoke tooling."   The U.S. cybersecurity company said it observed command-and-control (C2) IP addresses associated with malware such as  Bumblebee ,  BlackGuard , and  RedLine Stealer  establishing connections to the downloads subdomain of Bablosoft ("downloads.bablosoft[.]com"), the maker of the Browser Automation Studio (BAS).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In any organization, there are certain accounts that are designated as being privileged. These privileged accounts differ from standard user accounts in that they have permission to perform actions that go beyond what standard users can do. The actions vary based on the nature of the account but can include anything from setting up new user accounts to shutting down mission-critical systems.  Privileged accounts are essential tools. Without these accounts, the IT staff would be unable to do its job. At the same time, privileged accounts can pose a serious threat to an organization's security.  Added risk of a privileged account   Imagine for a moment that a hacker manages to steal a standard user's password and is able to log in as that user. Even though the hacker would have access to certain resources at that point, they would be constrained by the user's privileges (or lack thereof). In other words, the hacker would be able to browse the Internet, open some applications, and access

The maintainers of the Tails project have issued a warning that the Tor Browser that's bundled with the operating system is unsafe to use for accessing or entering sensitive information.  "We recommend that you stop using Tails until the release of 5.1 (May 31) if you use Tor Browser for sensitive information (passwords, private messages, personal information, etc.)," the project  said  in an advisory issued this week.  Tails, short for The Amnesic Incognito Live System, is a security-oriented Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at preserving privacy and anonymity by connecting to the internet through the Tor network.   The alert comes as Mozilla on May 20, 2022 rolled out fixes for  two critical zero-day flaws  in its Firefox browser, a modified version of which acts as the foundation of the Tor Browser.  Tracked as CVE-2022-1802 and CVE-2022-1529, the two vulnerabilities are what's referred to as  prototype pollution  that could be weaponized to gain JavaScript c

Twitter, which is in the process of being acquired by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has agreed to pay $150 million to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to settle allegations that it abused non-public information collected for security purposes to serve targeted ads.  In addition to the monetary penalty for "misrepresenting its privacy and security practices," the company has been banned from profiting from the deceptively collected data and ordered to notify all affected users.  "Twitter obtained data from users on the pretext of harnessing it for security purposes but then ended up also using the data to target users with ads," FTC Chair Lina M. Khan  said  in a statement. "This practice affected more than 140 million Twitter users, while boosting Twitter's primary source of revenue."

A year-long international investigation has resulted in the arrest of the suspected head of the SilverTerrier cybercrime group by the Nigeria Police Force.  "The suspect is alleged to have run a transnational cybercrime syndicate that launched mass phishing campaigns and business email compromise schemes targeting companies and individual victims," Interpol  said  in a statement.   Operation Delilah, as the coordinated international effort is called, involved tracking the 37-year-old Nigerian man's physical movements, before he was apprehended at Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos.  Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity company Group-IB said  it provided threat intelligence that led to the arrest as part of the police operation that commenced in May 2021.

Lumos System Can Find Hidden Cameras and IoT Devices in Your Airbnb or Hotel Room<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/lumos-system-can-find-hidden-cameras.html"> Full Text</a>

A group of academics has devised a system that can be used on a phone or a laptop to identify and locate Wi-Fi-connected hidden IoT devices in unfamiliar physical spaces.  With hidden cameras being  increasingly   used  to  snoop  on  individuals  in hotel rooms and Airbnbs, the goal is to be able to pinpoint such rogue devices without much of a hassle.  The system, dubbed Lumos , is designed with this intent in mind and to "visualize their presence using an augmented reality interface,"  said  Rahul Anand Sharma, Elahe Soltanaghaei, Anthony Rowe, and Vyas Sekar of Carnegie Mellon University in a new paper.   At its core, the platform works by snuffing and collecting encrypted wireless packets over the air to detect and identify concealed devices. Subsequently, it estimates the location of each identified device with respect to the user as they walk around the perimeter of the space.  The localization module, for its part, combines signal strength measurements that are avail

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
If one word could sum up the 2021 infosecurity year (well, actually three), it would be these: "supply chain attack".   A software supply chain attack happens when hackers manipulate the code in third-party software components to compromise the 'downstream' applications that use them. In 2021, we have seen a dramatic rise in such attacks: high profile security incidents like the SolarWinds, Kaseya, and  Codecov  data breaches have shaken enterprise's confidence in the security practices of third-party service providers.  What does this have to do with secrets, you might ask? In short, a lot. Take the Codecov case (we'll go back to it quickly): it is a textbook example to illustrate how hackers leverage hardcoded credentials to gain initial access into their victims' systems and harvest more secrets down the chain.   Secrets-in-code remains one of the most overlooked vulnerabilities in the application security space, despite being a priority target in hack

Malicious actors can gain unauthorized access to users' online accounts via a new technique called "account pre-hijacking," new research has found.  The attack takes aim at the account creation process that's ubiquitous in websites and other online platforms, enabling an adversary to perform a set of actions before an unsuspecting victim creates an account in a target service.  The study was led by independent security researcher Avinash Sudhodanan in collaboration with Andrew Paverd of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).  Pre-hijacking banks on the prerequisite that an attacker is already in possession of a unique identifier associated with a victim, such as an email address or phone number, which can be obtained either from the target's social media accounts or credential dumps circulating on the web.   The attacks can then play out in five different ways, including the use of the same email address during account creation by both the adversary and t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown advanced persistent threat (APT) group has been linked to a series of spear-phishing attacks targeting Russian government entities since the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war in late February 2022.  "The campaigns [...] are designed to implant a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that can be used to surveil the computers it infects, and run commands on them remotely," Malwarebytes  said  in a technical report published Tuesday.  The cybersecurity company attributed the attacks with low confidence to a Chinese hacking group, citing infrastructure overlaps between the RAT and Sakula Rat malware used by a threat actor known as  Deep Panda .  The attack chains, while leveraging different lures over the course of two months, all employed the same malware barring small differences in the source code.   The campaign is said to have commenced around February 26, days after Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, with the emails distributing the RAT under the guise of an interac

Security incidents occur. It's not a matter of "if," but of "when." That's why you implemented security products and procedures to optimize the incident response (IR) process.  However, many security pros who are doing an excellent job in handling incidents find effectively communicating the ongoing process with their management a much more challenging task.  Feels familiar?  In many organizations, leadership is not security savvy, and they aren't interested in the details regarding all the bits and bytes in which the security pro masters.   Luckily, there is a template that security leads can use when presenting to management. It's called the  IR Reporting for Management template , providing CISOs and CIOs with a clear and intuitive tool to report both the ongoing IR process and its conclusion.  The IR Reporting for Management template enables CISOs and CIOs to communicate with the two key points that management cares about—assurance that the incid

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Two trojanized Python and PHP packages have been uncovered in what's yet another instance of a software supply chain attack targeting the open source ecosystem.  One of the packages in question is "ctx," a Python module available in the PyPi repository. The other involves "phpass," a PHP package that's been forked on GitHub to distribute a rogue update.  "In both cases the attacker appears to have taken over packages that have not been updated in a while," the SANS Internet Storm Center (ISC)  said , one of whose volunteer incident handlers, Yee Ching, analyzed the ctx package.  It's worth noting that ctx was last published to PyPi on December 19, 2014. On the other hand, phpass hasn't received an update since it was uploaded to Packagist on August 31, 2012.  The malicious Python package, which was pushed to PyPi on May 21, 2022, has been  removed from the repository , but the PHP library still continues to be  available  on GitHub.   In b

SIM-based Authentication Aims to Transform Device Binding Security to End Phishing<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/sim-based-authentication-aims-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Let's face it: we all use email, and we all use passwords. Passwords create inherent vulnerability in the system. The success rate of phishing attacks is  skyrocketing , and opportunities for the attack have greatly multiplied as lives moved online. All it takes is one password to be compromised for all other users to become victims of a data breach.   To deliver additional security, therefore, digital identities rely on verification plasters. MFA (multi-factor authentication) often falls back to knowledge factors such as password resets and OTP codes, but these are still vulnerable. As long as credentials can be shared or intercepted, they can be misused.   What is needed is a paradigm shift – from knowledge-based credentials to strong possession-factor security that can't be compromised, alongside other verification security such as biometrics.  A new possession-factor API now aims to do precisely that, replacing knowledge-based credentials, by using the SIM card for possess

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of the latest version of the Chaos ransomware line, dubbed Yashma.  "Though Chaos ransomware builder has only been in the wild for a year, Yashma claims to be the sixth version (v6.0) of this malware," BlackBerry research and intelligence team said in a report  shared with The Hacker News.  Chaos is a customizable ransomware builder that  emerged  in underground forums on June 9, 2021, by falsely marketing itself as the .NET version of Ryuk despite sharing no such overlaps with the notorious counterpart.  The fact that it's offered for sale also means that any malicious actor can purchase the builder and develop their own ransomware strains, turning it into a potent threat.  It has since undergone five successive iterations aimed at improving its functionalities: version 2.0 on June 17, version 3.0 on July 5, version 4.0 on August 5, and version 5.0 in early 2022.   While the first three variants of Chaos functioned more l

In this day and age, we are not dealing with roughly pieced together, homebrew type of viruses anymore. Malware is an industry, and professional developers are found to exchange, be it by stealing one's code or deliberate collaboration. Attacks are multi-layer these days, with diverse sophisticated software apps taking over different jobs along the attack-chain from initial compromise to ultimate data exfiltration or encryption. The specific tools for each stage are highly specialized and can often be rented as a service, including customer support and subscription models for professional (ab)use. Obviously, this has largely increased both the availability and the potential effectiveness and impact of malware. Sound scary?   Well, it does, but the apparent professionalization actually does have some good sides too. One factor is that certain reused modules commonly found in malware can be used to identify, track, and analyze professional attack software. Ultimately this means that

Even as the operators of Conti threatened to  overthrow the Costa Rican government , the notorious cybercrime gang officially took down their infrastructure in favor of migrating their criminal activities to other ancillary operations, including Karakurt and BlackByte.

"However, this does not mean that the threat actors themselves are retiring."  The voluntary termination, with the exception of its name-and-shame blog, is said to have occurred on May 19, 2022, while an organizational rejig was happening simultaneously to ensure a smooth transition of the ransomware group's members.

Threat actors behind web skimming campaigns are leveraging malicious JavaScript code that mimics Google Analytics and Meta Pixel scripts in an attempt to sidestep detection.  "It's a shift from earlier tactics where attackers conspicuously injected malicious scripts into e-commerce platforms and content management systems (CMSs) via vulnerability exploitation, making this threat highly evasive to traditional security solutions," Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team  said  in a new report.  Skimming attacks, such as those by Magecart, are carried out with the goal of harvesting and exporting users' payment information, such as credit card details, entered into online payment forms in e-commerce platforms, typically during the checkout process.   This is achieved by taking advantage of security vulnerabilities in third-party plugins and other tools to inject rogue JavaScript code into the online portals without the owners' knowledge.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Containers revolutionized the development process, acting as a cornerstone for DevOps initiatives, but containers bring complex security risks that are not always obvious. Organizations that don't mitigate these risks are vulnerable to attack.   In this article, we outline how containers contributed to agile development, which unique security risks containers bring into the picture – and what organizations can do to secure containerized workloads, going beyond DevOps to achieve  DevSecOps .  Why did containers catch on so fast?  Containers are, in many ways, the evolution of virtualization. The goal was to speed up the development process, creating a more agile route from development through to testing and implementation – a method that's more lightweight than using full-blown virtual machines, anyway.  At the core of this issue is application compatibility, as applications require certain versions of libraries – which could clash with the requirements of other applications. Container

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Fronton, a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet that came to light in March 2020, is much more powerful than previously thought, per the latest research.  "Fronton is a system developed for coordinated inauthentic behavior on a massive scale," threat intelligence firm Nisos said in a  report  published last week.  "This system includes a web-based dashboard known as SANA that enables a user to formulate and deploy trending social media events en masse. The system creates these events that it refers to as Инфоповоды, 'newsbreaks,' utilizing the botnet as a geographically distributed transport."  The existence of Fronton, an IoT botnet, became public knowledge following revelations from  BBC Russia  and  ZDNet  in March 2020 after a Russian hacker group known as Digital Revolution published documents that it claimed were obtained after breaking into a subcontractor to the FSB, the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security researcher claims to have discovered an unpatched vulnerability in PayPal's money transfer service that could allow attackers to trick victims into unknowingly completing attacker-directed transactions with a single click.  Clickjacking, also called UI redressing, refers to a technique wherein an unwitting user is tricked into clicking seemingly innocuous webpage elements like buttons with the goal of downloading malware, redirecting to malicious websites, or disclose sensitive information.   This is typically achieved by displaying an invisible page or HTML element on top of the visible page, resulting in a scenario where users are fooled into thinking that they are clicking the legitimate page when they are in fact clicking the rogue element overlaid atop it.  "Thus, the attacker is 'hijacking' clicks meant for [the legitimate] page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain, or both," security researcher h4x0r

At least two research institutes located in Russia and a third likely target in Belarus have been at the receiving end of an espionage attack by a Chinese nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT).  The attacks, codenamed " Twisted Panda ," come in the backdrop of Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, prompting a  wide range  of  threat actors  to swiftly adapt their campaigns on the ongoing conflict to distribute malware and stage opportunistic attacks.  They have materialized in the form of social engineering schemes with topical war and sanctions-themed baits orchestrated to trick potential victims into clicking malicious links or opening weaponized documents.  Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point, which  disclosed  details of the latest intelligence-gathering operation, attributed it a Chinese threat actor, with connections to that of  Stone Panda  (aka  APT 10 , Cicada, or Potassium) and  Mustang Panda  (aka Bronze President, HoneyMyte, or RedDelta).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple versions of a WordPress plugin by the name of "School Management Pro" harbored a backdoor that could grant an adversary complete control over vulnerable websites.  The issue, spotted in premium versions before 9.9.7, has been assigned the CVE identifier  CVE-2022-1609  and is rated 10 out of 10 for severity.  The backdoor, which is believed to have existed since version 8.9, enables "an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on sites with the plugin installed," Jetpack's Harald Eilertsen  said  in a Friday write-up.   School Management, developed by an India-based company called  Weblizar , is billed as a Wordpress add-on to "manage complete school operation." It also claims more than 340,000 customers of its premium and free WordPress themes and plugins.  The WordPress security company noted that it uncovered the implant on May 4 after it was alerted to the presence of heavily obfuscated code in the license-checking code of t

Cisco on Friday rolled out fixes for a medium-severity vulnerability affecting IOS XR Software that it said has been exploited in real-world attacks.  Tracked as CVE-2022-20821 (CVSS score: 6.5), the issue relates to an open port vulnerability that could be abused by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to connect to a Redis instance and achieve code execution.  "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write to the Redis in-memory database, write arbitrary files to the container filesystem, and retrieve information about the Redis database," Cisco  said  in an advisory.   "Given the configuration of the sandboxed container that the Redis instance runs in, a remote attacker would be unable to execute remote code or abuse the integrity of the Cisco IOS XR Software host system."  The flaw, which it said was identified during the resolution of a technical assistance center (TAC) case, impacts Cisco 8000 Series routers running IOS XR Software that has the health

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Linux botnet malware known as XorDdos  has witnessed a 254% surge in activity over the last six months, according to latest research from Microsoft.  The trojan, so named for carrying out denial-of-service attacks on Linux systems and its use of XOR-based encryption for communications with its command-and-control (C2) server, is  known  to have been  active  since at least 2014.  "XorDdos' modular nature provides attackers with a versatile trojan capable of infecting a variety of Linux system architectures," Ratnesh Pandey, Yevgeny Kulakov, and Jonathan Bar Or of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team  said  in an exhaustive deep-dive of the malware.   "Its SSH brute-force attacks are a relatively simple yet effective technique for gaining root access over a number of potential targets."  Remote control over vulnerable IoT and other internet-connected devices is gained by means of secure shell (SSH) brute-force attacks, enabling the malware to form a botnet

Cytrox's Predator Spyware Targeted Android Users with Zero-Day Exploits<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/cytroxs-predator-spyware-target-android.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) on Thursday pointed fingers at a North Macedonian spyware developer named Cytrox for developing exploits against five zero-day (aka 0-day) flaws, four in Chrome and one in Android, to target Android users.  "The 0-day exploits were used alongside n-day exploits as the developers took advantage of the time difference between when some critical bugs were patched but not flagged as security issues and when these patches were fully deployed across the Android ecosystem," TAG researchers Clement Lecigne and Christian Resell  said .  Cytrox is alleged to have packaged the exploits and sold them to different government-backed actors located in Egypt, Armenia, Greece, Madagascar, Côte d'Ivoire, Serbia, Spain, and Indonesia, who, in turn, weaponized the bugs in at least three different campaigns.  The commercial surveillance company is the maker of  Predator , an implant  analogous  to that of NSO Group's  Pegasus , and is known to hav

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A case of software supply chain attack has been observed in the Rust programming language's  crate registry  that leveraged typosquatting techniques to publish a rogue library containing malware.  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne dubbed the attack " CrateDepression ."  Typosquatting attacks  take place  when an adversary mimics the name of a popular package on a public registry in hopes that developers will accidentally download the malicious package instead of the legitimate library.   In this case, the crate in question is "rustdecimal," a typosquat of the real " rust_decimal " package that's been downloaded over 3.5 million times to date. The package was  flagged  earlier this month on May 3 by Askar Safin, a Moscow-based developer.  According to an  advisory  published by the Rust maintainers, the crate is said to have been first pushed on March 25, 2022, attracting fewer than 500 downloads before it was permanently removed from the repository.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The North Korea-backed Lazarus Group has been observed leveraging the  Log4Shell vulnerability  in VMware Horizon servers to deploy the NukeSped  (aka Manuscrypt) implant against targets located in its southern counterpart.  "The attacker used the Log4j vulnerability on VMware Horizon products that were not applied with the security patch," AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)  said  in a new report.   The intrusions are said to have been first discovered in April, although  multiple threat actors , including those aligned with  China  and  Iran , have employed the same approach to further their objectives over the past few months.   NukeSped is a backdoor that can perform various malicious activities based on commands received from a remote attacker-controlled domain. Last year, Kaspersky disclosed a spear-phishing campaign aimed at stealing critical data from defense companies using a NukeSped variant called  ThreatNeedle .  Some of the key functions of the bac

"These variants of Vidar malware fetch the C2 configuration from attacker-controlled social media channels hosted on Telegram and Mastodon network."  Some of the rogue distribution vector domains, which were registered last month on April 20, consist of ms-win11[.]com, win11-serv[.]com, and win11install[.]com, and ms-teams-app[.]net.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A novel Bluetooth relay attack can let cybercriminals more easily than ever remotely  unlock and operate cars ,  break open residential smart locks , and breach secure areas.  The vulnerability has to do with weaknesses in the current implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a wireless technology used for authenticating Bluetooth devices that are physically located within a close range.   "An attacker can falsely indicate the proximity of Bluetooth LE (BLE) devices to one another through the use of a relay attack," U.K.-based cybersecurity company NCC Group  said . "This may enable unauthorized access to devices in BLE-based proximity authentication systems."  Relay attacks , also called two-thief attacks, are a variation of person-in-the-middle attacks in which an adversary intercepts communication between two parties, one of whom is also an attacker, and then relays it to the target device without any manipulation.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google last month addressed a high-severity flaw in its OAuth client library for Java that could be abused by a malicious actor with a compromised token to deploy arbitrary payloads.  Tracked as  CVE-2021-22573 , the vulnerability is rated 8.7 out of 10 for severity and relates to an authentication bypass in the library that stems from an improper verification of the cryptographic signature.  Credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on March 12 is  Tamjid Al Rahat , a fourth-year Ph.D. student of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, who has been awarded $5,000 as part of Google's bug bounty program.   "The vulnerability is that the IDToken verifier does not verify if the token is properly signed," an  advisory  for the flaw reads.  "Signature verification makes sure that the token's payload comes from a valid provider, not from someone else. An attacker can provide a compromised token with custom payload. The token will pass the validation on

A new research published by academics from KU Leuven, Radboud University, and the University of Lausanne has revealed that users' email addresses are exfiltrated to tracking, marketing, and analytics domains before such is submitted and without prior consent.  The study  involved  crawling 2.8 million pages from the top 100 websites, and found that as many as 1,844 websites allowed trackers to capture email addresses before form submission in the European Union, a number that jumped to 2,950 when the same set of websites were visited from the U.S.  "Emails (or their hashes) were sent to 174 distinct domains ( eTLD+1 ) in the U.S. crawl, and 157 distinct domains in the EU crawl," the researchers  said . Furthermore, 52 websites were determined to be collecting passwords in the same manner, an issue that has since been addressed following responsible disclosure.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware has issued patches to contain  two security flaws  impacting Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager, and vRealize Automation that could be exploited to backdoor enterprise networks.  The first of the two flaws, tracked as CVE-2022-22972 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns an authentication bypass that could enable an actor with network access to the UI to gain administrative access without prior authentication.  CVE-2022-22973 (CVSS score: 7.8), the other bug, is a case of local privilege escalation that could enable an attacker with local access to elevate privileges to the "root" user on vulnerable virtual appliances.  "It is extremely important that you quickly take steps to patch or mitigate these issues in on-premises deployments," VMware  said .   The disclosure follows a  warning  from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are exploiting CVE-2022-22954 and CVE-2022-22960 — two other VMware flaws t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ransomware  is not a new attack vector. In fact, the  first malware of its kind  appeared more than 30 years ago and was distributed via 5.25-inch floppy disks. To pay the ransom, the victim had to mail money to a P.O. Box in Panama.  Fast forward to today, affordable ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) kits are available on the dark web for anyone to purchase and deploy and attackers have an infinite number of channels available to them to infiltrate organizations as a result of reliance on cloud and mobile technologies.  Initiating a ransomware attack is all about discretely gaining access. And as employees can now access your data from anywhere, you have lost visibility into how they do so. To safeguard against these attacks, you're not just looking for malware, you need continuous insights into your users, the endpoints they use and the applications and data they access.

The inner workings of a cybercriminal group known as the Wizard Spider have been exposed, shedding light on its organizational structure and motivations.  "Most of Wizard Spider's efforts go into hacking European and U.S. businesses, with a special cracking tool used by some of their attackers to breach high-value targets," Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT  said  in a new report shared with The Hacker News. "Some of the money they get is put back into the project to develop new tools and talent."  Wizard Spider, also known as Gold Blackburn, is believed to operate out of Russia and refers to a financially motivated threat actor that's been linked to the TrickBot botnet, a modular malware that was  officially discontinued  earlier this year in favor of improved malware such as BazarBackdoor.   That's not all. The TrickBot operators have also extensively cooperated with  Conti , another Russia-linked cybercrime group notorious for offering ransomware-a

Hackers Gain Fileless Persistence on Targeted SQL Servers Using a Built-in Utility<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/hackers-gain-fileless-persistence-on.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Tuesday warned that it recently spotted a malicious campaign targeting SQL Servers that leverages a built-in PowerShell binary to achieve persistence on compromised systems.  The intrusions, which leverage brute-force attacks as an initial compromise vector, stand out for their use of the utility " sqlps.exe ," the tech giant  said  in a series of tweets.  The ultimate goals of the campaign are unknown, as is the identity of the threat actor staging it. Microsoft is tracking the malware under the name " SuspSQLUsage ."   The sqlps.exe utility, which comes by default with all versions of SQL Servers, enables an SQL Agent — a Windows service to run scheduled tasks — to run jobs using the PowerShell subsystem.  "The attackers achieve fileless persistence by spawning the sqlps.exe utility, a PowerShell wrapper for running SQL-built cmdlets, to run recon commands and change the start mode of the SQL service to LocalSystem," Microsoft noted.

To cash in on a thriving market, a managed security service provider (MSSP) must navigate unprecedented competition and complex challenges. The good news is that demand is through the roof. 69% of organizations plan to boost spending on cybersecurity in 2022.   The bad news is that everyone wants a piece of the pie. MSSPs must outshine each other while fending off encroachments by traditional IT vendors and MSPs. As a result, some MSSPs are succumbing to the squeeze of low margins. Others are struggling to scale successfully.   The most successful MSSPs are taking action to improve their current financial position while laying a foundation for long-term growth. A new eBook, " Your 90-Day MSSP Plan: How to Improve Margins and Scale Up Service Delivery ," to help MSSPs understand the current cybersecurity landscape, their current position in it, what you they're well, and where they can improve the most.   This nine-step plan offers a clear path for MSSPs to boost profitab

Highly skilled software and mobile app developers from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are posing as "non-DPRK nationals" in hopes of landing freelance employment in an attempt to enable the regime's  malicious cyber intrusions .  That's according to a  joint advisory  from the U.S. Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued on Monday.  Targets include financial, health, social media, sports, entertainment, and lifestyle-focused companies located in North America, Europe, and East Asia, with most of the dispatched workers situated in China, Russia, Africa, and Southeast Asia.  The goal, the U.S. agencies warn, is to generate a constant stream of revenue that sidesteps international sanctions imposed on the nation and help serve its economic and security priorities, including the development of nuclear and ballistic missiles.

Microsoft is warning of an emerging threat targeting internet-connected cryptocurrency wallets, signaling a departure in the use of digital coins in cyberattacks.  The tech giant dubbed the new threat "cryware," with the attacks resulting in the irreversible theft of virtual currencies by means of fraudulent transfers to an adversary-controlled wallet.  "Cryware are information stealers that collect and exfiltrate data directly from non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets, also known as  hot wallets ," Berman Enconado and Laurie Kirk of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team  said  in a new report.   "Because hot wallets, unlike custodial wallets, are stored locally on a device and provide easier access to cryptographic keys needed to perform transactions, more and more threats are targeting them."   Attacks of this kind are not theoretical. Earlier this year, Kaspersky  disclosed  a financially-motivated campaign staged by the North Korea-based Lazarus Gr

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious Conti ransomware gang, which last month staged an attack on Costa Rican administrative systems, has threatened to "overthrow" the new government of the country.  "We are determined to overthrow the government by means of a cyber attack, we have already shown you all the strength and power," the group said on its official website. "We have our insiders in your government. We are also working on gaining access to your other systems, you have no other options but to pay us."  In a further attempt to increase pressure, the Russian-speaking cybercrime syndicate has raised its ransom demand to $20 million in return for a decryption key to unlock their systems.  Another message posted on its dark web portal over the weekend issued a warning stating it will delete the decryption keys in a week, a move that would make it impossible for Costa Rica to recover access to the files encrypted by the ransomware.

UpdateAgent Returns with New macOS Malware Dropper Written in Swift<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/updateagent-returns-with-new-macos.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new variant of the macOS malware tracked as UpdateAgent has been spotted in the wild, indicating ongoing attempts on the part of its authors to upgrade its functionalities.  "Perhaps one of the most identifiable features of the malware is that it relies on the AWS infrastructure to host its various payloads and perform its infection status updates to the server," researchers from Jamf Threat Labs  said  in a report.   UpdateAgent, first detected in late 2020, has since  evolved  into a malware dropper, facilitating the distribution of second-stage payloads such as adware while also bypassing macOS  Gatekeeper  protections.   The newly discovered Swift-based dropper masquerades as Mach-O binaries named " PDFCreator " and " ActiveDirectory " that, upon execution, establish a connection to a remote server and retrieve a bash script to be executed.   "The primary difference [between the two executables] is that it reaches out to a different URL from wh

Traditional businesses migrating to the cloud need robust information security mechanisms.  Gartner predicts  that more than 95% of new digital workloads will continue to be deployed on cloud-native platforms by 2025.  Robust  cloud data security  is imperative for businesses adopting rapid digital transformation to the cloud. While a traditional hosting model could be considered more secure, not all organizations are receptive to relinquishing control over their infrastructure or applications by relying on a cloud provider at an increased risk of data theft from a cyberattack done by an outsider.  Having said so, let's try to understand the vital part.  What is Cloud Data Security?   Cloud data security entails securing data, whether at rest or in motion, on cloud-based infrastructure, applications, etc., against cyber threats like data breaches, unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, etc.  This includes the technologies, policies, controls, and services to protect cloud-based system

The U.S. Justice Department on Monday accused a 55-year-old cardiologist from Venezuela of being the mastermind behind  Thanos ransomware , charging him with the use and sale of the malicious tool and entering into profit sharing arrangements.  Moises Luis Zagala Gonzalez, also known by the monikers Nosophoros, Aesculapius, and Nebuchadnezzar, is alleged to have both developed and marketed the ransomware to other cybercriminals to facilitate the intrusions and get a share of the bitcoin payment.  If convicted, Zagala faces up to five years' imprisonment for attempted computer intrusion, and five years' imprisonment for conspiracy to commit computer intrusions.    "The multi-tasking doctor treated patients, created and  named his cyber tool after death , profited from a global ransomware ecosystem in which he sold the tools for conducting ransomware attacks, trained the attackers about how to extort victims, and then boasted about successful attacks, including by malicious

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning of a new variant of the srv botnet  that's exploiting multiple security flaws in web applications and databases to install coin miners on both Windows and Linux systems.  The tech giant, which has called the new version Sysrv-K , is said to weaponize an  array of exploits  to gain control of web servers. The cryptojacking botnet first emerged in December 2020.  "Sysrv-K scans the internet to find web servers with various vulnerabilities to install itself," the company  said  in a series of tweets. "The vulnerabilities range from path traversal and remote file disclosure to arbitrary file download and remote code execution vulnerabilities."   This also includes  CVE-2022-22947  (CVSS score: 10.0), a code injection vulnerability in Spring Cloud Gateway that could be exploited to allow arbitrary remote execution on a remote host via a maliciously crafted request.  It's worth noting that the abuse of CVE-2022-22947 has prompted the U.S. Cyb

More than 200 Android apps masquerading as fitness, photo editing, and puzzle apps have been observed distributing spyware called Facestealer  to siphon user credentials and other valuable information.   "Similar to  Joker , another piece of mobile malware, Facestealer changes its code frequently, thus spawning many variants," Trend Micro analysts Cifer Fang, Ford Quin, and Zhengyu Dong  said  in a new report. "Since its discovery, the spyware has continuously beleaguered Google Play."  Facestealer, first  documented  by Doctor Web in July 2021, refers to a group of fraudulent apps that invade the official app marketplace for Android with the goal of plundering sensitive data such as Facebook login credentials.   Of the 200 apps, 42 are VPN services, followed by a camera (20) and photo editing applications (13). In addition to harvesting credentials, the apps are also designed to collect Facebook cookies and personally identifiable information associated with a vic

Researchers Find Potential Way to Run Malware on iPhone Even When it's OFF<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/researchers-find-way-to-run-malware-on.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A first-of-its-kind security analysis of iOS Find My function has identified a novel attack surface that makes it possible to tamper with the firmware and load malware onto a Bluetooth chip that's executed while an iPhone is "off."  The mechanism takes advantage of the fact that wireless chips related to Bluetooth, Near-field communication ( NFC ), and ultra-wideband ( UWB ) continue to operate while iOS is shut down when entering a "power reserve" Low Power Mode (LPM).  While this is done so as to enable features like  Find My  and facilitate  Express Card transactions , all the three wireless chips have direct access to the secure element, academics from the Secure Mobile Networking Lab ( SEEMOO ) at the Technical University of Darmstadt  said  in a paper.   "The Bluetooth and UWB chips are hardwired to the Secure Element (SE) in the NFC chip, storing secrets that should be available in LPM," the researchers said.  "Since LPM support is impleme

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Are you aware of fake clickjacking bug bounty reports? If not, you should be. This article will get you up to speed and help you to stay alert.  What are clickjacking bug bounty reports?  If we start by breaking up the term into its component parts, a bug bounty is a program offered by an organization, in which individuals are rewarded for finding and reporting software bugs. These programs are often used by companies as a cost-effective way to find and fix software vulnerabilities, thereby improving the security of their products. They also help to build goodwill with the security community.   For the bounty hunters (or white hat hackers), they have an opportunity to earn money and recognition for their skills.   Clickjacking is a malicious technique used to trick users into clicking on something that they think is safe, but is actually harmful. For example, a hacker could create a fake button that looks like the "like" button on a social media site. When users click on it,

An unidentified threat actor has been linked to an actively in-development malware toolkit called the "Eternity Project" that lets professional and amateur cybercriminals buy stealers, clippers, worms, miners, ransomware, and a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) bot.  What makes this malware-as-a-service (MaaS) stand out is that besides using a Telegram channel to communicate updates about the latest features, it also employs a  Telegram Bot  that enables the purchasers to build the binary.   "The [threat actors] provide an option in the Telegram channel to customize the binary features, which provides an effective way to build binaries without any dependencies," researchers from Cyble  said  in a report published last week.

The European Parliament announced a "provisional agreement" aimed at improving cybersecurity and resilience of both public and private sector entities in the European Union.  The revised directive, called " NIS2 " (short for network and information systems), is expected to replace the  existing legislation  on cybersecurity that was established in July 2016.  The revamp sets ground rules, requiring companies in energy, transport, financial markets, health, and digital infrastructure sectors to adhere to risk management measures and reporting obligations.  Among the provisions in the new legislation are flagging cybersecurity incidents to authorities within 24 hours, patching software vulnerabilities, and readying risk management measures to secure networks, failing which can incur monetary penalties.

A 28-year-old Ukrainian national has been sentenced to four years in prison for siphoning thousands of server login credentials and selling them on the dark web for monetary gain as part of a credential theft scheme.  Glib Oleksandr Ivanov-Tolpintsev , who pleaded guilty to his offenses earlier this February, was arrested in Poland in October 2020, before being  extradited to the U.S.  in September 2021.  The illegal sale involved the trafficking of login credentials to servers located across the world and personally identifiable information such as dates of birth and Social Security numbers belonging to U.S. residents on a darknet marketplace.   The unnamed site purportedly offered over 700,000 compromised servers for sale, including at least 150,000 in the U.S. alone. Believed to have been operational from around October 2014, the underground marketplace was seized by law enforcement authorities on January 24, 2019, according to court documents.

Google on Thursday  announced  the creation of a new "Open Source Maintenance Crew" to focus on bolstering the security of critical open source projects.  Additionally, the tech giant pointed out  Open Source Insights  as a tool for analyzing packages and their dependency graphs, using it to determine "whether a vulnerability in a dependency might affect your code."  "With this information, developers can understand how their software is put together and the consequences to changes in their dependencies," the company said.  The development comes as security and trust in the open source software ecosystem has been increasingly thrown into question in the aftermath of a  string  of  supply chain   attacks  designed to compromise developer workflows.   In December 2021, a critical flaw in the ubiquitous open source  Log4j logging library  left several companies scrambling to patch their systems against potential abuse.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A spear-phishing campaign targeting Jordan's foreign ministry has been observed dropping a new stealthy backdoor dubbed Saitama.  Researchers from Malwarebytes and Fortinet FortiGuard Labs  attributed  the campaign to an Iranian cyber espionage threat actor tracked under the moniker APT34, citing  resemblances  to past campaigns staged by the group.  "Like many of these attacks, the email contained a malicious attachment," Fortinet researcher Fred Gutierrez  said . "However, the attached threat was not a garden-variety malware. Instead, it had the capabilities and techniques usually associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs)."   APT34, also known as OilRig, Helix Kitten, and Cobalt Gypsy, is known to be active since at least 2014 and has a track record of striking telecom, government, defense, oil, and financial sectors in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) via targeted phishing attacks.  Earlier this February, ESET  tied  the group to a long-runni

A ransomware group with an Iranian operational connection has been linked to a string of file-encrypting malware attacks targeting organizations in Israel, the U.S., Europe, and Australia.  Cybersecurity firm Secureworks attributed the intrusions to a threat actor it tracks under the moniker Cobalt Mirage, which it said is linked to an Iranian hacking crew dubbed Cobalt Illusion (aka APT35, Charming Kitten, Newscaster, or Phosphorus).  "Elements of Cobalt Mirage activity have been  reported  as  Phosphorus  and  TunnelVision ," Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.   The threat actor is said to have conducted two different sets of intrusions, one of which relates to opportunistic ransomware attacks involving the use of legitimate tools like  BitLocker  and DiskCryptor for financial gain.

E.U. Proposes New Rules for Tech Companies to Combat Online Child Sexual Abuse<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/eu-proposes-new-rules-for-tech.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The European Commission on Wednesday proposed new regulation that would require tech companies to scan for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and grooming behavior, raising worries that it could undermine end-to-end encryption (E2EE).  To that end, online service providers, including hosting services and communication apps, are expected to proactively scan their platforms for CSAM as well as report, remove and disable access to such illicit content.  While instant messaging services like WhatsApp  already   rely  on hashed versions of known CSAM to automatically block new uploads of images or videos matching them, the new plan requires such platforms to identify and flag new instances of CSAM.  "Detection technologies must only be used for the purpose of detecting child sexual abuse," the regulator  said . "Providers will have to deploy technologies that are the least privacy-intrusive in accordance with the state of the art in the industry, and that limit the error rat

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a massive campaign that's responsible for injecting malicious JavaScript code into compromised WordPress websites that redirects visitors to scam pages and other malicious websites to generate illegitimate traffic.  "The websites all shared a common issue — malicious JavaScript had been injected within their website's files and the database, including legitimate core WordPress files," Krasimir Konov, a malware analyst at Sucuri,  said  in a report published Wednesday.   This involved infecting files such as jquery.min.js and jquery-migrate.min.js with obfuscated JavaScript that's activated on every page load, allowing the attacker to redirect the website visitors to a destination of their choice.  The GoDaddy-owned website security company said that the domains at the end of the redirect chain could be used to load advertisements, phishing pages, malware, or even trigger another set of redirects.

Google on Wednesday took to its annual developer conference to announce a host of privacy and security updates, including support for virtual credit cards on Android and Chrome.  "When you use autofill to enter your payment details at checkout, virtual cards will add an additional layer of security by replacing your actual card number with a distinct, virtual number," Google's Jen Fitzpatrick  said  in a statement.  The goal, the search giant, said to keep payment information safe and secure during online shopping and protect users from  skimming attacks  wherein threat actors inject malicious JavaScript code to plunder credit card numbers and sell them on the black market.   The feature is expected to roll out in the U.S. for Visa, American Express, Mastercard, and Capital One cards starting this summer.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In recent months, a cybercriminal gang known as LAPSUS$ has claimed responsibility for a number of high-profile attacks against technology companies, including:   T-Mobile (April 23, 2022)  Globant   Okta  Ubisoft  Samsung  Nvidia  Microsoft  Vodafone   In addition to these attacks, LAPSUS$ was also able to successfully launch a ransomware attack against the Brazilian Ministry of Health.  While high-profile cyber-attacks are certainly nothing new, there are several things that make LAPSUS$ unique.   The alleged mastermind of these attacks and several other alleged accomplices were all teenagers.  Unlike more traditional ransomware gangs, LAPSUS$ has a very strong social media presence.  The gang is best known for data exfiltration. It has stolen source code and other proprietary information and has often leaked this information on the Internet.   LAPSUS$ stolen credentials   In the case of Nvidia, for example, the  attackers gained access to hundreds of gigabytes of proprietary data ,

Government Agencies Warn of Increase in Cyberattacks Targeting MSPs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/government-agencies-warned-of-increase.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple cybersecurity authorities from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. on Wednesday released a  joint advisory  warning of threats targeting managed service providers (MSPs) and their customers.  Key among the recommendations include identifying and disabling accounts that are no longer in use, enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) on MSP accounts that access customer environments, and ensuring transparency in ownership of security roles and responsibilities.  MSPs have emerged as an attractive attack route for cybercriminals to scale their attacks, as a vulnerable provider can be weaponized as an initial access vector to breach several downstream customers at once.   The spillover effects of such intrusions, as witnessed in the wake of high-profile breaches aimed at  SolarWinds  and  Kaseya  in recent years, have once again underlined the need to secure the software supply chain.  The targeting of MSPs by malicious cyber actors in an effort to "expl

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have detailed a previously undocumented .NET-based post-exploitation framework called IceApple that has been deployed on Microsoft Exchange server instances to facilitate reconnaissance and data exfiltration.  "Suspected to be the work of a state-nexus adversary, IceApple remains under active development, with 18 modules observed in use across a number of enterprise environments, as of May 2022," CrowdStrike  said  in a Wednesday report.   The cybersecurity firm, which discovered the sophisticated malware in late 2021, noted its presence in multiple victim networks and in geographically distinct locations. Targeted victims span a wide range of sectors, including technology, academic, and government entities.  A post-exploitation toolset, as the name implies, is not used to provide initial access, but is rather employed to carry out follow-on attacks after having already compromised the hosts in question.   IceApple is notable for the fact that it's an in-memo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An espionage-focused threat actor known for targeting China, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia has expanded to set its sights on Bangladeshi government organizations as part of an ongoing campaign that commenced in August 2021.  Cybersecurity firm Cisco Talos attributed the activity with moderate confidence to a hacking group dubbed the  Bitter APT  based on overlaps in the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure with that of prior campaigns mounted by the same actor.  "Bangladesh fits the profile we have defined for this threat actor, previously targeting Southeast Asian countries including  China , Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia," Vitor Ventura, lead security researcher at Cisco Talos for EMEA and Asia, told  The Hacker News.   "And now, in this latest campaign, they have widened their reach to Bangladesh. Any new country in southeast Asia being targeted by Bitter APT shouldn't be of surprise."  Bitter (aka APT-C-08 or T-APT-17) is suspected to be a South Asian hacking

Security and IT teams are losing sleep as would-be intruders lay siege to the weakest link in any organization's digital defense: employees.

Cybercriminals find it easier to manipulate people before resorting to technical "hacking" tactics. Recent research reveals that social engineering is leveraged in 98% of attacks.  As the rapid, ongoing acceleration of remote work raises the stakes, security leaders are fighting back with education and awareness. Resources developed by experts, like this new white paper — " Social Engineering: What You Need to Know to Stay Resilient " — identify the most common tactics, track how these types of attacks are evolving, and provide tips to protect organizations and their end-users.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a number of malicious packages in the NPM registry specifically targeting a number of prominent media, logistics, and industrial firms based in Germany to carry out  supply chain attacks .  "Compared with most malware found in the NPM repository, this payload seems particularly dangerous: a highly-sophisticated, obfuscated piece of malware that acts as a backdoor and allows the attacker to take total control over the infected machine," researchers from JFrog  said  in a new report.  The DevOps company said that evidence points to it being either the work of a sophisticated threat actor or a "very aggressive" penetration test.   All the rogue packages, most of which have since been removed from the repository, have been traced to four "maintainers" - bertelsmannnpm, boschnodemodules, stihlnodemodules, and dbschenkernpm — indicating an attempt to impersonate legitimate firms like Bertelsmann, Bosch, Stihl, and DB Sc

The Five Eyes nations comprising  Australia ,  Canada ,  New Zealand ,  the U.K. , and  the U.S. , along with Ukraine and the European Union, formally pinned Russia for masterminding an attack on an international satellite communication ( SATCOM ) provider that had "spillover" effects across Europe.  The  cyber offensive , which took place one hour before the Kremlin's military invasion of Ukraine on February 24, targeted the KA-SAT satellite network operated by telecommunications company Viasat, crippling the operations of wind farms and internet users in central Europe.  Viasat, in late March,  disclosed  that it had shipped nearly 30,000 modems to distributors to restore service to customers whose modems were rendered unusable.   "This cyberattack had a significant impact causing indiscriminate communication outages and disruptions across several public authorities, businesses and users in Ukraine, as well as affecting several E.U.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious ransomware operation known as REvil (aka Sodin or Sodinokibi) has resumed after six months of inactivity, an analysis of new ransomware samples has revealed.  "Analysis of these samples indicates that the developer has access to REvil's source code, reinforcing the likelihood that the threat group has reemerged," researchers from Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)  said  in a report published Monday.  "The identification of multiple samples with varying modifications in such a short period of time and the lack of an official new version indicates that REvil is under heavy active development once again."  REvil, short for Ransomware Evil, is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) scheme and attributed to a Russia-based/speaking group known as  Gold Southfield , arising just as  GandCrab  activity declined and the latter announced their retirement.

TL;DR:   Adopt a modern, test-driven methodology for securing your organization with Detection-as-Code.  Over the past decade, threat detection has become business-critical and even more complicated. As businesses move to the cloud, manual threat detection processes are no longer able to keep up. How can teams automate security analysis at scale and address the challenges that threaten business objectives? The answer lies in treating threat detections like software or detection-as-code.  Watch Panther's On-Demand Webinar: Scaling Security with Detection-as-Code with Cedar  to find out how Cedar uses Panther to leverage Detection-as-Code to build high-signal alerts.  Detection-as-Code: A New (Hope) Paradigm Detections define logic for analyzing security log data to identify attacker behaviors. When a rule is matched, an alert gets sent to your team for containment or investigation.  What is detection-as-code?  Detection-as-Code is a modern, flexible, and structured approach to writ

Cybersecurity researchers have dissected the inner workings of an information-stealing malware called Saintstealer  that's designed to siphon credentials and system information.  "After execution, the stealer extracts username, passwords, credit card details, etc.," Cyble researchers  said  in an analysis last week. "The stealer also steals data from various locations across the system and compresses it in a password-protected ZIP file."  A 32-bit C# .NET-based executable with the name "saintgang.exe," Saintstealer is equipped with anti-analysis checks, opting to terminate itself if it's running either in a sandboxed or virtual environment.   The malware can capture a wide range of information that ranges from taking screenshots to gathering passwords, cookies, and autofill data stored in Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Opera, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, and Yandex, among others.  It can also steal Discord multi-factor authentication toke

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Monday disclosed that it mitigated a security flaw affecting Azure Synapse and Azure Data Factory that, if successfully exploited, could result in remote code execution.  The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2022-29972 , has been codenamed " SynLapse " by researchers from Orca Security, who reported the flaw to Microsoft in January 2022.   "The vulnerability was specific to the third-party Open Database Connectivity ( ODBC ) driver used to connect to Amazon Redshift in Azure Synapse pipelines and Azure Data Factory Integration Runtime ( IR ) and did not impact Azure Synapse as a whole," the company  said .  "The vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to perform remote command execution across IR infrastructure not limited to a single tenant."  In other words, a malicious actor can weaponize the bug to acquire the Azure Data Factory service certificate and access another tenant's Integration Runtimes to gain access to sensitive informa

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has proposed a penalty of nearly $1 million to Colonial Pipeline for violating federal safety regulations, worsening the impact of the ransomware attack last year.  The $986,400 penalty is the result of an inspection conducted by the regulator of the pipeline operator's control room management ( CRM ) procedures from January through November 2020.  The PHMSA  said  that "a probable failure to adequately plan and prepare for manual shutdown and restart of its pipeline system [...] contributed to the national impacts when the pipeline remained out of service after the May 2021 cyberattack."   Colonial Pipeline, operator of the largest U.S. fuel pipeline, was forced to temporarily take its systems offline in the wake of a  DarkSide ransomware attack  in early May 2021, disrupting gas supply and prompting a  regional emergency declaration  across 17 states.

The maintainers of the RubyGems package manager have addressed a critical security flaw that could have been abused to remove gems and replace them with rogue versions under specific circumstances.  "Due to a bug in the yank action, it was possible for any RubyGems.org user to remove and replace certain gems even if that user was not authorized to do so," RubyGems  said  in a security advisory published on May 6, 2022.   RubyGems, like npm for JavaScript and pip for Python, is a  package manager  and a gem hosting service for the Ruby programming language, offering a repository of more than 171,500 libraries.  In a nutshell, the flaw in question, tracked as CVE-2022-29176, enabled anyone to pull certain gems and upload different files with the same name, same version number, and different platforms.  For this to happen, however, a gem needed to have one or more dashes in its name, where the word before the dash was the name of an attacker-controlled gem, and which was create

Unless you are living completely off the grid, you know the horrifying war in Ukraine and the related geopolitical tensions have dramatically increased cyberattacks and the threat of even more to come.  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provides guidance to US federal agencies in their fight against cybercrime, and the agency's advice has proven so valuable that it's been widely adopted by commercial organizations too.  In February, CISA responded to the current situation by issuing an unusual " SHIELDS UP! " warning and advisory. According to CISA, "Every organization—large and small—must be prepared to respond to disruptive cyber incidents."  The announcement from CISA consisted of a range of recommendations to help organizations and individuals reduce the likelihood of a successful attack and limit damage in case the worst happens. It also contains general advice for C-level leaders, as well as a tip sheet on how to respond to r

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new set of trojanized apps spread via the Google Play Store has been observed distributing the notorious Joker malware on compromised Android devices.  Joker, a  repeat   offender , refers to a class of harmful apps that are used for billing and SMS fraud, while also performing a number of actions of a malicious hacker's choice, such as stealing text messages, contact lists, and device information.  Despite continued attempts on the part of Google to scale up its defenses, the apps have been continually iterated to search for gaps and slip into the app store undetected.   "They're usually spread on Google Play, where scammers download legitimate apps from the store, add malicious code to them and re-upload them to the store under a different name," Kaspersky researcher Igor Golovin  said  in a report published last week.  The trojanized apps, taking the place of their removed counterparts, often appear as messaging, health tracking, and PDF scanner apps that, once

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has warned of phishing attacks that deploy an information-stealing malware called Jester Stealer  on compromised systems.  The mass email campaign carries the subject line "chemical attack" and contains a link to a macro-enabled Microsoft Excel file, opening which leads to computers getting infected with Jester Stealer.  The attack, which requires potential victims to enable macros after opening the document, works by downloading and executing an .EXE file that is retrieved from compromised web resources, CERT-UA detailed.   Jester Stealer, which was  first documented  by Cyble in February 2022, comes with features to steal and transmit login credentials, cookies, and credit card information along with data from passwords managers, chat messengers, email clients, crypto wallets, and gaming apps to the attackers.

The U.S. State Department has  announced  rewards of up to $10 million for any information leading to the identification of key individuals who are part of the infamous Conti cybercrime gang.  Additionally, it's offering another $5 million for intelligence information that could help arrest or convict individuals who are conspiring or attempting to affiliate with the group in a ransomware attack.  The department called the Conti variant the "costliest strain of ransomware ever documented."   Conti , the work of a Russia-based transnational organized crime group dubbed Gold Ulrick, is one most prolific ransomware cartels that has continued to strike entities globally while simultaneously  expanding its empire  by absorbing TrickBot and running side hustles that involve data extortion.  After the syndicate expressed public support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, it  suffered a major breach  of its own after its source code and internal chats were released

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Days after F5 released patches for a critical remote code execution vulnerability affecting its BIG-IP family of products, security researchers are warning that they were able to create an exploit for the shortcoming.  Tracked  CVE-2022-1388  (CVSS score: 9.8), the flaw relates to an iControl REST authentication bypass that, if successfully exploited, could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain initial access and take control of an affected system.  This could range anywhere from deploying cryptocurrency miners to deploying web shells for follow-on attacks, such as information theft and ransomware.   "We have reproduced the fresh CVE-2022-1388 in F5's BIG-IP," cybersecurity company Positive Technologies  said  in a tweet on Friday. "Patch ASAP!"  The critical security vulnerability impacts the following versions of BIG-IP products -   16.1.0 - 16.1.2  15.1.0 - 15.1.5  14.1.0 - 14.1.4  13.1.0 - 13.1.4  12.1.0 - 12.1.6  11.6.1 - 11.6.5   Fix

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday moved to sanction virtual currency mixer Blender.io, marking the first time a mixing service has been subjected to economic blockades.  The move signals continued efforts on the part of the government to prevent North Korea's Lazarus Group from laundering the funds stolen from the  unprecedented hack of Ronin Bridge  in late March.  The newly imposed sanctions, issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), target 45 Bitcoin addresses linked to Blender.io and four new wallets linked to Lazarus Group, an advanced persistent with ties to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).  "Blender was used in processing over $20.5 million of the illicit proceeds," the Treasury  said , adding it was utilized by DPRK to "support its malicious cyber activities and money-laundering of stolen virtual currency."

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new malicious campaign has been spotted taking advantage of Windows event logs to stash chunks of shellcode for the first time in the wild.  "It allows the 'fileless' last stage trojan to be hidden from plain sight in the file system," Kaspersky researcher Denis Legezo  said  in a technical write-up published this week.  The stealthy infection process, not attributed to a known actor, is believed to have commenced in September 2021 when the intended targets were lured into downloading compressed .RAR files containing Cobalt Strike and  Silent Break .   The adversary simulation software modules are then used as a launchpad to inject code into Windows system processes or trusted applications.  Also notable is the use of anti-detection wrappers as part of the toolset, suggesting an attempt on the part of the operators to fly under the radar.   One of the key methods is to keep encrypted shellcode containing the next-stage malware as 8KB pieces in event logs, a never-b

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new Windows malware with worm-like capabilities and is propagated by means of removable USB devices.  Attributing the malware to a cluster named " Raspberry Robin ," Red Canary researchers  noted  that the worm "leverages Windows Installer to reach out to QNAP-associated domains and download a malicious DLL."  The earliest signs of the activity are said to date back to September 2021, with infections observed in organizations with ties to technology and manufacturing sectors.   Attack chains pertaining to Raspberry Robin start with connecting an infected USB drive to a Windows machine. Present within the device is the worm payload, which appears as a .LNK shortcut file to a legitimate folder.   The worm then takes care of spawning a new process using cmd.exe to read and execute a malicious file stored on the external drive.  This is followed by launching explorer.exe and msiexec.exe, the latter of which is used for extern

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A pay-per-install (PPI) malware service known as PrivateLoader has been spotted distributing a "fairly sophisticated" framework called NetDooka, granting attackers complete control over the infected devices.  "The framework is distributed via a pay-per-install (PPI) service and contains multiple parts, including a loader, a dropper, a protection driver, and a full-featured remote access trojan (RAT) that implements its own network communication protocol," Trend Micro  said  in a report published Thursday.  PrivateLoader, as documented  by Intel 471 in February 2022, functions as a downloader responsible for downloading and installing additional malware onto the infected system, including SmokeLoader, RedLine Stealer, Vidar, Raccoon, GCleaner, and  Anubis .   Featuring anti-analysis techniques, PrivateLoader is written in the C++ programming language and is said to be in active development, with the downloader malware family gaining traction among multiple threat ac

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The China-based threat actor known as Mustang Panda  has been observed refining and retooling its tactics and malware to strike entities located in Asia, the European Union, Russia, and the U.S.  "Mustang Panda is a highly motivated APT group relying primarily on the use of topical lures and social engineering to trick victims into infecting themselves," Cisco Talos  said  in a new report detailing the group's evolving modus operandi.   The group is known to have targeted a wide range of organizations since at least 2012, with the actor primarily relying on email-based social engineering to gain initial access to drop PlugX, a backdoor predominantly deployed for long-term access.  Phishing messages attributed to the campaign contain malicious lures masquerading as official European Union reports on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine or Ukrainian government reports, both of which download malware onto compromised machines.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has released monthly security patches for Android with fixes for 37 flaws across different components, one of which is a fix for an actively exploited Linux kernel vulnerability that came to light earlier this year.  Tracked as  CVE-2021-22600  (CVSS score: 7.8), the vulnerability is ranked "High" for severity and could be exploited by a local user to escalate privileges or deny service.  The issue relates to a  double-free vulnerability  residing in the  Packet  network protocol implementation in the Linux kernel that could cause memory corruption, potentially leading to denial-of-service or execution of arbitrary code.   Patches were released by different Linux distributions, including  Debian ,  Red Hat ,  SUSE , and  Ubuntu  in January 2022.  "There are indications that CVE-2021-22600 may be under limited, targeted exploitation," Google  noted  in its Android Security Bulletin for May 2022. Specifics about the nature of the attacks are unknown as yet.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on Thursday released an updated cybersecurity guidance for managing risks in the supply chain, as it increasingly emerges as a lucrative attack vector.  "It encourages organizations to consider the vulnerabilities not only of a finished product they are considering using, but also of its components — which may have been developed elsewhere — and the journey those components took to reach their destination," NIST said in a statement.   The new  directive  outlines  major security controls and practices  that entities should adopt to identify, assess, and respond to risks at different stages of the supply chain, including the possibility of malicious functionality, flaws in third-party software, insertion of counterfeit hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices.   The development follows an Executive Order issued by the U.S. President on " Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity (14028) " las

Google to Add Passwordless Authentication Support to Android and Chrome<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/google-to-add-passwordless.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google today announced  plans  to implement support for passwordless logins in Android and the Chrome web browser to allow users to seamlessly and securely sign in across different devices and websites irrespective of the platform.  "This will simplify sign-ins across devices, websites, and applications no matter the platform — without the need for a single password," Google  said .   Apple and Microsoft are also expected to extend the support to iOS, macOS, and Windows operating systems as well as Safari and Edge browsers.  The common Fast IDentity Online ( FIDO ) sign-in system does away with passwords entirely in favor of displaying a prompt asking a user to unlock the phone when signing into a website or an application.  This is made possible by storing a cryptographically-secured FIDO credential called a passkey on the phone that's used to log in to the online account after unlocking the device.  "Once you've done this, you won't need your phone again a

The developers who create the software, applications and programs that drive digital business have become the lifeblood of many organizations. Most modern businesses would not be able to (profitably) function, without competitive applications and programs, or without 24-hour access to their websites and other infrastructure.  And yet, these very same touchpoints are also often the gateway that hackers and other nefarious users employ in order to steal information, launch attacks and springboard to other criminal activities such as fraud and ransomware.   Successful attacks remain prevalent, even though spending on cybersecurity in most organizations is way up, and even though movements  like DevSecOps  are shifting security towards those developers who are the lifeblood of business today. Developers understand the importance of security, and overwhelmingly want to deploy secure and quality code, but software vulnerabilities continue to be exploited.   Why?  For the 2nd year, Secure Co

"These vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate privileges enabling them to disable security products, overwrite system components, corrupt the operating system, or perform malicious operations unimpeded," SentinelOne researcher Kasif Dekel  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.   Tracked as CVE-2022-26522 and CVE-2022-26523, the flaws reside in a legitimate anti-rootkit kernel driver named aswArPot.sys and are said to have been introduced in Avast version 12.1, which was released in June 2016.  Specifically, the shortcomings are rooted in a socket connection handler in the kernel driver that could lead to privilege escalation by running code in the kernel from a non-administrator user, potentially causing the operating system to crash and display a blue screen of death ( BSoD ) e

Heroku Forces User Password Resets Following GitHub OAuth Token Theft<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/heroku-forces-user-password-resets.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Salesforce-owned subsidiary Heroku on Thursday acknowledged that the theft of GitHub integration OAuth tokens further involved unauthorized access to an internal customer database.  The company, in an  updated notification , revealed that a compromised token was abused to breach the database and "exfiltrate the hashed and salted passwords for customers' user accounts."  As a consequence, Salesforce said it's resetting all Heroku user passwords and ensuring that potentially affected credentials are refreshed. It also emphasized that internal Heroku credentials were rotated and extra detections have been put in place.   The attack campaign, which GitHub  discovered  on April 12, related to an unidentified actor leveraging stolen OAuth user tokens issued to two third-party OAuth integrators, Heroku and Travis-CI, to download data from dozens of organizations, including NPM.  The timeline of events as shared by the cloud platform is as follows -   April 7, 2022  - Threat

An ElasticSearch server instance that was left open on the Internet without a password contained sensitive financial information about loans from Indian and African financial services.  The leak, which was discovered by researchers from information security company UpGuard, amounted to 5.8GB and consisted of a total of 1,686,363 records.  "Those records included personal information like name, loan amount, date of birth, account number, and more," UpGuard  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "A total of 48,043 unique email addresses were in the collection, some of which were for the product administrators, corporate clients, and collection agents assigned to each case."   The exposed instance, used as data storage for a  debt collection platform  called ENCollect, was detected on February 16, 2022.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday announced that it will expand and rebrand its Cyber Unit to fight against cyber-related threats and protect investors in cryptocurrency markets.  To that end, the SEC is renaming the Cyber Unit within the  Division of Enforcement  to Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and plans to infuse 20 additional positions with the goal of investigating wrongdoing in the crypto markets.  The goal, per the agency, is to tackle cryptocurrency fraud and crackdown on  malicious actors  attempting to profit from crypto marketplaces.   The Cyber Unit was  instituted  in September 2017 with a focus on addressing cyber-based threats and protecting retail investors. But given the dramatic evolution of the digital assets markets in recent years, the new unit is expected to focus on securities law violations pertaining to -   Crypto asset offerings  Crypto asset exchanges  Crypto asset lending and staking products  Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A pre-authenticated remote code execution vulnerability has been disclosed in dotCMS, an open-source content management system written in Java and " used by  over 10,000 clients in over 70 countries around the globe, from Fortune 500 brands and mid-sized businesses."  The critical flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-26352 , stems from a directory traversal attack when performing file uploads, enabling an adversary to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system.   "An attacker can upload arbitrary files to the system," Shubham Shah of Assetnote  said  in a report. "By uploading a JSP file to the tomcat's root directory, it is possible to achieve code execution, leading to command execution."  In other words, the arbitrary file upload flaw can be abused to replace already existing files in the system with a web shell, which can then be used to gain persistent remote access.   Although the exploit made it possible to write to arbitrary JavaScript files bei

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have detailed as many as five severe security flaws in the implementation of TLS protocol in several models of Aruba and Avaya network switches that could be abused to gain remote access to enterprise networks and steal valuable information.  The findings follow the March disclosure of  TLStorm , a set of three critical flaws in APC Smart-UPS devices that could permit an attacker to take over control and, worse, physically damage the appliances.  IoT security firm Armis, which uncovered the shortcomings, noted that the design flaws can be traced back to a common source: a misuse of  NanoSSL , a standards-based SSL developer suite from Mocana, a DigiCert subsidiary.   The new set of flaws, dubbed  TLStorm 2.0 , renders Aruba and Avaya network switches vulnerable to remote code execution vulnerabilities, enabling an adversary to commandeer the devices, move laterally across the network, and exfiltrate sensitive data.  Affected devices include Avaya ERS3500 Seri

Experts Analyze Conti and Hive Ransomware Gangs' Chats With Their Victims<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/experts-analyze-conti-and-hive.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An analysis of four months of chat logs spanning more than 40 conversations between the operators of Conti and Hive ransomware and their victims has offered an insight into the groups' inner workings and their negotiation techniques.  In one exchange, the Conti Team is said to have significantly reduced the ransom demand from a staggering $50 million to $1 million, a 98% drop, suggesting a willingness to settle for a far lower amount.  "Both Conti and Hive are quick to lower ransom demands, routinely offering substantial reductions multiple times throughout negotiations," Cisco Talos  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This signals that despite popular belief, victims of a ransomware attack actually have significant negotiating power."  Conti  and  Hive  are among the most prevalent ransomware strains in the threat landscape, cumulatively accounting for  29.1% of attacks  detected during the three-month-period between October and December 2021.

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new variant of the AvosLocker ransomware that disables antivirus solutions to evade detection after breaching target networks by taking advantage of unpatched security flaws.   "This is the first sample we observed from the U.S. with the capability to disable a defense solution using a legitimate Avast Anti-Rootkit Driver file (asWarPot.sys)," Trend Micro researchers, Christoper Ordonez and Alvin Nieto,  said  in a Monday analysis.  "In addition, the ransomware is also capable of scanning multiple endpoints for the Log4j vulnerability (Log4shell) using Nmap  NSE script ."  AvosLocker , one of the newer ransomware families to fill the vacuum left by  REvil , has been linked to a number of attacks that targeted critical infrastructure in the U.S., including financial services and government facilities.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Chinese-aligned cyberespionage group has been observed striking the telecommunication sector in Central Asia with versions of malware such as ShadowPad and PlugX.  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne tied the intrusions to an actor it tracks under the name "Moshen Dragon," with tactical overlaps between the collective and another threat group referred to as Nomad Panda (aka  RedFoxtrot ).  "PlugX and ShadowPad have a well-established history of use among Chinese-speaking threat actors primarily for espionage activity," SentinelOne's Joey Chen  said . "Those tools have flexible, modular functionality and are compiled via shellcode to easily bypass traditional endpoint protection products."   ShadowPad , labeled a "masterpiece of privately sold malware in Chinese espionage," emerged as a successor to PlugX in 2015, even as variants of the latter have continually popped up as part of different campaigns associated with Chinese threat actors.

Unpatched DNS Related Vulnerability Affects a Wide Range of IoT Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/unpatched-dns-related-vulnerability.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed an unpatched security vulnerability that could pose a serious risk to IoT products.  The issue, which was originally reported in September 2021, affects the Domain Name System (DNS) implementation of two popular C libraries called  uClibc  and  uClibc-ng  that are used for developing embedded Linux systems.   uClibc is known to be used by major vendors such as Linksys, Netgear, and Axis, as well as Linux distributions like Embedded Gentoo, potentially exposing millions of IoT devices to security threats.  "The flaw is caused by the predictability of transaction IDs included in the DNS requests generated by the library, which may allow attackers to perform DNS poisoning attacks against the target device," Giannis Tsaraias and Andrea Palanca of Nozomi Networks  said  in a Monday write-up.   DNS poisoning , also referred to as DNS spoofing, is the technique of corrupting a DNS resolver cache — which provides clients with the IP address a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly discovered suspected espionage threat actor has been targeting employees focusing on mergers and acquisitions as well as large corporate transactions to facilitate bulk email collection from victim environments.  Mandiant is tracking the activity cluster under the uncategorized moniker UNC3524, citing a lack of evidence linking it to an existing group. However, some of the intrusions are said to mirror techniques used by different Russia-based hacking crews like  APT28  and  APT29 .    "The high level of operational security, low malware footprint, adept evasive skills, and a large Internet of Things (IoT) device botnet set this group apart and emphasize the 'advanced' in Advanced Persistent Threat," the threat intelligence firm  said  in a Monday report.  The initial access route is unknown but upon gaining a foothold, attack chains involving UNC3524 culminate in the deployment of a novel backdoor called QUIETEXIT for persistent remote access for as long as

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud-based code hosting platform GitHub described the recent  attack campaign  involving the abuse of OAuth access tokens issued to Heroku and Travis-CI as "highly targeted" in nature.  "This pattern of behavior suggests the attacker was only listing organizations in order to identify accounts to selectively target for listing and downloading private repositories," GitHub's Mike Hanley  said  in an updated post.   The  security incident , which it discovered on April 12, related to an unidentified attacker leveraging stolen OAuth user tokens issued to two third-party OAuth integrators, Heroku and Travis-CI, to download data from dozens of organizations, including NPM.  The Microsoft-owned company said last week that it's in the process of sending a final set of notifications to GitHub customers who had either the Heroku or Travis CI OAuth app integrations authorized in their accounts.

A Chinese state-sponsored espionage group known as Override Panda  has resurfaced in recent weeks with a new phishing attack with the goal of stealing sensitive information.  "The Chinese APT used a spear-phishing email to deliver a beacon of a Red Team framework known as 'Viper,'" Cluster25  said  in a report published last week.  "The target of this attack is currently unknown but with high probability, given the previous history of the attack perpetrated by the group, it might be a government institution from a South Asian country."   Override Panda, also called  Naikon , Hellsing, and Bronze Geneva, is known to operate on behalf of Chinese interests since at least 2005 to conduct intelligence-gathering operations targeting  ASEAN countries .  Attack chains unleashed by the threat actor have involved the use of decoy documents attached to spear-phishing emails that are designed to entice the intended victims to open and compromise themselves with malware

According to folklore, witches were able to sail in a sieve, a strainer with holes in the bottom. Unfortunately, witches don't work in cybersecurity – where networks generally have so many vulnerabilities that they resemble sieves.   For most of us, keeping the sieve of our networks afloat requires nightmarishly hard work and frequent compromises on which holes to plug first.  The reason? In 2010, just under 5000 CVEs were recorded in the MITRE vulnerabilities database. By 2021, the yearly total had skyrocketed to  over 20,000 . Today, software and network integrity are synonymous with business continuity. And this makes the issue of which vulnerabilities to address first mission-critical. Yet owing to the countless documented vulnerabilities lurking in a typical enterprise ecosystem – across thousands of laptops, servers, and internet-connected devices – less than  one in ten  actually needs to be patched. The question is: how can we know which patches will ensure that our sieve does

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Russian state-sponsored threat actor has been observed targeting diplomatic and government entities as part of a series of phishing campaigns commencing on January 17, 2022.  Threat intelligence and incident response firm Mandiant attributed the attacks to a hacking group tracked as APT29 (aka Cozy Bear), with some set of the activities associated with the crew assigned the moniker  Nobelium  (aka UNC2452/2652).  "This latest wave of spear phishing showcases APT29's enduring interests in obtaining diplomatic and foreign policy information from governments around the world," Mandiant  said  in a report published last week.  The initial access is said to have been aided through spear-phishing emails masquerading as administrative notices, using legitimate but compromised email addresses from other diplomatic entities.   These emails contain an HTML dropper attachment called ROOTSAW (aka  EnvyScout ) that, when opened, triggers an infection sequence that delivers and exec

Google has officially  released  the first developer preview for the Privacy Sandbox  on Android 13, offering an "early look" at the SDK Runtime and Topics API to boost users' privacy online.  "The Privacy Sandbox on Android Developer Preview program will run over the course of 2022, with a beta release planned by the end of the year," the search giant  said  in an overview.  A "multi-year effort,"  Privacy Sandbox  on Android aims to create technologies that's both privacy-preserving as well as keep online content and services free without having to resort to opaque methods of digital advertising.   The idea is to limit sharing of user data with third-parties and operate without cross-app identifiers, including advertising ID, a unique, user-resettable string of letters and digits that can be used to track users as they move between apps.

"The Package Analysis project seeks to understand the behavior and capabilities of packages available on open source repositories: what files do they access, what addresses do they connect to, and what commands do they run?," the OpenSSF  said .  "The project also tracks changes in how packages behave over time, to identify when previously safe software begins acting suspiciously," the foundation's Caleb Brown and David A. Wheeler added.

At least six different Russia-aligned actors launched no less than 237 cyberattacks against Ukraine from February 23 to April 8, including 38 discrete destructive attacks that irrevocably destroyed files in hundreds of systems across dozens of organizations in the country.  "Collectively, the cyber and kinetic actions work to disrupt or degrade Ukrainian government and military functions and undermine the public's trust in those same institutions," the company's Digital Security Unit (DSU)  said  in a special report.  The major malware families that have been leveraged for destructive activity as part of Russia's relentless digital assaults include:  WhisperGate ,  HermeticWiper  ( FoxBlade  aka KillDisk),  HermeticRansom  (SonicVote),  IssacWiper  (Lasainraw),  CaddyWiper ,  DesertBlade ,  DoubleZero  (FiberLake), and  Industroyer2 .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Thursday disclosed that it addressed a pair of issues with the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server that could result in unauthorized cross-account database access in a region.  "By exploiting an elevated permissions bug in the Flexible Server authentication process for a replication user, a malicious user could leverage an improperly anchored regular expression to bypass authentication to gain access to other customers' databases," Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)  said .   New York City-based cloud security company Wiz, which uncovered the flaws, dubbed the exploit chain " ExtraReplica ." Microsoft said it mitigated the bug within 48 hours of disclosure on January 13, 2022.  Specifically, it relates to a case of privilege escalation in the Azure PostgreSQL engine to gain code execution and a cross-account authentication bypass by means of a forged certificate, allowing an attacker to create a database in the target's Azure r

A cyberespionage threat actor known for targeting a variety of critical infrastructure sectors in Africa, the Middle East, and the U.S. has been observed using an upgraded version of a remote access trojan with information stealing capabilities.  Calling  TA410  an umbrella group comprised of three teams dubbed FlowingFrog, LookingFrog and JollyFrog, Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET  assessed  that "these subgroups operate somewhat independently, but that they may share intelligence requirements, an access team that runs their spear-phishing campaigns, and also the team that deploys network infrastructure."  TA410 — said to share behavioral and tooling overlaps with  APT10  (aka Stone Panda or TA429) — has a history of targeting U.S-based organizations in the utilities sector as well as diplomatic entities in the Middle East and Africa.  Other identified victims of the hacker collective include a manufacturing company in Japan, a mining business in India, and a charity in Isra

You've been asked for a Vulnerability Assessment Report for your organisation and for some of you reading this article, your first thought is likely to be "What is that?"  Worry not. This article will answer that very question as well as why you need a Vulnerability Assessment Report and where you can get one from.   As it's likely the request for such a report came from an important source such as the Board, a partner, a client or an auditor, there isn't a moment to waste. So let's drive straight in.  What is a Vulnerability Assessment Report and why do you need one?  A Vulnerability Assessment Report is simply a document that illustrates how you are managing your organisation's vulnerabilities.

Cybercriminal actors previously observed delivering BazaLoader and IcedID as part of their malware campaigns are said to have transitioned to a new loader called Bumblebee that's under active development.  "Based on the timing of its appearance in the threat landscape and use by multiple cybercriminal groups, it is likely Bumblebee is, if not a direct replacement for BazaLoader, then a new, multifunctional tool used by actors that historically favored other malware," enterprise security firm Proofpoint  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  Campaigns distributing the new highly sophisticated loader are said to have commenced in March 2022, while sharing overlaps with malicious activity  leading to the deployment of Conti and Diavol ransomware, raising the possibility that the loader could act as a precursor for ransomware attacks.

A new campaign leveraging an exploit kit has been observed abusing an Internet Explorer flaw patched by Microsoft last year to deliver the RedLine Stealer trojan.

Most of the infections are located in Brazil and Germany, followed by the U.S., Egypt, Canada, China, and Poland, among others.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloudflare on Wednesday disclosed that it acted to mitigate a 15.3 million request-per-second (RPS) distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. The web infrastructure and website security company called it one of the "largest HTTPS DDoS attacks on record."   "HTTPS DDoS attacks are more expensive in terms of required computational resources because of the higher cost of establishing a secure TLS encrypted connection," Cloudflare's Omer Yoachimik and Julien Desgats  said . "Therefore it costs the attacker more to launch the attack, and for the victim to mitigate it."   The volumetric DDoS attack is said to have lasted less than 15 seconds and targeted an unnamed Cloudflare customer operating a crypto launchpad.   Volumetric DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm a target network/service with significantly high volumes of malicious traffic, which typically originate from a botnet under a threat actor's control.   Cloudflare said the latest attack w

Bad actors continuously evolve their tactics and are becoming more sophisticated. Within the past couple of years, we've seen supply chain attacks that quickly create widespread damage throughout entire industries. But the attackers aren't just focusing their efforts on supply chains. For example, businesses are becoming increasingly more reliant on SaaS apps and the cloud – creating a new avenue for attackers to steal critical data and assets. The looming threat of ransomware attacks, phishing scams, and destructive BEC campaigns has businesses wondering: do I need to increase my security?  As a result, many managed service providers (MSP) are fielding questions about the level of security they can provide for their customers. In this new environment, MSPs are finding they can no longer avoid offering cybersecurity services. Fortunately,  there's an eBook  for MSPs who are expanding into the security space as managed security service providers (MSSP).   It's vital for MSPs to have a

A China-linked government-sponsored threat actor observed striking European diplomatic entities in March may have been targeting Russian government officials with an updated version of a remote access trojan called  PlugX .  Secureworks attributed the attempted intrusions to a threat actor it tracks as Bronze President, and by the wider cybersecurity community under the monikers Mustang Panda, TA416, HoneyMyte, RedDelta, and PKPLUG.  "The war in Ukraine has prompted many countries to deploy their cyber capabilities to gain insight about global events, political machinations, and motivations," the cybersecurity firm  said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This desire for situational awareness often extends to collecting intelligence from allies and 'friends.'"

The transparency measure, which is built along the lines of Apple's " Privacy Nutrition Labels ," was  first announced  by Google nearly a year ago in May 2021.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A "logical flaw" has been disclosed in NPM, the default package manager for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment, that enables malicious actors to pass off rogue libraries as legitimate and trick unsuspecting developers into installing them.  The supply chain threat has been dubbed "Package Planting" by researchers from cloud security firm Aqua. Following responsible disclosure on February 10, the underlying issue was remediated by NPM on April 26.   "Up until recently, NPM allowed adding anyone as a maintainer of the package without notifying these users or getting their consent," Aqua's Yakir Kadkoda  said  in a report published Tuesday.  This effectively meant that an adversary could create malware-laced packages and assign them to trusted, popular maintainers without their knowledge.   The idea here is to add credible owners associated with other popular NPM libraries to the attacker-controlled poisoned package in hopes that doing so would a

Microsoft Discovers New Privilege Escalation Flaws in Linux Operating System<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/microsoft-discovers-new-privilege.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Tuesday disclosed a set of two privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the Linux operating system that could potentially allow threat actors to carry out an array of nefarious activities.  Collectively called " Nimbuspwn ," the flaws "can be chained together to gain root privileges on Linux systems, allowing attackers to deploy payloads, like a root backdoor, and perform other malicious actions via arbitrary root code execution," Jonathan Bar Or of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team  said  in a report.   On top of that, the defects — tracked as  CVE-2022-29799 and CVE-2022-29800  — could also be weaponized as a vector for root access to deploy more sophisticated threats such as ransomware.  The vulnerabilities are rooted in a  systemd  component called  networkd-dispatcher , a  daemon program  for the network manager system service that's designed to dispatch network status changes.   Specifically, they relate to a combination of  directory t

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The threat actor behind the prolific Emotet botnet is testing new attack methods on a small scale before co-opting them into their larger volume malspam campaigns, potentially in response to Microsoft's move to disable Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros by default across its products.  Calling the new activity a "departure" from the group's typical behavior, ProofPoint alternatively  raised the possibility  that the latest set of phishing emails distributing the malware show that the operators are now "engaged in more selective and limited attacks in parallel to the typical massive scale email campaigns."   Emotet, the handiwork of a cybercrime group tracked as  TA542  (aka Mummy Spider or  Gold Crestwood ), staged a  revival of sorts  late last year after a 10-month-long hiatus following a coordinated law enforcement operation to take down its attack infrastructure.   Since then, Emotet  campaigns  have targeted thousands of customers with tens of

The infamous ransomware group known as Conti has  continued  its onslaught against entities despite suffering a massive data leak of its own earlier this year, according to new research.  Conti, attributed to a Russia-based threat actor known as Gold Ulrick , is one of the most prevalent malware strains in the ransomware landscape, accounting for  19% of all attacks  during the three-month-period between October and December 2021.  One of the most prolific ransomware groups of the last year along the likes of LockBit 2.0, PYSA, and Hive, Conti has locked the networks of hospitals, businesses, and government agencies, while receiving a ransom payment in exchange for sharing the decryption key as part of its name-and-shame scheme.  But after the cybercriminal cartel came out in support of Russia over its invasion of Ukraine in February, an anonymous Ukrainian security researcher under the Twitter handle  ContiLeaks  began leaking the source code as well as private conversations between

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A state-backed threat actor with ties to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DRPK) has been attributed to a spear-phishing campaign targeting journalists covering the country with the ultimate goal of deploying a backdoor on infected Windows systems.  The intrusions, said to be the work of Ricochet Chollima, resulted in the deployment of a novel malware strain called GOLDBACKDOOR, an artifact that shares technical overlaps with another malware named BLUELIGHT, which has been previously linked to the group.  "Journalists are high-value targets for hostile governments," cybersecurity firm Stairwell  said  in a report published last week. "Compromising a journalist can provide access to highly-sensitive information and enable additional attacks against their sources."   Ricochet Chollima, also known as  APT37 , InkySquid, and ScarCruft, is a North Korean-nexus targeted intrusion adversary that has been involved in espionage attacks since at least 2016. The

An Iranian-linked threat actor known as  Rocket Kitten  has been observed actively exploiting a recently patched VMware vulnerability to gain initial access and deploy the Core Impact penetration testing tool on vulnerable systems.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-22954  (CVSS score: 9.8), the critical issue concerns a case of remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager.   While the issue was patched by the virtualization services provider on April 6, 2022, the company  cautioned users  of confirmed exploitation of the flaw occurring in the wild a week later.  "A malicious actor exploiting this RCE vulnerability potentially gains an unlimited attack surface," researchers from Morphisec Labs  said  in a new report. "This means highest privileged access into any components of the virtualized host and guest environment."   Attack chains exploiting the flaw involve the distribution of a PowerShell-based stager, which is the

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers have disclosed a security vulnerability in the VirusTotal platform that could have been potentially weaponized to achieve remote code execution (RCE).  The flaw, now patched, made it possible to "execute commands remotely within VirusTotal platform and gain access to its various scans capabilities," Cysource researchers Shai Alfasi and Marlon Fabiano da Silva said in a report  exclusively shared with The Hacker News.  VirusTotal , part of Google's Chronicle security subsidiary, is a malware-scanning service that analyzes suspicious files and URLs and checks for viruses using more than 70 third-party antivirus products.   The attack method involved the upload of a DjVu file through the platform's  web user interface , using it to trigger an exploit for a high-severity remote code execution flaw in  ExifTool , an open-source utility used to read and edit EXIF metadata information in image and PDF files.   Tracked as  CVE-2021-22204  (CVSS score: 7.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new variant of an IoT botnet called BotenaGo has emerged in the wild, specifically singling out Lilin security camera DVR devices to infect them with Mirai malware.  Dubbed " Lilin Scanner " by Nozomi Networks, the  latest version  is designed to exploit a two-year-old critical  command injection vulnerability  in the DVR firmware that was patched by the Taiwanese company in February 2020.   BotenaGo , first documented in November 2021 by AT&T Alien Labs, is written in Golang and features over 30 exploits for known vulnerabilities in web servers, routers and other kinds of IoT devices.  The botnet's source code has since been uploaded to GitHub, making it ripe for abuse by other criminal actors. "With only 2,891 lines of code, BotenaGo has the potential to be the starting point for many new variants and new malware families using its source code," the researchers  said  this year.  The new BotenaGo malware is the  latest  to exploit vulnerabilities in Lil

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is sounding the alarm on the BlackCat ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), which it said victimized at least 60 entities worldwide between as of March 2022 since its emergence last November.  Also called ALPHV and  Noberus , the ransomware is notable for being the first-ever malware written in the Rust programming language that's known to be memory safe and offer improved performance.   "Many of the developers and money launderers for BlackCat/ALPHV are linked to  DarkSide / BlackMatter , indicating they have extensive networks and experience with ransomware operations," the FBI said in an  advisory  published last week.  The disclosure comes weeks after twin reports from  Cisco Talos  and  Kasperksy  uncovered links between BlackCat and BlackMatter ransomware families, including the use of a modified version of a data exfiltration tool dubbed Fendr that's been previously only observed in BlackMatter-related activity.

T-Mobile, in a statement, said that the incident occurred "several weeks ago, with the "bad actor" using stolen credentials to access internal systems. "The systems accessed contained no customer or government information or other similarly sensitive information, and we have no evidence that the intruder was able to obtain anything of value," it added.   The VPN credentials for initial access are said to have been obtained from illicit websites like Russian Market with the goal of gaining control of T-Mobile employee accounts, ultimately allowing

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrating a newly disclosed digital signature bypass vulnerability in Java has been shared online.   The  high-severity flaw  in question,  CVE-2022-21449  (CVSS score: 7.5), impacts the following version of Java SE and Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition -   Oracle Java SE: 7u331, 8u321, 11.0.14, 17.0.2, 18  Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.5, 21.3.1, 22.0.0.2   The issue resides in Java's implementation of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ( ECDSA ), a  cryptographic mechanism  to  digitally sign  messages and data for verifying the authenticity and the integrity of the contents.   In a nutshell, the cryptographic blunder — dubbed Psychic Signatures in Java — makes it possible to present a totally blank signature, which would still be perceived as valid by the vulnerable implementation.   Successful exploitation of the flaw could permit an attacker to forge signatures and bypass authentication measures put in place.  The PoC, p

LemonDuck, a cross-platform cryptocurrency mining botnet, is targeting Docker to mine cryptocurrency on Linux systems as part of an active malware campaign.  "It runs an anonymous mining operation by the use of proxy pools, which hide the wallet addresses," CrowdStrike  said  in a new report. "It evades detection by targeting Alibaba Cloud's monitoring service and disabling it."  Known to strike both Windows and Linux environments, LemonDuck is primarily engineered for abusing the system resources to mine Monero. But it's also capable of credential theft, lateral movement, and facilitating the deployment of additional payloads for follow-on activities.  "It uses a wide range of spreading mechanisms — phishing emails, exploits, USB devices, brute force, among others — and it has shown that it can quickly take advantage of news, events, or the release of new exploits to run effective campaigns," Microsoft  detailed  in a technical write-up of the ma

Network-attached storage (NAS) appliance maker QNAP on Thursday said it's investigating its lineup for potential impact arising from two security vulnerabilities that were addressed in the Apache HTTP server last month.  The critical flaws, tracked as  CVE-2022-22721 and CVE-2022-23943 , are rated 9.8 for severity on the CVSS scoring system and impact Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.52 and earlier -   CVE-2022-22721  - Possible buffer overflow with very large or unlimited LimitXMLRequestBody  CVE-2022-23943  - Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in mod_sed of Apache HTTP Server   Both the vulnerabilities, alongside CVE-2022-22719 and CVE-2022-22720, were remediated by the project maintainers as part of  version 2.4.53 , which was shipped on March 14, 2022.   "While CVE-2022-22719 and CVE-2022-22720 do not affect QNAP products, CVE-2022-22721 affects 32-bit QNAP NAS models, and CVE-2022-23943 affects users who have enabled mod_sed in Apache HTTP Server on their QNAP device,"

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Networking equipment maker Cisco has released security updates to address three high-severity vulnerabilities in its products that could be exploited to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition and take control of affected systems.  The first of the three flaws,  CVE-2022-20783  (CVSS score: 7.5), affects Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software and Cisco RoomOS Software, and stems from a lack of proper input validation, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send specially crafted traffic to the devices.   "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to either reboot normally or reboot into maintenance mode, which could result in a DoS condition on the device," the company  noted  in an advisory.  Credited with discovering and reporting the flaw is the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The issue has been addressed in Cisco TelePresence CE Software versions 9.15.10.8 and 10.11.2.2.

A new set of phishing attacks delivering the more_eggs  malware has been observed striking corporate hiring managers with bogus resumes as an infection vector, a year after potential candidates looking for work on LinkedIn were lured with weaponized job offers .  "This year the more_eggs operation has flipped the social engineering script, targeting hiring managers with fake resumes instead of targeting jobseekers with fake job offers," eSentire's research and reporting lead, Keegan Keplinger, said in a statement .   The Canadian cybersecurity company said it identified and disrupted four separate security incidents, three of which occurred at the end of March. Targeted entities include a U.S.-based aerospace company, an accounting business located in the U.K., a law firm, and a staffing agency, both based out of Canada.  The malware, suspected to be the handiwork of a threat actor called Golden Chickens (aka Venom Spider ), is a stealthy, modular backdoor suite capable

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The "hotpatch" released by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in response to the  Log4Shell  vulnerabilities could be leveraged for container escape and privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to seize control of the underlying host.  "Aside from containers, unprivileged processes can also exploit the patch to escalate privileges and gain root code execution," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researcher Yuval Avrahami  said  in a report published this week.   The issues —  CVE-2021-3100 ,  CVE-2021-3101 ,  CVE-2022-0070 , and  CVE-2022-0071  (CVSS scores: 8.8) — affect the  hotfix solutions  shipped by AWS, and stem from the fact that they are designed to search for Java processes and patch them against the Log4j flaw on the fly but without ensuring that the new Java processes are run within the restrictions imposed on the container.   "Any process running a binary named 'java' – inside or outside of a container – is considered a candidate for the hot patch,"

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unpatched high-severity security flaw has been disclosed in the open-source RainLoop web-based email client that could be weaponized to siphon emails from victims' inboxes.  "The code vulnerability [...] can be easily exploited by an attacker by sending a malicious email to a victim that uses RainLoop as a mail client," SonarSource security researcher Simon Scannell  said  in a report published this week.  "When the email is viewed by the victim, the attacker gains full control over the session of the victim and can steal any of their emails, including those that contain highly sensitive information such as passwords, documents, and password reset links."   Tracked as CVE-2022-29360, the flaw relates to a stored cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability impacting the latest version of RainLoop ( v1.16.0 ) that was released on May 7, 2021.  Stored XSS flaws, also called persistent XSS, occur when a malicious script is injected directly into a target web applic

Three security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the audio decoders of Qualcomm and MediaTek chips that, if left unresolved, could allow an adversary to remotely gain access to media and audio conversations from affected mobile devices.  According to Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point , the issues could be used as a launchpad to carry out remote code execution (RCE) attacks simply by sending a specially crafted audio file.  "The impact of an RCE vulnerability can range from malware execution to an attacker gaining control over a user's multimedia data, including streaming from a compromised machine's camera," the researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "In addition, an unprivileged Android app could use these vulnerabilities to escalate its privileges and gain access to media data and user conversations."   The vulnerabilities are rooted in an audio coding format originally developed and open-sourced by Apple in 2011. Called t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recent Hive ransomware attack carried out by an affiliate involved the exploitation of "ProxyShell" vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Exchange Server that were disclosed last year to encrypt an unnamed customer's network.  "The actor managed to achieve its malicious goals and encrypt the environment in less than 72 hours from the initial compromise," Varonis security researcher, Nadav Ovadia,  said  in a post-mortem analysis of the incident.   Hive, which was  first observed  in June 2021, follows the lucrative ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) scheme adopted by other cybercriminal groups in recent years, enabling affiliates to deploy the file-encrypting malware after gaining a foothold into their victims' networks.   ProxyShell  — tracked as CVE-2021-31207, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-34473 — involves a combination of security feature bypass, privilege escalation, and remote code execution in the Microsoft Exchange Server, effectively granting the attacker

"Russia's invasion of Ukraine could expose organizations both within and beyond the region to increased malicious cyber activity. This activity may occur as a response to the unprecedented economic costs imposed on Russia as well as material support provided by the United States and U.S. allies and partners."

Google Project Zero called 2021 a "record year for in-the-wild 0-days," as  58 security vulnerabilities  were detected and disclosed during the course of the year.  The development marks more than a two-fold jump from the previous maximum when 28 0-day exploits were tracked in 2015. In contrast, only 25 0-day exploits were detected in 2020.  "The large uptick in in-the-wild 0-days in 2021 is due to increased detection and disclosure of these 0-days, rather than simply increased usage of 0-day exploits," Google Project Zero security researcher  Maddie Stone   said .   "Attackers are having success using the same bug patterns and exploitation techniques and going after the same attack surfaces," Stone added.  The tech giant's in-house security team characterized the exploits as similar to previous and publicly known vulnerabilities, with only two of them markedly different for the technical sophistication and use of logic bugs to escape the sandbox.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a now-patched security vulnerability in the Snort intrusion detection and prevention system that could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition and render it powerless against malicious traffic.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-20685 , the vulnerability is rated 7.5 for severity and resides in the Modbus preprocessor of the Snort detection engine. It affects all open-source Snort project releases earlier than 2.9.19 as well as version 3.1.11.0.  Maintained by Cisco,  Snort  is an open-source intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS) that offers real-time network traffic analysis to spot potential signs of malicious activity based on predefined rules.   "The vulnerability, CVE-2022-20685, is an integer-overflow issue that can cause the Snort Modbus OT preprocessor to enter an infinite  while loop ," Uri Katz, a security researcher with Claroty,  said  in a report published last week.

Are you a CISO, CIO, or IT Director?  In your role, you're responsible for breach protection – which means you oversee and govern the process of designing, building, maintaining, and continuously enhancing your organization's security program.   But getting buy-in from leadership can be difficult when they are a non-technical audience.  On top of managing your organization's breach protection activity 24/7, you have to find time to figure out how to effectively articulate the risks, potential impacts, and appropriate steps necessary in a way that will convince leadership to invest in the resources required to keep your organization safe.  Compounding this is the fact that, while you are focused on things like malware, exploits, and network traffic – your leadership is primarily concerned with operational loss and calculated risk.   How do you bridge the gap and help leadership understand your priorities and your team's business impact?  You must identify the security i

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Identity and access management provider Okta on Tuesday said it concluded its probe into the  breach  of a third-party vendor in late January 2022 by the LAPSUS$ extortionist gang.  Stating that the "impact of the incident was significantly less than the maximum potential impact" the company had previously shared last month, Okta  said  the intrusion impacted only two customer tenants, down from 366 as was initially assumed.   The  security event  took place on January 21 when the LAPSUS$ hacking group gained unauthorized remote access to a workstation belonging to a Sitel support engineer. But it only became public knowledge nearly two months later when the adversary  posted  screenshots of Okta's internal systems on their Telegram channel.  In addition to accessing two active customer tenants within the SuperUser application — which is used to perform basic management functions — the hacker group is said to have viewed limited additional information in other applicatio

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security flaw in the Windows Print Spooler component that was patched by Microsoft in February is being actively exploited in the wild, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has warned .  To that end, the agency has added the shortcoming to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog , requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to address the issues by May 10, 2022.   Tracked as CVE-2022-22718  (CVSS score: 7.8), the security vulnerability is one among the four privilege escalation flaws in the Print Spooler that Microsoft resolved as part of its Patch Tuesday updates  on February 8, 2022.  It's worth noting that the Redmond-based tech giant has remediated a number  of Print Spooler flaws since the critical PrintNightmare  remote code execution vulnerability came to light last year, including 15 elevation of privilege vulnerabilities  in April 2022.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Three high-impact Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) security vulnerabilities have been discovered impacting various Lenovo consumer laptop models, enabling malicious actors to deploy and execute firmware implants on the affected devices.  Tracked as CVE-2021-3970, CVE-2021-3971, and CVE-2021-3972, the latter two "affect firmware drivers originally meant to be used only during the manufacturing process of Lenovo consumer notebooks," ESET researcher Martin Smolár  said  in a report published today.   "Unfortunately, they were mistakenly included also in the production BIOS images without being properly deactivated," Smolár added.  Successful exploitation of the flaws could permit an attacker to disable SPI flash protections or Secure Boot, effectively granting the adversary the ability to install persistent malware that can survive system reboots.   CVE-2021-3970, on the other hand, relates to a case of memory corruption in the System Management Mode ( SMM

Experts Uncover Spyware Attacks Against Catalan Politicians and Activists<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/experts-uncover-spyware-attacks-against.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously unknown zero-click exploit in Apple's iMessage was used to install mercenary spyware from  NSO Group  and  Candiru  against at least 65 individuals as part of a "multi-year clandestine operation."  "Victims included Members of the European Parliament, Catalan Presidents, legislators, jurists, and members of civil society organizations," the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab  said  in a new report. "Family members were also infected in some cases."  Of the 65 individuals, 63 were targeted with Pegasus and four others were infected with Candiru, with iPhones belonging to at least two compromised with both. The incidents are said to have mostly occurred between 2017 and 2020.   The attacks involved the weaponization of an iOS exploit dubbed HOMAGE that made it possible to penetrate the devices running versions prior to iOS 13.2, which was released on October 28, 2019. It's worth noting that the latest version of iOS is iOS 15.4.1.

The Microsoft-owned platform also said that it will alert customers promptly should the ongoing investigation identify additional victims.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An 18-month-long analysis of the PYSA ransomware operation has revealed that the cybercrime cartel followed a five-stage software development cycle from August 2020, with the malware authors prioritizing features to improve the efficiency of its workflows.  This included a user-friendly tool like a full-text search engine to facilitate the extraction of metadata and enable the threat actors to find and access victim information quickly.  "The group is known to carefully research high-value targets before launching its attacks, compromising enterprise systems and forcing organizations to pay large ransoms to restore their data," Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT  said  in an exhaustive report published last week.  PYSA, short for "Protect Your System, Amigo" and a successor of the Mespinoza ransomware, was first observed in December 2019 and has emerged as the third most prevalent ransomware strain detected during the fourth quarter of 2021.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new version of the SolarMarker malware that packs in new improvements with the goal of updating its defense evasion abilities and staying under the radar.  "The recent version demonstrated an evolution from Windows Portable Executables (EXE files) to working with Windows installer package files (MSI files)," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers  said  in a report published this month. "This campaign is still in development and going back to using executables files (EXE) as it did in its earlier versions."  SolarMarker, also called Jupyter, leverages manipulated search engine optimization (SEO) tactics as its primary infection vector. It's known for its information stealing and backdoor features, enabling the attackers to steal data stored in web browsers and execute arbitrary commands retrieved from a remote server.   In February 2022, the operators of SolarMarker were  observed  using stealthy Windows Registry trick

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has warned of a new wave of social engineering campaigns delivering IcedID malware and leveraging Zimbra exploits with the goal of stealing sensitive information.  Attributing the IcedID phishing attacks to a threat cluster named UAC-0041, the agency  said  the infection sequence begins with an email containing a Microsoft Excel document (Мобілізаційний реєстр.xls or Mobilization Register.xls) that, when opened, prompts the users to enable macros, leading to the deployment of IcedID.   The  information-stealing malware , also known as BokBot, has followed a similar trajectory to that of TrickBot, Emotet, and ZLoader, evolving from its earlier roots as a banking trojan to a full-fledged crimeware service that facilities the retrieval of next-stage implants such as ransomware.   The  second set of targeted intrusions  relate to a new threat group dubbed UAC-0097, with the email including a number of image attachments with a  Cont

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Elementor, a WordPress website builder plugin with over five million active installations, has been found to be vulnerable to an authenticated remote code execution flaw that could be abused to take over affected websites.  Plugin Vulnerabilities, which  disclosed  the flaw last week, said the bug was introduced in version 3.6.0 that was released on March 22, 2022. Roughly  37% of users  of the plugin are on version 3.6.x.   "That means that malicious code provided by the attacker can be run by the website," the researchers said. "In this instance, it is possible that the vulnerability might be exploitable by someone not logged in to WordPress, but it can easily be exploited by anyone logged in to WordPress who has access to the WordPress admin dashboard."  In a nutshell, the issue relates to a case of arbitrary file upload to affected websites, potentially leading to code execution.   The bug has been addressed in the latest version of Elementor, with Patchstack
