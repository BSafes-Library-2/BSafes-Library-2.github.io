<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Thursday disclosed that it took down the infrastructure associated with a Russian botnet known as RSOCKS in collaboration with law enforcement partners in Germany, the Netherlands, and the U.K.  The botnet, operated by a sophisticated cybercrime organization, is believed to have ensnared millions of internet-connected devices, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Android phones, and computers for use as a proxy service.  Botnets, a constantly evolving threat, are networks of hijacked computer devices that are under the control of a single attacking party and are used to facilitate a variety of large-scale cyber intrusions such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, email spam, and cryptojacking.   "The RSOCKS botnet offered its clients access to IP addresses assigned to devices that had been hacked," the DoJ&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a press release. "The owners of these devices did not give the RSOCKS operator(s) authority to ac

Panchan: A New Golang-based Peer-To-Peer Botnet Targeting Linux Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/panchan-new-golang-based-peer-to-peer.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new Golang-based peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet has been spotted actively targeting Linux servers in the education sector since its emergence in March 2022.  Dubbed&nbsp; Panchan &nbsp;by Akamai Security Research, the malware "utilizes its built-in concurrency features to maximize spreadability and execute malware modules" and "harvests SSH keys to perform lateral movement."   The feature-packed botnet, which relies on a basic list of default SSH passwords to carry out a&nbsp; dictionary attack &nbsp;and expand its reach, primarily functions as a cryptojacker designed to hijack a computer's resources to mine cryptocurrencies.  The cybersecurity and cloud service company noted it first spotted Panchan's activity on March 19, 2022, and attributed the malware to a likely Japanese threat actor based on the language used in the administrative panel baked into the binary to edit the mining configuration.  Panchan is known to deploy and execute two miners, XMRig and nbhash, on the host

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An enhanced version of the XLoader malware has been spotted adopting a probability-based approach to camouflage its command-and-control (C&amp;C) infrastructure, according to the latest research.  "Now it is significantly harder to separate the wheat from the chaff and discover the real C&amp;C servers among thousands of legitimate domains used by Xloader as a smokescreen," Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point&nbsp; said .  First spotted in the wild in October 2020, XLoader is a successor to Formbook and a&nbsp; cross-platform information stealer &nbsp;that's capable of plundering credentials from web browsers, capturing keystrokes and screenshots, and executing arbitrary commands and payloads.   More recently, the&nbsp; ongoing geopolitical conflict &nbsp;between Russia and Ukraine has proved to be a lucrative fodder for&nbsp; distributing XLoader &nbsp;by means of&nbsp; phishing emails &nbsp;aimed at high-ranking government officials in Ukraine.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A nascent Linux-based botnet named Enemybot  has expanded its capabilities to include recently disclosed security vulnerabilities in its arsenal to target web servers, Android devices, and content management systems (CMS).  "The malware is rapidly adopting one-day vulnerabilities as part of its exploitation capabilities," AT&amp;T Alien Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published last week. "Services such as VMware Workspace ONE, Adobe ColdFusion, WordPress, PHP Scriptcase and more are being targeted as well as IoT and Android devices."  First disclosed by&nbsp; Securonix &nbsp;in March and later by&nbsp; Fortinet , Enemybot has been linked to a threat actor tracked as Keksec (aka Kek Security, Necro, and FreakOut), with early attacks targeting routers from Seowon Intech, D-Link, and iRZ.   Enemybot, which is capable of carrying out&nbsp; DDoS attacks , draws its origins from several other botnets like Mirai, Qbot, Zbot, Gafgyt, and LolFMe. An analysis of the latest variant reveals

New Sysrv Botnet Variant Hijacking Windows and Linux with Crypto Miners<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/new-sysrv-botnet-variant-hijacking.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft is warning of a new variant of the srv botnet  that's exploiting multiple security flaws in web applications and databases to install coin miners on both Windows and Linux systems.  The tech giant, which has called the new version Sysrv-K , is said to weaponize an&nbsp; array of exploits &nbsp;to gain control of web servers. The cryptojacking botnet first emerged in December 2020.  "Sysrv-K scans the internet to find web servers with various vulnerabilities to install itself," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets. "The vulnerabilities range from path traversal and remote file disclosure to arbitrary file download and remote code execution vulnerabilities."   This also includes&nbsp; CVE-2022-22947 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 10.0), a code injection vulnerability in Spring Cloud Gateway that could be exploited to allow arbitrary remote execution on a remote host via a maliciously crafted request.  It's worth noting that the abuse of CVE-2022-22947 has prompted the U.S. Cyb

The threat actor behind the prolific Emotet botnet is testing new attack methods on a small scale before co-opting them into their larger volume malspam campaigns, potentially in response to Microsoft's move to disable Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros by default across its products.  Calling the new activity a "departure" from the group's typical behavior, ProofPoint alternatively&nbsp; raised the possibility &nbsp;that the latest set of phishing emails distributing the malware show that the operators are now "engaged in more selective and limited attacks in parallel to the typical massive scale email campaigns."   Emotet, the handiwork of a cybercrime group tracked as&nbsp; TA542 &nbsp;(aka Mummy Spider or&nbsp; Gold Crestwood ), staged a&nbsp; revival of sorts &nbsp;late last year after a 10-month-long hiatus following a coordinated law enforcement operation to take down its attack infrastructure.

The botnet has been attributed to an actor named Keksec (aka&nbsp; Kek Security , Necro, and&nbsp; FreakOut ), which has been linked to multiple botnets such as&nbsp; Simps ,&nbsp; Ryuk &nbsp;(not to be confused with the ransomware of the same name), and&nbsp; Samael , and has a history of targeting cloud infrastructure to carry out crypto mining and DDoS operations.   Primarily targeting routers from Seowon Intech, D-Link, and iRZ to propagate its infections and grow in volume, an analysis of the malware specimen  has highlighted Enemybot's obfuscation attemp

Microsoft Disrupts ZLoader Cybercrime Botnet in Global Operation<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/microsoft-disrupts-zloader-cybercrime.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft and a consortium of cybersecurity companies took legal and technical steps to disrupt the ZLoader botnet , seizing control of 65 domains that were used to control and communicate with the infected hosts.  "ZLoader is made up of computing devices in businesses, hospitals, schools, and homes around the world and is run by a global internet-based organized crime gang operating malware as a service that is designed to steal and extort money," Amy Hogan-Burney, general manager of Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU),&nbsp; said .  The operation, Microsoft said, was undertaken in collaboration with ESET, Lumen's Black Lotus Labs, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, Avast, Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC), and Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (H-ISAC).  As a result of the disruption, the domains are now redirected to a sinkhole, effectively preventing the botnet's criminal operators from contacting the compromised devices.

The recently disclosed critical Spring4Shell  vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors to execute the Mirai  botnet malware , particularly in the Singapore region since the start of April 2022.  "The exploitation allows threat actors to download the Mirai sample to the '/tmp' folder and execute them after permission change using 'chmod ,'" Trend Micro researchers Deep Patel, Nitesh Surana, Ashish Verma said  in a report published Friday.  Tracked as CVE-2022-22965  (CVSS score: 9.8), the vulnerability could allow malicious actors to achieve remote code execution in Spring Core applications under non-default circumstances, granting the attackers full control over the compromised devices.   The development comes as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) earlier this week added  the Spring4Shell vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog based on "evidence of active exploitation."

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced that it neutralized Cyclops Blink , a modular botnet controlled by a threat actor known as Sandworm, which has been attributed to the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU).  "The operation copied and removed malware from vulnerable internet-connected firewall devices that Sandworm used for command-and-control (C2) of the underlying botnet," the DoJ&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement Wednesday.  In addition to disrupting its C2 infrastructure, the operation also closed the external management ports that the threat actor used to establish connections with the firewall appliances, effectively severing contact and preventing the hacking group from using the infected devices to commandeer the botnet.   The March 22 court-authorized disruption of Cyclops Blink comes a little over a month after intelligence agencies in the U.K. and the U.S.&nbsp; described &nbsp;the botnet as a replacement fram

Muhstik, a botnet infamous for propagating via web application exploits, has been observed targeting Redis servers using a recently disclosed vulnerability in the database system.  The vulnerability relates to&nbsp; CVE-2022-0543 , a&nbsp; Lua sandbox escape flaw &nbsp;in the open-source, in-memory, key-value data store that could be abused to achieve remote code execution on the underlying machine. The vulnerability is rated 10 out of 10 for severity.  "Due to a packaging issue, a remote attacker with the ability to execute arbitrary Lua scripts could possibly escape the Lua sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the host," Ubuntu noted in an advisory released last month.  According to&nbsp; telemetry data &nbsp;gathered by Juniper Threat Labs, the attacks leveraging the new flaw are said to have commenced on March 11, 2022, leading to the retrieval of a malicious shell script ("russia.sh") from a remote server, which is then utilized to fetch and execute the botnet binaries from another s

A previously undocumented backdoor has been observed targeting Linux systems with the goal of corralling the machines into a botnet and acting as a conduit for downloading and installing rootkits.  Qihoo 360's Netlab security team called it&nbsp; B1txor20 &nbsp;"based on its propagation using the file name 'b1t,' the XOR encryption algorithm, and the RC4 algorithm key length of 20 bytes."   First observed propagating through the&nbsp; Log4j vulnerability &nbsp;on February 9, 2022, the malware leverages a technique called DNS tunneling to build communication channels with command-and-control (C2) servers by encoding data in DNS queries and responses.   B1txor20, while also buggy in some ways, currently supports the ability to obtain a shell, execute arbitrary commands, install a rootkit, open a&nbsp; SOCKS5 proxy , and functions to upload sensitive information back to the C2 server.  Once a machine is successfully compromised, the malware utilizes the DNS tunnel to retrieve and execute co

Emotet Botnet's Latest Resurgence Spreads to Over 100,000 Computers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/emotet-botnets-latest-resurgence.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The insidious Emotet botnet, which staged a return in November 2021 after a 10-month-long hiatus, is once again exhibiting signs of steady growth, amassing a swarm of over 100,000 infected hosts for perpetrating its malicious activities.  "While Emotet has not yet attained the same scale it once had, the botnet is showing a strong resurgence with a total of approximately 130,000 unique bots spread across 179 countries since November 2021," researchers from Lumen's Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report.  Emotet, prior to its&nbsp; takedown &nbsp;in late January 2021 as part of a coordinated law enforcement operation dubbed "Ladybird," had infected no fewer than 1.6 million devices globally, acting as a conduit for cybercriminals to install other types of malware, such as banking trojans or ransomware, onto compromised systems.   The malware&nbsp; officially resurfaced &nbsp;in November 2021&nbsp; using TrickBot &nbsp;as a delivery vehicle, with the latter&nbsp; shuttering its attack infrastructure

The modular Windows crimeware platform known as TrickBot formally shuttered its infrastructure on Thursday after reports emerged of its&nbsp; imminent retirement &nbsp;amid a lull in its activity for almost two months, marking an end to one of the most persistent malware campaigns in recent years.  "TrickBot is gone... It is official now as of Thursday, February 24, 2022. See you soon... or not," AdvIntel's CEO Vitali Kremez&nbsp; tweeted .&nbsp;"TrickBot is gone as it has become inefficient for targeted intrusions."  Attributed to a Russia-based criminal enterprise called&nbsp; Wizard Spider , TrickBot started out as a financial trojan in late 2016 and is a derivative of another banking malware called&nbsp; Dyre &nbsp;that was dismantled in November 2015. Over the years, it morphed into a veritable Swiss Army knife of malicious capabilities, enabling threat actors to steal information via&nbsp; web injects &nbsp;and drop additional payloads.   TrickBot's activities took a noticeable hit in October 20

Intelligence agencies in the U.K. and the U.S. disclosed details of a new botnet malware called&nbsp; Cyclops Blink &nbsp;that's been attributed to the Russian-backed Sandworm hacking group and deployed in attacks dating back to 2019.  "Cyclops Blink appears to be a replacement framework for the VPNFilter malware exposed in 2018, which exploited network devices, primarily small office/home office (SOHO) routers, and network-attached storage (NAS) devices," the agencies&nbsp; said . "In common with VPNFilter, Cyclops Blink deployment also appears indiscriminate and widespread."  The&nbsp; joint government advisory &nbsp;comes from the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the U.S.   Sandworm , aka Voodoo Bear, is the name assigned to a&nbsp; highly advanced adversary &nbsp;operating out of Russia that's known to be active since at least 2008.

Cybersecurity researchers have unpacked a new Golang-based botnet called&nbsp; Kraken &nbsp;that's under active development and features an array of backdoor capabilities to siphon sensitive information from compromised Windows hosts.  "Kraken already features the ability to download and execute secondary payloads, run shell commands, and take screenshots of the victim's system," threat intelligence firm ZeroFox&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Wednesday.   Discovered first in October 2021, early variants of Kraken have been found to be based on source code uploaded to GitHub, although it's unclear if the repository in question belongs to the malware's operators or if they simply chose to start their development using the code as a foundation.   The botnet – not to be confused with a&nbsp; 2008 botnet &nbsp;of the same name – is perpetuated using&nbsp; SmokeLoader , which chiefly acts as a loader for next-stage malware, allowing it to quickly scale in size and expand its network.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers from the Bitdefender Mobile Threats team said they have intercepted more than 100,000 malicious SMS messages attempting to distribute&nbsp; Flubot &nbsp;malware since the beginning of December.  "Findings indicate attackers are modifying their subject lines and using older yet proven scams to entice users to click," the Romanian cybersecurity firm&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;in a report published Wednesday. "Additionally, attackers are rapidly changing the countries they are targeting in this campaign."  The new wave of attacks is said to have been most active in Australia, Germany, Poland, Spain, Austria, and Italy, among others, with attacks spreading to newer countries like Romania, the Netherlands, and Thailand starting mid-January.  FluBot (aka Cabassous) campaigns use smishing as the primary delivery method to target potential victims, wherein users receive an SMS message with the question "Is this you in this video?" and are tricked into clicking a link that inst

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Social engineering campaigns involving the deployment of the Emotet malware botnet have been observed using "unconventional" IP address formats for the first time in a bid to sidestep detection by security solutions.  This involves the use of hexadecimal and octal representations of the IP address that, when processed by the underlying operating systems, get automatically converted "to the dotted decimal quad representation to initiate the request from the remote servers," Trend Micro's Threat Analyst, Ian Kenefick,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report Friday.   The infection chains, as with previous Emotet-related attacks, aim to trick users into enabling document macros and automate malware execution. The document uses Excel 4.0 Macros, a feature that has been&nbsp; repeatedly &nbsp; abused &nbsp;by malicious actors to deliver malware.  Once enabled, the macro invokes a URL that's obfuscated with carets, with the host incorporating a hexadecimal representation of the IP address — "h

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research into the infrastructure behind an emerging DDoS botnet named Abcbot has uncovered links with a cryptocurrency-mining botnet attack that came to light in December 2020.  Attacks involving Abcbot, first&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by Qihoo 360's Netlab security team in November 2021, are&nbsp; triggered &nbsp;via a malicious shell script that targets insecure cloud instances operated by cloud service providers such as Huawei, Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba Cloud to download malware that co-opts the machine to a botnet, but not before terminating processes from competing threat actors and establishing persistence.  The shell script in question is itself an iteration of an earlier version originally&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;by Trend Micro in October 2021 hitting vulnerable ECS instances inside Huawei Cloud.   But in an interesting twist, continued analysis of the botnet by mapping all known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), including IP addresses, URLs, and samples, has revealed Abcbot's code and feature-leve

Cryptocurrency users in Ethiopia, Nigeria, India, Guatemala, and the Philippines are being targeted by a new variant of the Phorpiex botnet called&nbsp; Twizt &nbsp;that has resulted in the theft of virtual coins amounting to $500,000 over the last one year.  Israeli security firm Check Point Research, which detailed the attacks, said the latest evolutionary version "enables the botnet to operate successfully without active [command-and-control] servers," adding it supports no less than 35 wallets associated with different blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Monero, Ripple, and Zilliqa, to facilitate crypto theft.  Phorpiex , otherwise known as Trik, is known for its sextortion spam and ransomware campaigns as well as cryptojacking, a scheme that leverages the targets' devices such as computers, smartphones, and servers to secretly mine cryptocurrency without their consent or knowledge.   It's also infamous for its use of a technique called&nbsp; cry

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday said it took steps to disrupt the operations of a sophisticated "multi-component" botnet called Glupteba that approximately infected more than one million Windows computers across the globe and stored its command-and-control server addresses on Bitcoin's blockchain as a resilience mechanism.  As part of the efforts, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) said it partnered with the CyberCrime Investigation Group over the past year to terminate around 63 million Google Docs that were observed to have distributed the malware, alongside 1,183 Google Accounts, 908 Cloud Projects, and 870 Google Ads accounts that were associated with its distribution.  Google TAG said it worked with internet infrastructure providers and hosting providers, such as CloudFlare, to dismantle the malware by taking down servers and placing interstitial warning pages in front of the malicious domains.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly discovered botnet capable of staging distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks targeted unpatched Ribbon Communications (formerly Edgewater Networks) EdgeMarc appliances belonging to telecom service provider AT&amp;T by exploiting a four-year-old flaw in the network appliances.  Chinese tech giant Qihoo 360's Netlab network security division, which detected the botnet first on October 27, 2021, called it&nbsp; EwDoor , noting it observed 5,700 compromised IP addresses located in the U.S. during a brief three-hour window.   "So far, the EwDoor in our view has undergone three versions of updates, and its main functions can be summarized into two main categories of DDoS attacks and backdoor," the researchers&nbsp; noted . "Based on the attacked devices are telephone communication related, we presume that its main purpose is DDoS attacks, and gathering of sensitive information, such as call logs."   Propagating through a flaw in EdgeMarc devices, EwDoor supports a

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The notorious Emotet malware is staging a comeback of sorts&nbsp; nearly 10 months &nbsp;after a coordinated law enforcement operation dismantled its command-and-control infrastructure in late January 2021.  According to a&nbsp; new report &nbsp;from security researcher Luca Ebach, the infamous&nbsp; TrickBot &nbsp;malware is being used as an entry point to distribute what appears to be a new version of Emotet on systems previously infected by the former. The latest&nbsp; variant &nbsp;takes the form of a DLL file, with the first occurrence of the deployment being detected on November 14.   Europol&nbsp; dubbed &nbsp; Emotet &nbsp;as the "world's most dangerous malware" for its ability to act as a "door opener" for threat actors to obtain unauthorized access, becoming a precursor to many critical data theft and ransomware attacks. Interestingly, the loader operation enabled other malware families such as Trickbot, QakBot, and Ryuk to enter a machine.   The resurfacing is also significant not least because it follow

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers from Qihoo 360's Netlab security team have released details of a new evolving botnet called " Abcbot " that has been observed in the wild with worm-like propagation features to infect Linux systems and launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets.  While the earliest version of the botnet dates back to July 2021, new variants observed as recently as October 30 have been equipped with additional updates to strike Linux web servers with weak passwords and are susceptible to N-day vulnerabilities, including a custom implementation of DDoS functionality, indicating that the malware is under continuous development.  Netlab's findings also build on a report from Trend Micro early last month, which&nbsp; publicized &nbsp;attacks targeting Huawei Cloud with cryptocurrency-mining and cryptojacking malware. The intrusions were also notable for the fact that the malicious shell scripts specifically disabled a process designed to monitor and scan the ser

Cybersecurity researchers disclosed details of what they say is the "largest botnet" observed in the wild in the last six years, infecting over 1.6 million devices primarily located in China, with the goal of launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and inserting advertisements into HTTP websites visited by unsuspecting users.  Qihoo 360's Netlab security team dubbed the botnet " Pink " based on a sample obtained on November 21, 2019, owing to a large number of function names starting with "pink."   Mainly targeting MIPS-based fiber routers, the botnet leverages a combination of third-party services such as GitHub, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, and central command-and-control (C2) servers for its bots to controller communications, not to mention completely encrypting the transmission channels to prevent the victimized devices from being taken over.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ukrainian law enforcement authorities on Monday disclosed the arrest of a hacker responsible for the creation and management of a "powerful botnet" consisting of over 100,000 enslaved devices that was used to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and spam attacks on behalf of paid customers.  The unnamed individual, from the Ivano-Frankivsk region of the country, is also said to have leveraged the automated network to detect vulnerabilities in websites and break into them as well as stage brute-force attacks in order to guess email passwords. The Ukrainian police agency said it conducted a raid of the suspect's residence and seized their computer equipment as evidence of illegal activity.   "He looked for customers on the closed forums and Telegram chats and payments were made via blocked electronic payment systems," the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a press statement.

Russian internet giant Yandex has been the target of a record-breaking distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack by a new botnet called Mēris.  The botnet is believed to have pummeled the company's web infrastructure with millions of HTTP requests, before hitting a peak of 21.8 million requests per second (RPS), dwarfing a recent botnet-powered attack that came to light last month,&nbsp; bombarding &nbsp;an unnamed Cloudflare customer in the financial industry with 17.2 million RPS.  Russian DDoS mitigation service Qrator Labs, which disclosed details of the attack on Thursday, called&nbsp; Mēris &nbsp;— meaning "Plague" in the Latvian language — a "botnet of a new kind."&nbsp;   "It is also clear that this particular botnet is still growing. There is a suggestion that the botnet could grow in force through password brute-forcing, although we tend to neglect that as a slight possibility.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The operators of the Mozi IoT botnet have been taken into custody by Chinese law enforcement authorities, nearly two years after the malware emerged on the threat landscape in September 2019.  News of the arrest, which originally&nbsp; happened &nbsp;in June, was&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by researchers from Netlab, the network research division of Chinese internet security company Qihoo 360, earlier this Monday, detailing its involvement in the operation.   "Mozi uses a P2P [peer-to-peer] network structure, and one of the 'advantages' of a P2P network is that it is robust, so even if some of the nodes go down, the whole network will carry on, and the remaining nodes will still infect other vulnerable devices, that is why we can still see Mozi spreading," said Netlab, which spotted the botnet for the first time in late 2019.

Mozi IoT Botnet Now Also Targets Netgear, Huawei, and ZTE Network Gateways<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/mozi-iot-botnet-now-also-targets.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mozi, a peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet known to target IoT devices, has gained new capabilities that allow it to achieve persistence on network gateways manufactured by Netgear, Huawei, and ZTE, according to new findings.  "Network gateways are a particularly juicy target for adversaries because they are ideal as initial access points to corporate networks," researchers at Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence Center and Section 52 at Azure Defender for IoT&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up. "By infecting routers, they can perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks—via HTTP hijacking and DNS spoofing—to compromise endpoints and deploy ransomware or cause safety incidents in OT facilities."   First&nbsp; documented &nbsp;by Netlab 360 in December 2019, Mozi has a history of infecting routers and digital video recorders in order to assemble them into an IoT botnet, which could be abused for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, data exfiltration, and payload execution

Threat actors behind the infamous&nbsp; TrickBot &nbsp;malware have been linked to a new ransomware strain named "Diavol," according to the latest research.  Diavol and Conti ransomware payloads were deployed on different systems in a case of an unsuccessful attack targeting one of its customers earlier this month, researchers from Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs said last week.  TrickBot, a banking Trojan first detected in 2016, has been traditionally a Windows-based crimeware solution, employing different modules to perform a wide range of malicious activities on target networks, including credential theft and conduct ransomware attacks.&nbsp;   Despite efforts by law enforcement to neutralize the bot network, the ever-evolving malware has proven to be a&nbsp; resilient threat , what with the Russia-based operators — dubbed " Wizard Spider " — quickly adapting new tools to carry out further attacks.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday revealed details about a new Mirai-inspired botnet called "mirai_ptea" that leverages an undisclosed vulnerability in digital video recorders (DVR) provided by KGUARD to propagate and carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.  Chinese security firm Netlab 360&nbsp; pinned &nbsp;the first probe against the flaw on March 23, 2021, before it detected active exploitation attempts by the botnet on June 22, 2021.   The Mirai botnet, since&nbsp; emerging on the scene &nbsp;in 2016, has been linked to a string of large-scale DDoS attacks, including one against&nbsp; DNS service provider Dyn &nbsp;in October 2016, causing major internet platforms and services to remain inaccessible to users in Europe and North America.  Since then,&nbsp; numerous &nbsp; variants &nbsp;of&nbsp; Mirai &nbsp;have&nbsp; sprung up &nbsp;on&nbsp;the threat landscape, in part due to the availability of its source code on the Internet.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new wormable botnet that spreads via GitHub and Pastebin to install cryptocurrency miners and backdoors on target systems has returned with expanded capabilities to compromise web applications, IP cameras, and routers.  Early last month, researchers from Juniper Threat Labs documented a crypto-mining campaign called " Gitpaste-12 ," which used GitHub to host malicious code containing as many as 12 known attack modules that are executed via commands downloaded from a Pastebin URL.  The attacks occurred during a 12-day period starting from October 15, 2020, before both the Pastebin URL and repository were shut down on October 30, 2020.   Now according to Juniper, the&nbsp; second wave of attacks &nbsp;began on November 10 using payloads from a different GitHub repository, which, among others, contains a Linux crypto-miner ("ls"), a file with a list of passwords for brute-force attempts ("pass"), and a local privilege escalation exploit for x86_64 Linux systems.
